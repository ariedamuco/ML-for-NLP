   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise to comment on a development that took place in my State this week. It was with great sadness that I heard of the phasing out of the Oldsmobile line of cars within the General Motors family. Over the last 105 years, Oldsmobile has been a Lansing, MI, and a State institution and, obviously, a national and international one as well. It was started 105 years ago when Ransom Eli Olds of Lansing, MI, teamed with Frank Clark, the son of a small carriage shop operator, to achieve what many believed impossible. They successfully produced a self-contained gasoline-powered carriage, and with it Oldsmobile was officially born in 1897. 
   Throughout its history, Oldsmobile has enjoyed a number of firsts: the first assembly line; and with the production of the curved dash, the first mass producer of gasoline cars; in 1905, two Oldsmobiles finished the very first transcontinental race from New York to Portland, OR, in 45 days; in 1940, models featured the Hydra-Matic drive, making this lineup the first vehicles with fully automatic transmissions; in 1966, Oldsmobile introduced the Toronado, the first modern-day front-wheel drive car; in 1974, that Toronado became the first American car to offer a driver's side airbag. 
   Millions of Americans have come to love their Oldsmobiles. An Olds convertible was the standard for transporting a Homecoming queen or a float parade when I was growing up. And an Oldsmobile sedan was the epitome of the middle-class family dream. All of this was made possible by the hard work and the commitment to affordable quality that was the hallmark of Oldsmobile in that division of General Motors. 
   On a personal level, I have a special stake in all of this, as well. Not only did I grow up in Lansing, MI, the home of Oldsmobile, but for almost 20 years my dad worked on the line at the Oldsmobile main assembly plant there. It is  where he got his start, where my family came to truly appreciate how much the automobile industry means, not just to families such as ours but to our State, and especially how much the Oldsmobile meant to Michigan--Lansing, in particular. 
   I am sad, therefore, to see the Oldsmobile go, as we have known it, but I am confident General Motors will continue to make quality, safe automobiles for generations to come. As we bring down the curtain on the Oldsmobile, I rise today to offer my praise to that company, to those who started it, and their families and descendents who still remain in the Lansing area and in Michigan; also, to all those workers who, as my father, worked over the years for that Oldsmobile division of General Motors. I think each and every one of them took to their jobs a great satisfaction, a commitment to hard work, and a tremendous pride in the craftsmanship that went into making the automobile for many generations one of this country's favorite lines of vehicles. 
   I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will comment briefly on a matter of relevance both personally to me and to my State. Since the election, as a consequence of my defeat, I have heard from a number of people from the Arab American community, both in Michigan and across the United States. As a Lebanese American myself, I have been very proud to be, at least for the last several years, the only Arab American Member of this Chamber. 
   A number of folks from that community expressed their disappointment in the results of the campaign. I take the floor today to thank so many people who have been in touch, but also to make several points that I hope will be heard by members of the community, to be taken into account as they consider the results of this election, as well as the future. 
   First, I note that in recent years I believe the Arab American community has become a key part of the American political process. The participation of the community has continued to increase both in my State of Michigan as well as across the country. Not only are people voting in greater numbers as a percentage of the community, and for many taking the first step of participating in the elections, but their activism in Michigan and other States has grown considerably. I take great pride in seeing that happen. 
   In addition, we have seen a number of Arab Americans rise to leadership positions at the local level of government all the way up to statewide offices. In the Congress itself we have several Members of Arab heritage on the House side who were elected in the most recent campaigns. 
   Much of this progress, I think, has translated into progress on issues of importance to the Arab American community in the last 6 years. I have been proud during my term in the Senate to have worked on behalf of a number of important issues relevant to the community. One has been to see the travel ban to Lebanon lifted in 1997, which has opened more opportunities for better relations between the United States and Lebanon, and also for more commercial activity between the two countries. 
   This Chamber passed a resolution decrying intolerance toward people of Islamic faith in this country, a much needed statement, I think, for the Congress to make so we can be on record consistently as opposing intolerance toward people of any religious faith. We have supported important programs that have affected the Middle East. One that we have worked on in our office with Senator FEINSTEIN and others is the Seeds of Peace Program, which I believe will have a long-term and positive impact on the relationships between countries in the Middle East, including Lebanon, Israel, Jordan, Egypt, Yemen, as well as the Palestinians. 
   I think the potential for the future is even greater. I think it is very likely in the area of public policy that the people from the Arab American community will rise and play an ever active role and a greater role, as they have done in other fields of endeavor. In America's business community, we have many Arab American leaders today who are heading up important companies from one end of the country to the other. In sports and entertainment and the arts, we likewise have seen Arab Americans excel. In education, the same is true. Indeed, the level of educational attainment by young people of Arab American background continues to be one of the most important components of the Arab American ethnic communities' contribution to the United States. 
   I am very proud of my heritage. I have talked to many other Members of this Chamber about my background over the years. I am glad to have helped in a small way--to have played a role in moving forward some of the policy objectives I mentioned a few minutes ago. I hope, to some extent, that has helped encourage others in their own communities, States, or even perhaps at the Federal level to do so, as well. 
   Recently in Dearborn, MI, home to the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the United States, I was approached by a woman who had a young son in the seventh grade, saying how happy he was to know a Senator shared his Arab American heritage. I hope that in my brief career in the Senate maybe there are others who have similarly sparked an interest in government because they happen to be part of that same community to which I belong. 
   My message is to praise the community, especially, but also to say to any who have harbored a sense of disappointment with the results of the election, I hope that disappointment will not be long standing. It certainly isn't the case for myself. I encourage people in the community to continue to play an active role in politics. Obviously, our political process inevitably produces success and failure from election to election. 
   For people new to the process, sometimes they misunderstand and treat a setback as something that should discourage future involvement. I hope that across the Arab American community, and especially for those who first got active in the political process with this election, that they will continue to play an active role, even increase their involvement, and hopefully encourage others to do likewise. That would be invaluable to the community, and certainly from my point of view, it would be the preferable outcome. 
   My grandparents came a century ago from Lebanon, where they left behind everything to risk their fortunes on America. As is the case with people not just from the Arab American community but so many other immigrant communities, they came here with very little in the way of material possessions, but they came with a great deal of desire and energy and the hope that by working hard and playing by the rules they could make a contribution. 
   As I have said to the others on this floor in the past, they did not necessarily come here assuming they would have a grandson who would be in the Senate, but they wanted to live in a country where that was possible. Indeed, that is what our country always will be. And I think it always will. I am proud to have had the opportunity to fulfill, probably in the utmost way, the hopes that were brought here by my grandparents when they arrived. 
   I think, as I look back on my service in the Senate, perhaps more than anything else, will be the source of pride that I take with me as I leave the Chamber today. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, if I might, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his kind remarks. I had occasion a couple of days ago to speak to the Senate. At that time I expressed publicly my thanks to him. He was not in the Chamber at the time, so I reiterate it here. We worked, I think, in a very constructive way on a number of issues as members of the Subcommittee on Immigration and on a variety of other issues he has mentioned here as well. I thank him for his remarks today.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, as I leave the service of the Senate, I would like to take a moment and recognize the service of my dedicated staff over these last six years. Pay in a Congressional office is not great, Mr. President, the hours are incredibly long, and often times the work they do goes unheralded. But still these staffers dedicate their time and effort to helping the people of Michigan and advancing their interests. 
   I would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the people of the State of Michigan, to thank them all for their dedicated and tireless service. 
   Mr. President, at this point I would like to enter into the RECORD a list of those people that have served on my staff, both here in Washington and back in Michigan, as a way of thanking them.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to the memory of an outstanding leader, a philanthropist who knew no limits, and a distinguished public servant whose integrity and decency made him a role-model to all who knew him. A few weeks ago, we in the State of Michigan mourned the passing of Ambassador David Hermelin. I suppose it is a little presumptuous to suggest that only the State of Michigan beams with pride in our association with Ambassador Hermelin, for the organizations that he led, the political leaders he counseled, and the communities to which he dedicated his life, literally span the globe.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay respect to a dear friend of mine who passed away recently. Salim Y. Sarafa helped start the Chaldean-Iraqi Association of Michigan, became its first president in 1954 and served three terms in that post. The association's first facility was built in 1979, and now includes the Southfield Manor and the Shenandoah Golf and Country Club. 
   Salim served on the St. Michael's School Board and was vice-chairman of the Associated Food Dealers of Michigan. He also helped develop a school that taught students to read, write, and speak Arabic. He was active in the National Association of Arab-Americans, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee and the Republican Party at the state and national levels. 
   He was born in Telkaif, Iraq, in 1921. He earned an education degree from the University of Baghdad and became a high school teacher in 1942. He went on to teach in Kut in southern Iraq for four years before being promoted to assistant principal of a school near Baghdad. He left teaching to become director general of the Iraqi Department of Public Works. 
   Salim came to the United States in 1951. While living with the George Jonna family, he worked in their store, Union Pacific Market, until he opened his own store in 1953. He met and married Margarett George that same year. 
   In 1957, he and four partners opened Big Dipper Market, Detroit's largest independent supermarket at the time. He also was involved in a construction company, convenience store and wholesale business over the years. He got into the real estate business in 1968 and remained active until retiring in 1995. 
   He is survived by three sons, Joe, Michael, and Mark; two daughters, Judy Jonna and Doreen Mangrum; and ten granchildren. His wife Margarett died in 1998. 
   Salim and Margarett Sarafa lived their lives dedicated to the American way while preserving the core values of the Chaldean culture. They were able to raise their family and start their business in the land of the free while never forgetting the people who were not blessed with the same chance. I am so very proud to call them my friends.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, it is rare in this Chamber for incumbent Senators who have lost on election day to still have the privilege of addressing the Senate again, at least in their capacity of finishing out their terms. For me, if there is a silver lining behind this extended session of which we are a part, it is because it gives me a chance to thank people--friends, supporters, staff, colleagues, and others--who have made it possible for me, a grandson of immigrants, to serve and succeed here. 
   I begin today by making some comments and thanking people who have made a difference. 
   First, I thank my Senate colleagues with whom I have worked over the last 6 years. I especially express my gratitude for the majority leaders under whom I have served--Senator Bob Dole and Senator TRENT LOTT--for their confidence in me, for making me part of their circle of key advisers, for their support on both legislative and political matters and, most importantly, for their friendship. 
   I extend the same heartfelt thanks to the other members of our leadership teams over the last 6 years: To Senator DON NICKLES for whom I served as deputy whip for 4 years; to our conference chairman, THAD COCHRAN, who served when I first arrived here, and Senator CONNIE MACK; to our Senate campaign committee chairman, MITCH MCCONNELL, and the late Senator PAUL COVERDELL; to the Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee Senator LARRY CRAIG; to our new Conference Secretary Senator KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, and so many others who have provided me with guidance and leadership during the time I have been here. 
   I also take special note of the people with whom I have served as a member of their committees: To our Commerce Committee chairman, JOHN MCCAIN, who has been a great friend and supporter and through whose help I have been able to pass significant legislation that came from our Commerce Committee agenda. 
   I thank our Judiciary Committee chairman, ORRIN HATCH, who helped me get on his committee my very first year here and whose support on that committee helped me to achieve a number of personal objectives with respect to legislative goals and who worked closely with me and his staff worked closely with my staff as we fought a number of very important battles in the Senate. 
   I thank my good friend Senator PETE DOMENICI, who chairs the Budget Committee on which I sat for 6 years. When I came to the Senate, I met with Senator DOMENICI. At the time, I was selected for that committee, and we talked about our goals and hopes that some day we might advance a balanced budget to complete and see the Nation balance its budget. Many people thought we would never achieve that in our lifetime, and yet 3 short years after I arrived on the committee, and under PETE DOMENICI's great leadership, that objective was realized. 
   I thank the chairman of the Small Business Committee, KIT BOND, whose friendship has helped me in legislative battles of recent years. I have only been on that committee 2 years, but his leadership also has been important to my success in the Chamber. 
   I extend my thanks to all of my colleagues. There are many close friends who are part of this Chamber, people with whom my family and I have become close in the last 6 years and others who have already departed the Chamber but with whom we remain close. 
   Senator CHUCK HAGEL from Nebraska is here with me today. I especially thank him for his great friendship and support. Senators JEFF SESSIONS, SUSAN COLLINS, JUDD GREGG and MIKE DEWINE have also done me the honor of helping me in my legislative efforts as well as being my friends over these last six years, and for that 
   I want to thank them. And finally for my Republican colleagues, I want to thank all the other members of my freshman class, the folks with whom I came in 1995, and who helped so substantially change the direction of this country: Senator SANTORUM, Senator INHOFE, Senator THOMPSON, Senator FRIST, Senator ASHCROFT, Senator KYL, Senator SNOWE, Senator GRAMS, and as I mentioned before, Senator DEWINE. 
   I reach across the aisle and thank the many colleagues on the Democratic side with whom I have worked on so many bipartisan issues in the last 6 years: 
   To CARL LEVIN, our senior Senator from Michigan with whom I have worked very closely on many issues of importance to our State; 
   To TED KENNEDY, my ranking member on the Senate Immigration Subcommittee which I chaired. We have been very successful in passing a number of pieces of legislation through the bipartisan cooperation we have achieved in that subcommittee; 
   To JOE LIEBERMAN, who has been the lead cosponsor of my American Community Renewal Act, and other progrowth initiatives; 
   To RON WYDEN, my partner in so many high-technology initiatives; 
   To RUSS FEINGOLD, BOB GRAHAM, and others who have worked closely with me. 
   I also thank the many friends and supporters and mentors who have helped me to arrive in the Senate and in a lengthy political career in my State of Michigan. There are many  people who are part of that success. It would be impossible to name all of them. I want to single out, though, four people who played particularly important roles: 
   Former Michigan Senator Bob Griffin whose campaigns and staffs I worked on many years ago and a role model for me in that he was the last Republican Senator from my State and a man whose integrity and leadership in the Senate were well recognized. He served ultimately as whip on the Republican side. His guidance and friendship from the time I was in college has meant a great deal to my political success and my personal success as well. 
   To our great Governor John Engler, who has been a political friend and colleague in Michigan politics since 1971. Without his support and help, I would not have been successful in my campaign for the Senate or other roles I played in Michigan politics. 
   To former Congressman Guy Vander Jagt with whom I served as cochairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee in 1991 and 1992 when I made my first appearance on the legislative side of Washington working on Capitol Hill for the first time. 
   And especially to a great friend, former Vice President Dan Quayle on whose staff I served as deputy chief of staff in 1990 and 1991, my first assignment in Washington in Government service at the Federal level. 
   I thank all of those individuals, and the others I have not had a chance today to name, for having helped me get to this role and being effective in it.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I also acknowledge that in addition to this great staff--and I do want to thank them here on the floor publicly for their great performance on my behalf and the many achievements I am going to talk about in a minute that we have been able to accomplish--I also note that none of us would have been able to get as much done as we did without the help of the tremendous staff that serves us in the Senate as a Chamber: The people who work the floor, our pages, the folks who work at the front here who handle the clerk roles, and the parliamentary roles, and so on. I thank them. 
   I thank the people who serve on the leadership staffs of both parties who have been great friends and who have helped us to chart the very complicated parliamentary waters we have to so often navigate, the folks who work on the staffs of the committees on which I have served that have helped us to pass legislation, and to the other people who work in the Senate, from the Capitol Police, who help us in so many ways that go unnoted, to the folks in the libraries and the Congressional Research Service, and in the Cloakrooms. 
   To all of those people, and others I have probably forgotten, I say thank you because it has really been a very enjoyable part of this job to work with such nice people, people who give 100 percent to this Chamber and to America, and often without any recognition at all. I hope that we will continue to always be served in this body by people of such great skill and talent. 
   Finally, I thank the people of Michigan. They gave me and my family the chance to come to Washington to represent them in the Senate. 
   I thank you for what I consider to be the most tremendous honor that any American can have bestowed upon them by their friends and neighbors in their State, and for their tremendous support throughout my 6 years in the Senate.  
   I am very proud of the accomplishments I have achieved. I have worked very hard--I hope in most cases in an effective way--to help the people of Michigan, to make sure my constituents have had their voices heard in the Senate, and to make certain that the Federal Government is responsive to their needs. 
   Speaking of accomplishments, although I spent only a relevantly brief time here in the Senate, I am very proud of what my staff and I have been able to accomplish for the people of Michigan and for the country. 
   In 1994, a group of freshmen were elected here. Eleven of us came in to basically create a new majority. In 1995, I came to the Senate as part of a historic class of Republican Senators --the class that gave Republicans control of Congress for the first time in decades. I believe we were sent to Washington to accomplish a very clear agenda: to balance the Federal budget, to reduce the tax burden, to reform the welfare system, and to make Washington more accountable. 
   I am proud to say, as I look back on our 6 years, that I believe we have delivered on those promises. 
   We balanced the budget in 1998--and we have kept it balanced every year since. We have done it this past year without using one penny of the Social Security trust fund surplus to get the job done. 
   We reformed the welfare system, reducing the welfare rolls by over a third. 
   We provided parents with a $500-per-child tax credit and investors a cut in the capital gains tax. 
   And we made Congress more accountable by requiring Members to live by the same rules and regulations and mandates we impose on the rest of the country. 
   I am proud of those achievements, which I think, of course, are achievements of this body as a whole. 
   I am also proud of some of the things which I have been able to accomplish during the last 6 years. I am very proud of the fact that, including today, I have never missed a single rollcall vote on the floor of the Senate. I have just cast, I think, my 2,002nd consecutive rollcall vote. 
   In my view, voting in the Senate is the single most important duty that we can, as Senators, perform on behalf of our constituents. It is what the people of our States elect us to do. I am glad I have been here every single day for the people of Michigan to perform that responsibility. 
   I am also proud of the fact that in a fairly short period of time I have been able to author 22 pieces of legislation that have been signed into law. I am proud of that legislative record. 
   As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I took a special interest in drug and crime issues. My first bill to become law prevented the U.S. Sentencing Commission from reducing prison sentences for crack-cocaine offenders. Had that bill not passed, the sentences would have been automatically reduced. 
   Later, with my staff, we wrote the Prison Conditions Litigation Reform Act, which helped reduce prisoner lawsuits and return control of our prisons from judges back to local authorities. 
   And just a few months ago, the President signed into law the Samantha Reid Date-Rape Drug Prohibition Act. Samantha Reid was a Rockwood, MI, teenager who died after drinking a can of Mountain Dew she did not know had been laced with the deadly date rape drug GHB. Our law amends the Controlled Substances Act by adding GHB to the list of Schedule 1 controlled substances, which also includes heroin and cocaine. 
   As a member of both the Judiciary and Commerce Committees, I focused on a wide range of high-technology issues that I believe are critical to the continued growth and prosperity of this country. 
   My American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act increased the number of skilled professional visas to help with critical labor shortages, especially in the entrepreneurial high-tech sector. 
   The law also funds 10,000 new college scholarships annually for low-income students for studies in math, engineering, and computer science, and job training for unemployed Americans through the Jobs Partnership Act. 
   I was also the author of two new laws dealing with electronic commerce: the Government Paperwork Elimination Act and the Electronic Signatures and Global and National Commerce Act. 
   The first law set forth a timetable for Federal agencies to accept electronically signed and transmitted records and forms from businesses and individuals. The second law ensured that contracts agreed to over the Internet using digital signatures would have the same legal validity as contracts agreed to in the paper world using pen and ink signatures. 
   Both of these laws have laid the groundwork, I think, for continued growth and expansion of electronic commerce in the years to come. 
   Other laws which I have been involved with--I am especially proud of the passage, this year, of the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act and the College Scholarship Fraud Prevention Act; and in the previous year, the Child Passenger Protection Act. 
   I am especially proud of having been the Senate sponsor of legislation that conferred the Congressional Gold Medal on one of my constituents, Mrs. Rosa Parks. 
   One area that I spent a great deal of time working on in this Chamber, as many know, is the area of immigration. As a grandson of immigrants, I am especially proud of the role that I tried to play in changing the tone of the debate over immigration in this Chamber. In the mid-1990s, my party--the Republican Party--in 
   my judgment, seemed to have lost its way on immigration. It had strayed from the inclusive, proimmigration philosophy of President Ronald Reagan toward the more protectionist and nativist views of a vocal minority within the Republican ranks. 
   In 1997, I helped lead a bipartisan group of Senators--from PHIL GRAMM, MIKE DEWINE, and SAM BROWNBACK, to RUSS FEINGOLD, JOE LIEBERMAN, PAUL WELLSTONE, and others--to defeat a misguided effort to slash legal immigration to this country. 
   I believe, with all of my heart, that America should remain--as President Reagan said--the ``Shining City on the Hill,'' welcoming those who play by the rules and who contribute to society. 
   I would say, despite the ugly campaign that was run in my State against me by some of these anti-immigrant hate groups, I am absolutely confident that the bipartisan coalition for legal immigration that was built in this Chamber will remain strong long after I have left the Senate. 
   I am also proud of what I have been able to deliver to the people of the State of Michigan on issues important to our State. 
   I am very proud of what I have been able to do with respect to increasing transportation funding; stopping an effort to move to Washington control of the Great Lakes, and increasing environmental funding for the Great Lakes; restoring Medicare reimbursements for Michigan hospitals; and protecting our auto workers' jobs with respect to issues that threaten the auto industry. 
   I intend to continue to fight--perhaps not in the elective political arena or in public life specifically, but in whatever roles that I might be able to play--for tax and regulatory policies that strengthen American competitiveness and economic growth, to ensure strong national security, tough laws against criminals, and to have immigration policy that respects America's great traditions, having schools that are second to none, training for 21st-century jobs, community renewal efforts to empower the poor, and a transportation and infrastructure system that makes us prepared to be competitive in the 21st century. 
   As I close, I have a few moments upon which I will reflect. When one comes to the end of a 6-year period here, there are a lot of memories. It is probably possible for one to speak long into the night about the various things one recalls. I do remember being sworn in here that first day just a few steps in front of me by Vice President GORE, holding our family Bible and very nervously taking the oath of office because it was such an important moment in my life. 
   I remember the first day I sat in the President's chair presiding over the Senate. I considered it to be quite an important honor to be given that duty. Then by the second and third day that I performed it, I realized exactly how  that responsibility was viewed by the other Members of this Chamber. This week I asked once again to have the chance to preside because I wanted to never forget just exactly how meaningful it is to serve in this Chamber. 
   I remember passing our first bill with regard to sentencing and seeing it signed into law. I remember standing at this desk and casting the very first vote on the impeachment trial that we had in January of 1999 with respect to the impeachment of President Clinton, an unbelievably historic moment to have been a part. And of course I will never forget today, the chance to be here with colleagues and staff and friends speaking one last time in the Senate. Indeed, it is these moments, the chance to stand up and to make one's case for one's State, for one's beliefs, that will stay with me probably more than any other. 
   In closing, I will just make a few short observations. First, this institution has been served by great people. All too often we tend to take for granted the truly extraordinary political leaders who work here every day. I personally consider it a great honor and privilege to serve with people who will long be recognized, probably for the entire history of our country, as giants in this Chamber--leaders such as Senator Bob Dole, our President pro tempore STROM THURMOND, retiring Member DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN, and of course the great Senator from West Virginia ROBERT BYRD--two on each side of the aisle whose contributions to their Nation and to this Chamber will never be forgotten, and two on each side of the aisle whose leadership I hope all of us will be able to in some ways emulate in our careers. I know there will be others who are serving here and with whom I have served who someday will be looked upon the same way, as history records their accomplishments. 
   The second observation I have is for those sitting in the gallery, watching and paying attention to the action of the Senate. Sometimes the media and others tend to focus too much on the areas in which we disagree in this Chamber. Indeed, we do have our disagreements. That is why we have a democratic system that gives each side an opportunity to fight for their causes. 
   But as the Presiding Officer knows, in the committees and usually on the floor of this Chamber, we work together on a bipartisan basis to get things done for the American people. More often than not, things pass here unanimously. They do so quietly. They do so by the unanimous-consent agreements that don't get reported very often. Indeed, much of America's business is accomplished without rancor and strife, without divisive debates. At the same time, the Founding Fathers created the Senate as the saucer to cool the passions of the day. 
   I have observed that passion for philosophy, at least for 
   ideas, reigns here in the Senate. I can remember during the last 6 years from the balanced budget amendment debates, when I first got here, to the debates over Bosnia and other foreign affairs issues, to the impeachment trial and so on, while we in the Senate obviously have a reputation for being a deliberative body, we also are a body in which the passions of the country are best reflected in the debates we have. I hope that will always be the tradition as well. 
   Indeed, I think the Senate really does reflect democracy at its finest. Over 150 years ago, De Tocqueville observed:  
   I confess that in America I saw more than America; I saw the image of democracy itself, with its inclinations, its character, its prejudices, and its passions, in order to learn what we have to fear or hope from its progress.  
   Some say this America, this image of democracy, no longer exists. But I say that it does exist, right here in this great Chamber. 
   I will miss the Senate. I will miss the institution, and I will miss the people. Being a Senator has been my dream job. I hope that during my 6 years here I have contributed in some small way to the rich history of what has been and forever will be called ``the world's greatest deliberative body in the world's greatest democracy.'' It is a long distance from being the grandson of immigrants to this floor. 
   I know when my grandparents came here, they never dreamt that their grandson or anyone in the family would end up as a Member of the U.S. Senate, but they came to America because they wanted to live in a place in which something such as that could happen. This is the one country where something such as that not only can happen in the family of the Abrahams, but in many other families happened all the time. It is the greatest thing about America. I am proud and believe, as I leave the Chamber, that I have helped contribute in my own small way during these 6 years to making sure that America always remains that country. 
   I thank everyone I have mentioned, but I especially thank my family, some of whom are here today, my wife Jane and my daughters Betsy and Julie, without whom none of this would have been possible for me. Their support in every way and their love and affection have made the difference in my life. 
   As I leave the Senate, I will only say that I hope all Americans will in their own way find a way to appreciate the greatness of this democracy. I hope all of my colleagues will continue to fight to make sure that that tradition, that Nation which my grandparents and so many others fought for, so many others strove to come to be part of, will always be available to those who seek freedom and liberty and opportunity and that that dream will be forever part of our great country. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. On a second matter, this language uses the phrase ``resource improvement'' as one principle in encouraging the states to develop a common conservation standard. This phrase is intended to embody the concept of improvement of the quality of the natural resource, not the development of the resource. Is that the understanding of the chairman and ranking member?

   Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the chairman, ranking member, and my colleague from Michigan. Mr. President, Senator LEVIN has been a leader in the effort to protect the Great Lakes on a wide variety of fronts. Clearly today's work will not completely guarantee the protection of this great resource, but I believe it is a big step in the right direction. I want to thank Senator LEVIN for his help in this matter, particularly for his work to eliminate the likelihood of unintended consequences from this legislation. I look forward to working with him in the future as we fight to protect this great resource.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, at the Hispanic College Funds Annual Scholarship Awards Banquet earlier this month, Ms. Yalile Ramirez, recipient of the Hispanic College Fund Award for 2000-2001, gave a speech regarding the upliftment of the Hispanic-American community which I found to be extremely insightful. I rise today not only to insert her remarks into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, but also to salute an extraordinary young woman with a bright future ahead of her. 
   Ms. Ramirez was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. She is currently a senior at Michigan State University, where she is pursuing a double Bachelor's degree in International Relations and Finance. In May of this year, she graduated from the University's James Madison College of International Relations, so she is now focusing her efforts on her financial studies. 
   In addition to receiving the Hispanic College Fund Award, Ms. Ramirez has received the Bill Gates Millennium Scholar Award. She made the Dean's List in 1998, 1999 and 2000, and in 1997 was presented with the National Dean's List Award. 
   Ms. Ramirez is a member of the Women in Business Student Association, the Phi Beta Delta National Honor Society, the American Advertising Federation: Research Team Leader, and the Phi Sigma Pi Co-Ed National Honors Fraternity. She is also a Mentor Program Coordinator, and spends her remaining free time with aerobics, running and volunteering. 
   I applaud Ms. Ramirez on her many achievements both on and off the campus of Michigan State University. She is not only a dedicated student but also a dedicated member of society, concerned with a great deal more than her own success. As is clearly illustrated in her remarks, she cares deeply about the upliftment of America's Latino population, and believes that this upliftment can best occur through economic empowerment--attaining positions of leadership within the business community. In the not too distant future, I look forward to seeing Ms. Yalile Ramirez become one of these  leaders. With that having been said, I ask to print her remarks of October 5, 2000, in the RECORD.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Honorable Clayton E. Preisel, who is retiring on December 31, 2000, after an extraordinary career spanning over 50 years. During this time, he has served in the Marine Corps, been a teacher and school administrator, and, for the past 18 years, presided over the Lapeer County Probate Court. Whatever the forum, Judge Preisel has been a leader and an inspiration to those around him. 
   Judge Preisel was born on January 29, 1927. He graduated from Imlay City High School in 1945, and departed for  the Marines in July of that same year. He served until August of 1946, and then returned to the State of Michigan to attend Michigan State University. He graduated from MSU in 1951 with a degree in Agriculture. 
   After graduation, Judge Preisel moved to Carson City, Michigan, and began teaching. After four years, he returned home to Imlay City, where he continued his teaching career. He taught in Imlay City until 1969, and spent the final two years of his tenure there as both a teacher and a school administrator. During this time, Judge Preisel also doubled as a student, obtaining a Master's of Science degree in 1956, and, in 1968, receiving a Jurist Doctorate degree from the Detroit College of Law. 
   Upon receiving his law degree, Judge Preisel entered into private practice, where he stayed until 1982, when he was elected to serve as Lapeer County Probate Judge. He has held this position for the past 18 years, and during his time on the bench has become respected not only for his knowledge of the law but also for his sensical approach to its application. Individuals leave Judge Preisel's courtroom with the knowledge that they have been treated fairly, which in my mind is the most worthy thing that can be said of a Judge. 
   Judge Preisel has always found time to partake in community service. He was a member of the Imlay School Board from 1969-1983. He has also been involved in 4-H, the Lions Club, the Community Foundation, United Way, Kids In New Directions (KIND), Big Brothers-Big Sisters, and the Lapeer County Bar Association. 
   Judge Preisel's retirement will allow him to spend more time with his family. He and his wife, Beulah Joann Anderson, who celebrated their 50th Anniversary on September 9th, 2000, have four children (Kathleen, Janet, Karen and James), and five grandchildren (Heather, Jason, Alysha, Katelyn and Steven). 
   I applaud Judge Preisel for his extraordinary service to Lapeer County and the State of Michigan. His leadership in all phases of his career has been exceptional and will be dearly missed. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate and thank the Honorable Clayton E. Preisel on a wonderful and successful career, and wish him the best of luck in retirement.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dr. James Hendricks, who is retiring this year from a career in education which spanned 43 years, and included 33 years of dedicated service to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, Michigan. For the past 22 years, Dr. Hendricks has served as Director of the School of Education there, and in this capacity he has illustrated to fellow professors and students alike that, while there is no single formula for successful education, there is a single foundation--caring deeply for each and every student in the classroom. 
   Dr. Hendricks grew up on a farm in rural Indiana. As a child, his interests were extremely atypical. He loved the opera and classical music, and often chose to read a book during recess while his classmates played games. His experiences at school were to help him later in life, as he gained a sensitivity towards children with different interests, and developed educational strategies with the goal of ``just and inclusive classrooms.'' 
   Dr. Hendricks graduated from the University of Indiana, where he studied English, Philosophy, History and Spanish, in 1957. Following his graduation, he turned down a job at his local bank to teach elementary school in Southport, Indiana. He immediately knew that he had made the right decision, and it did not take long for him to fall in love with teaching. His goal during those years was to help ``all children find a happiness in being in that classroom.'' 
   Recognizing a need to further his own education, Dr. Hendricks returned to the University of Indiana after three years of teaching in Southport. In 1962, he received his Master's Degree in History and Education. He then spent three years in Bloomington as both a graduate assistant and research fellow before coming to Marquette to serve as an Assistant Professor at Northern Michigan from 1965-67. 
   In 1968, he returned to the University of Indiana, and received his Doctoral Degree in History and the Philosophy of Education. Following this, he accepted a position as Assistant Professor in the Department of Education at Portland State University, and during his time there helped the university set up its educational doctoral program. In 1969, Dr. Hendricks returned to Marquette and the faculty of Northern Michigan University. 
   During Dr. Hendricks' tenure at Northern Michigan, the Education Department has been rejuvenated. Admission standards for students have been elevated and the curriculum has been deepened. From the time that they decide they want to be teachers, students are required to gain hands-on experience in classrooms throughout Marquette County, where they learn from proven teachers, as well as from students. In addition, veteran elementary and secondary school teachers have joined the University's faculty in an effort to assist student teachers. All of this equates to students graduating the Education Department who are experienced and knowledgeable enough to immediately handle the pressure and responsibility of having their own classroom. 
   Dr. Hendricks' good works within the community were surpassed only by those of his wife, Sandra. Mrs. Hendricks greatly impacted the City of Marquette with her volunteerism, while at the same time remaining a devoted mother to the couple's three children. Before her death in 1998, she spent time baking brownies for cancer patients at Beacon House in Marquette, and then brightening their days by hand delivering the goods and staying to chat with the patients. She loved Christmas and each year sponsored the Alternative Gifts Fair, which benefitted Third World artists. The event still takes place each December at St. Paul's Episcopal Church. 
   Mr. President, I applaud Dr. Hendricks on an extraordinary career in education. The key to his success has been nothing more than a strong desire to see his Department and his students succeed to the utmost of their potential. Because of this desire, the Northern Michigan University Education Department not only has a profound impact on the quality of education offered to students in the Upper Peninsula, but throughout the entire State of Michigan. On behalf of the United States Senate, I thank Dr. James Hendricks for the many beneficial things he accomplished during his career, and wish him the best of luck in retirement.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on the morning of November 11, 1975, the Mariners' Church of Detroit sat empty save for its Reverend, Richard Ingalls, who prayed alone in the sanctuary, ringing the church bell 29 times as he did so. Rev. Ingalls rang the bell in tribute to the crew of the Edmund Fitzgerald, who had lost their lives the previous evening when the legendary ship sank during one of the fiercest storms Lake Superior has ever produced. November 10, 2000, marks the 25th Anniversary of this tragic event, and I rise today not only in recognition of this anniversary, but also in memory and in honor of those 29 brave men, as well as the thousands of other mariners who have lost their lives on the Great Lakes. 
   Mr. President, few states have as rich or as successful a maritime tradition as does the State of Michigan. Michiganians initiated the iron ore trade 150 years ago, and men and women of the State continue to be leaders in Great Lakes trade. Virtually every region in the Nation benefits from this shipping. More than 70 percent of the Nation's steelmaking capacity is located in the Great Lakes basin. Coal from as far away as Montana and Wyoming moves across the Lakes on a daily basis. This year alone, ships bearing the United States flag will haul more than 125 million tons of cargo across the Great Lakes. 
   Amidst this success, it is unfortunately all too easy to overlook the tragic losses that have occurred throughout the maritime history of the Great Lakes. Over 6,000 shipwrecks have occurred on the Great Lakes, and over 30,000 lives have been lost. Many of these shipwrecks have occurred in November, the Month of Storms on the Great Lakes. In November of 1913, 12 ships were lost and 254 people killed during the Great Storm. In November of 1958, 33 men died when the Carl D. Bradley sank on Lake Michigan. And in November of 1966, the Daniel J. Morrell sank in Lake Huron, killing 28 members of her crew. 
   The wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald, though, remains the most remembered tragedy in Great Lakes maritime lore. Built in River Rouge, Michigan in 1957 and 1958, the Edmund Fitzgerald, at 729 feet long, was the largest ship on the Great Lakes until 1971. She was nicknamed ``The Pride of the American Side,'' and was the first ship to carry one million tons of ore through the Soo Locks in one year. The Edmund Fitzgerald also set the record for a single trip tonnage, carrying over 27 tons of ore on one excursion. Unfortunately, the ship is best remembered for what happened to her on the night of November 10, 1975. 
   This is in part because it remains unclear precisely what forces caused the Edmund Fitzgerald to sink that evening. The boat departed from Superior, Wisconsin, headed for Detroit, on the afternoon of November 9th, and was joined shortly thereafter by the Arthur M. Anderson. The two boats quickly ran into wicked seas, and Captain McSorley of the Edmund Fitzgerald and Captain Cooper of the Arthur M. Anderson agreed to take the northerly  course, where they would be protected by the highlands of the Canadian shore, across Lake Superior. 
   By the morning of November 10th, gale warnings had been increased to storm warnings, and by early evening the two boats were facing 25-30 foot waves, brought about by nearly 100 mile per hour winds. The Edmund Fitzgerald experienced difficulties throughout the day, and in a communication with Cpt. Cooper, Cpt. McSorley reported that he had ``a fence rail down, two vents lost or damaged, and a list.'' The two captains agreed to seek protection and safety in Whitefish Bay, located just off the coast of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. At 7:10 p.m., as the ships neared Whitefish Point, Cpt. McSorley, in a conversation with Cpt. Cooper, said this of he and his crew: ``We are holding our own.'' Approximately five minutes later, for reasons still unknown, the Edmund Fitzgerald, without so much as a cry for help, sank to the floor of Lake Superior. She remains there today, 535 feet below the surface of the great lake, and only 17 miles from the relative safety of Whitefish Point. 
   Mr. President, proper closure does not exist in a situation like that of the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald. The event lingers on not only in the memories of the families of crew members but in the memories of all Michiganians. In recognition of the 25th Anniversary of the sinking, the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum at Whitefish Point will hold a ceremony during which the ship's original bell, recovered on July 4, 1995, will be rung 29 times for each member of her crew, and a 30th time for the many other men and women who have lost their lives on the Great Lakes. And, on November 12, 2000, for the 25th time, the Rev. Ingalls will ring the bell of the Mariners' Church of Detroit in tribute to the men of the Edmund Fitzgerald. 
   What this clearly illustrates, Mr. President, is that the spirit of these men still lives on in Michiganians, and particularly in those involved in the maritime industry. Perhaps, then, in a situation where closure is so difficult to find, recognition, at least to some degree, can be an adequate substitute. To know that the lives of these men have not been forgotten but are still cherished, lives unfortunately cut short but with spirits that remain, spirits that continue to live on in all of our lives.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, during the 106th Congress, the Detroit Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation lost two of its most dedicated agents to battles with cancer. Both were respected not only for their professional accomplishments, but also for the manner in which they conducted themselves outside of their work, as each contributed considerably  to the Detroit community. I rise today in honor and in memory of Special Agent Tom Lapish, one of these two men. 
   Special Agent Lapish entered on duty with the FBI in 1976. After a brief stay in Kansas City, he was assigned to the Detroit Field Office. In Detroit, he developed an expertise in white collar crime investigations, and was regarded as one of the Bureau's top agents in that arena. With a background in accounting, he thrived on the protracted, intricate nature of investigating complex fraud matters, and was formally commended for his investigative accomplishments on several occasions. 
   Not surprisingly, Special Agent Lapish was known for his attention to detail. He was also known for his high ethical standards. He stood for the ideals of the FBI motto--Fidelity, Bravery and Integrity--at all times. Even as his illness made him weak, he would contemplate going to the office to work on cases he had been assigned. In addition, he was very active within his church, helping to promote the Christian lifestyle which he believed so deeply in. 
   Special Agent Lapish was also an extremely gifted athlete, and his passion for soccer became legendary within the Detroit community. He served as the coach for nearly 30 soccer teams, and in this capacity mentored hundreds of young individuals. His impact on them was seen at his memorial service, which was crowded with soccer players paying final respects to their favorite coach. It can also physically be seen in the Detroit area, where a soccer field was posthumously named in his honor. 
   Special Agent Lapish passed away on May 18, 2000 at the age of 50. He is survived by his wife, Mary, and two sons, Matthew and Andrew. 
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation works hard to ensure that its agents set a strong moral example for the people they are entrusted to protect. There is no question that Special Agent Lapish was a leader in this regard. Dedicated to his Nation, his agency, his family and his faith, he was a role model in the Detroit community, and he will be deeply missed.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, during the 106th Congress, the Detroit Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation lost two of its most dedicated agents to battles with cancer. Both were respected not only for their professional accomplishments, but also for the manner in which they conducted themselves outside of their work, as each contributed considerably to the Detroit community. I rise today in honor and in memory of Special Agent David J. Wilson, one of these two men. 
   Before joining the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1980, Special Agent Wilson served the Nation as a military police officer, earning the National Defense, Marksman and Sharpshooter service medals. Upon joining the FBI, he quickly earned top honors in his Academy Class for academics, physical fitness and marksmanship. 
   Special Agent Wilson spent the majority of his FBI career working in Detroit. He specialized in drug and white collar crime matters, and was highly regarded for his investigative skills. Indeed, he was a pioneer in the investigation of health care fraud, and his undercover work in the Detroit area yielded numerous successful prosecutions which saved and recovered millions of dollars for the State of Michigan in fraudulent medical billings. They also helped to prevent the illegal diversion of controlled substances by health care professionals. 
   Special Agent Wilson received many commendations, including two national awards, on account of his investigative prowess. In 1997, he was appointed to the position of Polygrapher for the Detroit Field Office, a position he held with great pride. 
   The City of Detroit was in many ways a perfect fit for Special Agent Wilson. He developed a unique interest in its history and architecture. An accomplished vocalist himself, he had a passion for music, and particularly for the ``Motown'' sound. He also had an  appreciation for fine arts and for the theater, both of which were nurtured in Detroit. And, as an avid basketball player and fan, he was able to cheer on the Detroit Pistons during the greatest years that organization has known. 
   Special Agent Wilson passed away on August 29, 1999 at the age of 47. He is survived by his wife, Patricia, and two sons, Lerone and Paul. 
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation works hard to ensure that its agents set a strong moral example for the people they are entrusted to protect. There is no question that Special Agent Wilson was a leader in this regard. Dedicated to his Nation, his agency and his family, he was a role model in the Detroit community, and he will be deeply missed.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, November 11, 2000 is a very special day on the campus of Central Michigan University in Mount Pleasant, MI. The day has been proclaimed Mr. Leonard E. and Mrs. Louise A. Plachta Day, in honor of the former President and First Lady of the University. I rise today to recognize this occasion and to pay tribute to the magnificent couple being honored. 
   The couple arrived in Mt. Pleasant in 1972 when Mr. Plachta took a job as Professor of Accounting. He served as Assistant Dean of CMU's College of Business Administration from 1977 to 1979, when he took over the position of Dean. In January of 1992, he was appointed to serve as President of the University, and he served in this position until his retirement in July of 2000. 
   Mr. Plachta's 8-year tenure as President stands as one of the most productive stints in the history of the University. His financial restructuring of CMU has allowed it to remain one of the most affordable public universities in the State of Michigan. He initiated a number of programs to give students real-world experience to help prepare them for future employment, including developing a state-of-the-art Career Services Center and expanding internship opportunities for students. 
   He drew national attention for the Degree Partners Program, which is a guaranteed four-year degree agreement with students designed to save them money as well as get skilled professionals into the job market quickly. He also initiated one of the first leadership scholar programs in the country, a four-year educational protocol designed to help students develop ethical leadership skills they can apply in their professions. 
   Mr. Plachta oversaw significant upgrading of classrooms and facilities during his tenure. This included new, highly technological music and science buildings; new and renovated athletic facilities; and a pending Library and Information Services Center that will incorporate technology to link students with academic resources from around the world. 
   He also oversaw a complete reorganization of CMU's academic programs in order to increase interdepartmental cooperation and draw attention to the University's strengths. This reorganization included a new College of Communication and Fine Arts, a new College of Health Professions, redefined science programs through a new College of Science and Technology, and a revamped College of Business Administration, College of Education and Human Services, and College of Humanities and Social and Behavioral Sciences. 
   One of the greatest accomplishments of his tenure, though, has been the leadership role CMU has taken in terms of the chartering of public school academies, charter schools. More than 17,000 K-12 students, approximately 50 percent of whom are minorities or at risk children, are enrolled in 59 CMU-licensed schools throughout the State of Michigan, with families on waiting lists at nearly every school. In addition, the national Charter Schools Development and Performance Institute, housed at CMU, had its grand opening earlier this year, on May 1, 2000. 
   Mrs. Plachta has also greatly contributed to the CMU community. For twelve years, she worked as a member of the clerical staff. She provided superior guidance and caring support to nontraditional students as the nontraditional student services liaison, which is a volunteer position. Her knowledge in this position came honestly, as she earned a master's degree herself as a nontraditional student. And, as First Lady, she has been a much-loved ambassador for CMU and an outstanding member of the Mount Pleasant community, volunteering with numerous organizations and strongly supporting adult literacy programs. 
   Central Michigan University stands where it does today, poised for success in the 21st Century, in large part due to the efforts of Mr. and Mrs. Plachta. They have worked together to bring  about positive change not only for the University, but also for the State of Michigan, on many different fronts, and I thank them for their extraordinary efforts. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Mr. Leonard E. and Louise A. Plachta on having a day designated in their honor, and I hope that they enjoy every minute of it.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to explain my vote against the Boxer amendment No. 4308 to the FY01 VA/HUD Appropriations bill. 
   This amendment addressed two issues which are very important to Michiganians: clean air and clean water. Unfortunately, whatever the intentions of the author, the amendment would have done more harm than good. I particular, I was troubled by the attempt to strike language which will prevent the EPA from designating Michigan counties as being in nonattainment, or not meeting clear air requirements. 
   On May 14, 1999, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in American Trucking Association v USEPA, ruled that the 8-hour ozone standard as proposed by EPA be remanded to EPA for further consideration. The 8-hour standard was therefore suspended. The court specifically noted that USEPA retains the power to designate areas as nonattainment under a revised national Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), however, there must be a legal standard in place before USEPA makes such designations. Since the 8-hour standard was remanded, it is not legal NAAQS. 
   In response, EPA announced its intention to reinstate applicability of the one-hour ozone standard. However, in determining which communities were in nonattainment under the one-hour standard, EPA intended to make air quality designations based on the designations of these areas at the time the 1-hour standard was originally revoked, rather than rely on the most recent air quality data. 
   Under this proposed action, six Michigan counties would have been in nonattainment even though all six have monitoring data measuring attainment--Midland, Bay, Saginaw, Genesee, Muskegon, and Allegan. These are counties that were previously designated as nonattainment of the 1-hour standard. Although they were previously designated as nonattainment, only Muskegon was ``classified'' under the classification scheme of the Clean Air Act. Thus, only Muskegon County was subject to the major ozone control programs, but all nonattainment counties are subject to tougher permit and offset requirements. 
   Even though these counties are now in attainment, tougher permit standards would have been required for new major stationary sources just because these counties were previously designated as nonattainment for the 1-hour standard. Additionally, offset requirements for major stationary sources would have applied. In addition, these six counties would have had to resume doing transportation and general conformity for projects receiving federal funds. Under the revocation, conformity was not a requirement. Conformity was a continuing requirement for redesignated areas. 
   Shortly after the announcement, I made clear to USEPA that in my opinion there was no rational basis for intentionally jeopardizing economic development and the construction of much-needed road projects in areas that are meeting attainment levels for the 1-hour ozone standard. Further, I noted that EPA should not disregard air quality improvements made in several areas of the state and should base any non-attainment designations under this rulemaking on the most current air quality monitoring data available. 
   To date, I have not been satisfied with the response from USEPA and for that reason, I supported the language included in the FY01 VA/HUD Appropriations bill. This language will prevent EPA from designating any Michigan county as nonattainment for the next 12 months or until the courts have settled the pending matter, whichever happens first. In fact, I understand that EPA actually agreed to this language in a compromise with the house. 
   It was unfortunate that the Boxer amendment also sought to permit EPA to move forward on a new arsenic standard. This is an issue which I believe merits independent consideration. I understand the arsenic standard has not been updated in almost 60 years. However, I am concerned that the push to lower the standard to 5ppb from the current 50ppb may be too extreme. While large water systems may be able to comply with such a strict requirement, I am not at all certain that smaller systems which serve a great percentage of the Michigan population would be able to comply with that standard. They would therefore be subject to penalties for their inability to comply with yet another unfunded mandate. In any event, I look forward to the opportunity to consider this issue on its own merit, and urge the EPA to base whatever standard it eventually proposes on sound science and even then only after extensive peer review.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in 1982, the United States Department of Education initiated its Blue Ribbon Schools Program. In each year since, the Department has recognized schools throughout the country which excel in all areas of academic leadership, teaching and teacher development, and school curriculum. In other words, Blue Ribbon Schools are the finest public and private secondary schools our Nation has to offer. They are the schools that set the standard for which others strive. I am very proud to report that nine of the 198 Blue Ribbon Schools named by Secretary Richard W. Riley for 1999-2000 are located in the State of Michigan, and I rise today to recognize Donald L. Bemis Junior High School in Sterling Heights, Michigan, one of these nine schools. 
   The mission of Donald L. Bemis Junior High is to educate its students in the development of knowledge, problem solving, and acceptance of others. Curriculum places primary emphasis on basic skills to promote essential knowledge and challenge students to achieve at the highest levels they are capable of attaining. Students are taught tolerance as conflict resolution strategies have been integrated into this curriculum. In addition, character building is taught and modeled within the school climate. The whole of this curriculum is designed to provide students with the building blocks they need to construct positive ideals which they can carry with them for the rest of their lives. 
   Technology has recently begun to play a large role in the program as well. Each classroom at Bemis is equipped with a television and VCR, allowing students to be a part of a worldwide telecommunications system and providing teachers with audio-visual communication throughout the entire school. There are at least two computers in each classroom, which are hooked up to two building servers as well as the Internet. Bemis also has three computer laboratories, from which teachers and students can easily access personal files which have been set up for them. There is no doubt that technology is revolutionizing the way that students are taught throughout our Nation. There is also no doubt that Bemis Junior High has been on the forefront of employing it for positive purposes. 
   Perhaps the greatest key to the success of Bemis Junior High though has been the collaborative decision making process which has been developed by parents, teachers and students. This process involved an overall dedication to the Bemis Junior High community, and relies upon keeping lines of communication open through parental contacts, open houses, parent-teacher conferences, the Parent Sounding Board, and the Student Council. Also present and a part of this process is the School Improvement Team, made up of staff and students focusing upon issues to enhance student achievement. All of these efforts lead to a well informed school community, which has been the most important aspect in the development of Bemis Junior High. 
   Mr. President, I applaud the students, parents, faculty and administration of Bemis Junior High, for I believe this is an award which speaks more to the effort of a united community than it does to the work of a few individuals. With that having been said, I would like to recognize Mrs. Joyce A. Spade, Principal of Bemis Junior High, whose dedication to making her school one of  the finest in our Nation has been instrumental in creating this community. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Donald L. Bemis Junior High School on being named a Blue Ribbon School for 1999-2000, and wish the school continued success in the future.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in 1982, the United States Department of Education initiated its Blue Ribbon Schools Program. In each year since, the Department has recognized schools throughout the country which excel in all areas of academic leadership, teaching and teacher development, and school curriculum. In other words, Blue Ribbon Schools are recognized because they are the finest public and private secondary schools our Nation has to offer. They are the schools that set the standard for which others strive. I am very proud to report that nine of the 198 blue Ribbon Schools names by Secretary Richard W. Riley for 1999-2000 are located in the State of Michigan, and I rise today to recognize Adlai E. Stevenson High School in Sterling Heights, Michigan, one of these nine schools. 
   The mission of Stevenson High School is to provide every student with a positive learning environment, which will allow them to feel a part of a school community while at the same time achieving their greatest potential as responsible and contributing members of society. This mission is reflected in Stevenson's motto, ``School of Champions,'' symbolizing the importance that the faculty and administration place on developing champions in all aspects of life. Students are treated with dignity and with respect, as faculty view this as the most effective method to help them achieve excellence in school and in life of which they are capable. 
   Indeed, the commitment of the faculty and administration towards making their school achieve to the highest level has been the most important key in it actually achieving at this level. 85 percent of the 94 professional staff members hold masters, specialist or doctorate degrees. All staff serve on one of four target-goal committees, which is only one example among many of how the faculty and administration work cooperatively to facilitate both teaching and learning. They also take an active role in curriculum development, from researching new textbooks and other classroom materials to serving on curriculum committees at the district level. The faculty and administration recently witnessed the success of their efforts, as Stevenson High School recently completed its five-year journey to achieve North Central Outcome-Based Accreditation. 
   The administration at Stevenson High School has also made a concerted effort to ensure that their school is as safe as possible. There is zero tolerance regarding weapons, violence, threats of violence and the use of alcohol or other drugs. A building security plan is in place and practiced on a regular basis, and an evacuation plan is in place to safeguard students and staff in an emergency or crisis. In addition, a support network has been established at Stevenson High School so effective that students trust the administration and faculty enough to forewarn them of potential problems. This is due to the success of student organizations such as the Students Offering Services Club, the Renaissance Club, the Cultural Diversity Council and the Peer Mediation Program. Because of these support groups, students feel connected to the school and to each other, and know that they are valued as individuals. 
   Mr. President, I applaud the students, parents, faculty and administration of Stevenson High School, for I believe this is an award which speaks more to the effort of a united community that it does to the work of a few individuals. With that having been said, I would like to recognize Mr. Donald R. Nawrocki, the Principal of Stevenson High School, whose dedication to making his school one of the finest in our Nation has been instrumental in creating this community. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Adlai E. Stevenson High School on being named a Blue Ribbon School for 1999-2000, and wish the school continued success in the future.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Victims of Rape Health Protection Act. This legislation would facilitate health treatment of rape victims by empowering victims with the ability to determine at an early date whether or not their attacker carried the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. 
   Mr. President, in addition to a rape survivor being forced to live with the horrific elements commonly associated with the act of rape, rape victims simultaneously are threatened by yet another cruel aggressor, the HIV disease. Current medical technology is limited in its ability to detect HIV in the body during the initial stages of infection; as such, if the victim must rely on self-testing alone, the presence of HIV may not be evident for months. 
   Reports from both the American Medical Association and a study published in the April, 1997, New England Journal of Medicine outline the merits of early action in the fight against HIV. As immediate and intensive administration anti-HIV drugs has been shown to greatly reduce the risk of HIV infection, early knowledge of whether or not a victim has been exposed to the virus is imperative to embarking on critical, potentially life-saving courses of medication. 
   Mr. President, ten years ago Congress passed a law that allowed rape victims to compel testing of their attacker upon conviction. Over the years medical science has made important advancements in the fight against AIDS, and it is time for the law to follow suit. Today, I wish to challenge the current inadequate policies which exist in some states, and allow victims of rape early access to their assailants' HIV screen results. 
   Where there is any risk of transmission of the virus, this legislation would require states to actively screen rape defendants for HIV and disclose the results to the victim within forty-eight hours of an indictment or information. Beyond notification of the victim, test result confidentiality would be determined by the individual states as they see necessary to protect the privacy of their citizens. Federal Byrne Grant funding would be made available to the states in order to help pay for the testing; states which refuse to operate in compliance with these testing requirements would be subject to a ten-percent reduction of their Byrne Grant funds. 
   Mr. President, I have read far too many stomach-churning accounts of both female and male rape victims, at every age, where early knowledge of a sex offender's HIV status--positive or negative--may have spared the victim unnecessary mental anguish, or possibly, may have spared the victim's life. At this time, I would like to share a few of these sad stories with my colleagues. 
   In the summer of 1996, a seven year old girl was brutally raped by a 57 year old man. The little girl and her five year old brother had been lured to a secluded, abandoned building in the East New York section of Brooklyn. The man raped and sodomized the girl. Her brother, meanwhile, was beaten, tied up and forced to witness his sister's rape. After the man's arrest, the defendant refused to be tested for HIV. His refusal was permitted by the state's laws. The man latter told the police he was infected with HIV. 
   In New Jersey, three boys gang-raped a 10 year-old mentally-retarded girl. The girl's family demanded that the boys be tested for HIV; these requests were denied. Three years after the girl was raped and the boys were convicted, the family was still fighting to learn the HIV status of the rapists.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr. Donald W. Jensen, who is retiring on January 1, 2001, after 13 years of service as a member of the Oakland County Board of Commissioners. Since 1987, Commissioner Jensen has represented the citizens of District 15 to the best of his ability, which has been in an exemplary manner. 
   Commissioner Jensen graduated from the University of Detroit with a degree in Business Administration. He spent much of his work career with Burroughs Corporation, where he served as Director of Advertising and Public Relations. His primary responsibility was the design and production of promotional and technical literature, though he was also responsible for media advertising, the public relations department, and the operation of their international literature distribution facility. While at Burroughs, Mr. Jensen was a Board Member and President of the National Trade Show Exhibitors Association. 
   Public service has always played an essential role in Commissioner Jensen's life. Prior to being elected to his current position, he served for nine years as a member of the Birmingham, Michigan, City Commission and then later as Mayor of Birmingham. He was a Founder and Board Member of the Foundation for Birmingham Senior Residents, an organization which enables seniors to remain in their homes. He has also served on the Board of numerous other organizations, including the American Cancer Society and the Center for Independent Living. 
   As a County Commissioner representing the Cities of Berkley and Birmingham and a portion of the City of Royal Oak, Mr. Jensen has served as Chairman of the General Government Committee from 1993-94, as Vice Chairman of the Finance Committee, and has been a member of the Oakland Livingston Human Service Agency, the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments, the Oakland County Board of Commissioners' Public Services Committee, and the Health and Human Services Committee. He has also been a Trustee of the County Library Board for 12 years, and served on the Taxation and Finance Committee of the National Association of Counties. 
   I would like to thank Commissioner Jensen for his dedication and many efforts throughout his career in public service. His leadership during this time has been exceptional and will be dearly missed. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Mr. Donald W. Jensen on a wonderful and successful career, and wish him the best of luck in retirement.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr. George W. Kuhn, who is retiring this year after a 60-year career during which he split time between the United States Navy, the Ford Motor Company, and being a public servant. Whatever the forum, he has been a leader and an inspiration to those around him. 
   Mr. Kuhn graduated from Central Michigan University, majoring in business administration, economics, and political science. In 1943, he entered the Naval Service and served aboard the Tender U.S.S. Pelias as a Finance Officer. He returned to active duty during the Korean War and served at U.S. Naval Stations in New York and in the Panama Canal Zone. Ultimately, he retired as a Navy Captain after completing 39 years of service, both on active duty and in the Naval Reserves. 
   Following the Korean War, Mr. Kuhn completed Ford Motor Company's Management Training Program. He served on the staff of the Vice President of Product Development for 20 years, coordinating the development phases of styling, engineering, purchasing and manufacturing of future car programs. 
   Mr. Kuhn's passion has always been in public service, though. He has been a leader within the Oakland County Republican Party for nearly 50 years, since his involvement in Eisenhower's first presidential campaign. In 1959, he was elected Mayor of the City of Berkley, Michigan. He served as Mayor until being elected to serve as a State Senator in 1966. During his four year tenure in the Michigan State Senate, he served as Chairman of the Corporations and Banking Committee, Chairman of the Senate Municipalities and Election Committee, and as Senate Majority Whip in 1970. In November of 1972, he was elected Oakland County Drain Commissioner, and he has served admirably in this position for the past 28 years, making him the longest active member of the Oakland County Parks and Recreation Commission. 
   Mr. Kuhn has often been recognized for his efforts. He has received the Ford Outstanding Citizen of the Year Award, the Distinguished Alumni Award at the 75th Anniversary of Central Michigan University, he has been honored by the Michigan Associated Underground Contractors, Inc., in appreciation of his contributions to the underground construction industry, and is a recent recipient of the Oakland County's annual Quality People, Quality County (Q2) Award which recognizes outstanding service to the community. 
   I applaud Mr. Kuhn on his extraordinary service to Oakland County, the State of Michigan, and our Nation. His leadership in all phases of his 60 year career has been exceptional and will be dearly missed. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate and thank Mr. George W. Kuhn on a wonderful and successful career, and wish him the best of luck in retirement.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Honorable Gus Cifelli, who will retire later this year from a career which has included a Purple Heart, a world championship, and nearly 30 years of exemplary service as a District Court Judge in the State of Michigan. Throughout each phase of this career, he has been a leader and an inspiration to those around him. 
   During World War II, Judge Cifelli served in the United States Marine Corps in the Pacific theater of operations, and was awarded the Purple Heart for bravery. Upon returning home, he attended school at the University of Notre Dame, where he played tackle for four undefeated football teams. Following graduation, he played professional football, and was a member of the 1952 World Champion Detroit Lions, the Green Bay Packers, the Philadelphia Eagles and the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
   Following his professional football career, Judge Cifelli worked as a casualty insurance agent and investigator and a labor relations representative for the Ford Motor Company. In 1972, the citizens of the State of Michigan's 48th District elected him to serve as their District Court Judge. 
   During his time on the bench, Mr. Cifelli has been credited with initiating and implementing the Court's small claims mediation procedures, staffed by volunteer attorneys. He has also created the Volunteer in Probation Program, which involves citizens as probation officers, and been responsible for the establishment of many procedures and standards for the Court's operation. To say the least, he has indelibly left his mark upon the 48th Circuit Court. 
   Judge Cifelli is a member of the American and Michigan Bar Associations, the American Judges' Association, the Justinian Society of Jurists and the American Judicature Society. He is also a member of the Italian American Foundation, the Oakland County Association for Retarded Citizens, and is a former board member of Families in Transition and the Jewish Association for Residential Care. 
   Judge Cifelli has often been recognized for his efforts. In 1994, he was named Italian American Man of the Year. In 1997, he was the recipient of the Eleanor Roosevelt Humanitarian Award from the State of Israel Bonds. And in 1998, he received the Law Enforcement Award. 
   I would like to thank Judge Cifelli for a lifetime of extraordinary achievement. Wherever he has gone, he has stood as a role model within the community, and his leadership will be dearly missed. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate the Honorable Gus Cifelli on a wonderful and successful career, and wish him the best of luck in retirement.

In other words, Blue Ribbon Schools are recognized because they are the finest public and private secondary schools our Nation has to offer.

Riley for 1999-2000 are located in the State of Michigan, and I rise today to recognize Glenn W. Levey Middle School in Southfield, Michigan, one of these nine schools. 
   Glenn W. Levey Middle School takes pride in its tradition of addressing the learning needs of the whole child at a crucial stage in his or her development. The staff is firmly commited to educating all students through a challenging curriculum, a strong academic program, and a collaborative professional development program. This program takes into account the multiple needs of a middle-school population, needs which Levey has long worked to meet. 
   Levey was one of the first schools in the district to implement interdisciplinary teaming, block scheduling, and to align its curriculum with state and national standards. It is one of a select group of schools in the United States to successfully implement an IMAST (Integrated Mathematics, Science and Technology) Program. As a result of its success in these areas, Levey was one of the first schools in its district to acquire North Central Accreditation, NCA, receiving the highest scores in every NCA category.  
   The staff and students of Levey Middle School are proud of its history as a leading middle school, and the fact that it has been a catalyst for change inside the district and beyond. The staff and the community continue to set higher standards and hold greater expectations. With supportive parents, hardworking students, and a skilled and dedicated staff, I am confident that Levey Middle School will continue to set the precedent for years to come. 
   I applaud the students, parents, faculty and administration of Glenn W. Levey Middle School, for I believe this is an award which speaks more to the effort of a united community than it does to the work of a few individuals. With that having been said, I would like to recognize Dr. Linda Paramore-Ford, the Principal of Glenn W. Levey Middle School, whose dedication to making her school one of the finest in our Nation has been instrumental in creating this community. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Glenn W. Levey Middle School on being named a Blue Ribbon School for 1999-2000, and wish the school continued success in the future.

In other words, Blue Ribbon Schools are recognized because they are the finest public and private secondary schools our Nation has to offer. They are the schools that set the standard for which others strive. I am very proud to report that nine of the 198 Blue Ribbon Schools named by Secretary Richard W. Riley for 1999-2000 are located in the State of Michigan, and I rise today to recognize Lake Orion High School in Lake Orion, Michigan, one of these nine schools. 
   In fall of 1992, Lake Orion High School set about to create school improvement that was purposeful to the lives of teachers and students. Their goals included a desire to maintain high academic standards, engage the learner, relieve stress, facilitate networking, expand curricular opportunities, curb attendance problems, and raise the responsibility of the student for his or her own learning. Ultimately, the mission was to reach the students of today and help them become the leaders of tomorrow. 
   All this required an enormous amount of time and extensive research. First, a staff committee devised a minimum restructuring of their normal six period days by allotting three hours on Wednesday morning for professional development, a program which was implemented in the fall of 1994. In February of 1994, the Vision of Hope staff committee was formed to investigate the restructuring of the school day. Extensive research, visitations, debate and discussion followed and, in the fall of 1996, a 4 by 4 block schedule was adopted. The block system has resulted in better teacher cooperation, greater flexibility in scheduling, increased student choices and a more meaningful and relevant curriculum for Lake Orion High School students. 
   Lake Orion High School moved into a new building in the fall of 1997, a state of the art facility which has become an ideal setting for the many innovative changes that have become a part of the curriculum. More importantly, the new building stands as the perfect representation of the overall growth that has occurred at Lake Orion High since the fall of 1992, growth which is a tribute to the shared goals and shared vision that administration and faculty together committed themselves to eight years ago. 
   I applaud the students, parents, faculty and administration of Lake Orion High School, for I believe this is an award which speaks more to the effort of a united community than it does to the work of a few individuals. With that having been said, I would like to recognize Dr. John S. Kastran, the Principal of Lake Orion High School, whose dedication to making his school one of the finest in our Nation has been instrumental in creating this community. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Lake Orion High School on being named a Blue Ribbon School for 1999-2000, and wish the school continued success in the future.

Riley for 1999-2000 are located in the State of Michigan, and I rise today to recognize L'Anse Creuse Middle School - North in Macomb, Michigan, one of these nine schools. 
   The mission of L'Anse Creuse Middle School--North, MSN, is for each student, with the support of staff, parents and the community, to ``attain measurable growth intellectually, physically, and socially in a safe, positive environment.'' Being recognized as a Blue Ribbon School is a tribute to the success that MSN has achieved in this regard. 
   Increased staffing, thoughtful scheduling and a dedicated staff have been the primary keys to this success. They have also been the keys to MSN completely ``teaming'' its students, the only school in its district to have done so. Teachers also work as parts of instructional teams--most academic teachers have been teammates for at least three years. This fact illustrates one of the greatest strengths of the school, which is the high level of cooperation that exists between members of the faculty, cooperation which in turn facilitates student learning. 
   The administration and faculty at MSN quickly realized the advantages that technology offered to their new learning program and made a strong commitment to improving the ability of their students to access computers. Indeed, this commitment to technology has revolutionized the teaching process and the management of the school. Two computer laboratories are now available to staff and students. Students can also sign out laptop computers for overnight use to help them with their homework. In addition, telephones have been placed in each classroom, which allow teachers to better communicate with parents and school offices, as well as with one another. 
   The administration and faculty of MSN recognize that a truly successful middle school is one that takes elementary school students and prepares them to succeed in the adult world of high school. Their philosophy is represented in this statement from the book The Middle School--and Beyond: ``High quality middle schools result from the creative balance between elementary and secondary perspectives, between specialization and generalization, between curriculum and community, between equity and excellence, between teaching the mind and touching the heart.'' This is the core belief of all MSN faculty and administration, and the programs they have adopted, which have been so successful, reflect their commitment to this belief. 
   I applaud the students, parents, faculty and administration of MSN, for I believe this is an award which speaks more to the effort of a united community than it does to the work of a few individuals. With that having been said, I would like to recognize Mr. Erick Alsup, the Principal of MSN, whose dedication to making his school one of the finest in our Nation has been instrumental in creating this community. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate L'Anse Creuse Middle School--North on being named a Blue Ribbon School for 1999-2000, and wish the school continued success in the future.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Honorable  Roman S. Gribbs, who will retire this year after a long and successful career of service to the State of Michigan. As Sheriff of Wayne County, Mayor of Detroit, and, for the last 18 years, a judge on the State of Michigan Court of Appeals, Judge Gribbs has been a statewide leader for over 30 years, and he has led with a strong and fair hand. 
   Judge Gribbs was born on December 29, 1925. After graduating from Capac High School in the Michigan Thumb area, he enlisted in the United States Army, from which he received an honorable discharge in 1948, having attained the rank of Sergeant. In 1952, he graduated Magna Cum Laude from the University of Detroit with a degree in Economics and Accounting, and in 1954 he graduated from the University of Detroit Law School with a Juris Doctor degree. 
   Following graduation, Judge Gribbs remained at the University of Detroit Law School for two years as an instructor. He then spent two years as Assistant Wayne County Prosecutor before moving into private practice with the firm of Shaheen, Gribbs and Shaheen. In 1966, he was named Presiding Traffic Court Referee for the City of Detroit, and in June of 1968 he was appointed Sheriff of Wayne County. 
   In November of 1970, Judge Gribbs was elected Mayor of the City of Detroit. In his four years as Mayor, he became known not only as a solid leader, but a solid man, who was willing to work with individuals from both sides of the aisle to get things done. He played a large role in helping the city put the unruliness of the late 1960's behind it, and once again begin to move in a forward direction. During this time, he also served as President of the National League of Cities, a fact which illustrates that his leadership capabilities were well recognized by his colleagues. 
   Following his term as Mayor, Judge Gribbs briefly returned to private practice before being appointed to serve as a Judge for the Third Judicial Court in 1976. In 1982, he was elected to the State of Michigan Court of Appeals, and he has served in this position ever since. Judge Gribbs brings to the bench a keen understanding of the law. More importantly, he carries with him an approach to its application that is deeply rooted in common sense. He makes many difficult decisions each year, and he makes these decisions with his first and foremost priority being to find a just solution to the problem at hand. It is for this reason that he has become a well respected Jurist. 
   Judge Gribbs is a member of numerous organizations, which will allow him to remain an active member of society following his retirement. These include the Michigan Judicial Institute, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Michigan Judges' Association, and the Friends of the Archbishop of Detroit. He has also been very active in the Boy Scouts of America, the American Judicature Society, the Family Conciliation Court, the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice, the Michigan Youth Commission, the World Trade Club of Detroit and the Slavic American National Foundation. In addition, he is presently on the Board of Directors of the Thomas M. Cooley Law School, the Public Administration Foundation and the Northville Township Community Foundation. 
   Mr. President, Judge Gribbs' contributions to the City of Detroit and the State of Michigan are truly immeasurable. I would like to thank him for his dedication and his many efforts throughout his career. His leadership during this time has been exceptional, and it will be dearly missed by the State of Michigan. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate the Honorable Roman S. Gribbs on a wonderful and successful career, and wish him the best of luck in retirement.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. I rise to express my strong support for this conference report. It contains two very important measures: the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, aimed at combating the scourge of sex trafficking, and the Violence Against Women Act of 2000, aimed at reauthorizing and improving on federal programs and other measures designed to assist in the fight against domestic violence. 
   I would first of all like to extend my compliments to Senator BROWNBACK, Congressman SMITH, Senator WELLSTONE, Senator HELMS, Senator HATCH, and others, including their staff, who worked so hard on the trafficking portion of this legislation. The problem of international sex trafficking that they have tackled is a particularly ugly one, and I commend them for all the work they have invested in devising effective means to address it. 
   I would like to concentrate my own remarks on the second half of this legislation, the Violence Against Women Act of 2000. I was proud to be an original cosponsor of the Senate version of this bill, and I am very pleased to see that the efforts of everyone involved are about to become law. 
   The 1994 Violence Against Women Act has been crucial in reducing violence perpetrated against women and families across America. VAWA 1994 increased resources for training and law enforcement, and bolstered prosecution of child abuse, sexual assault, and domestic violence cases. States have changed the way they treat crimes of violence against women; 24 States and the District of Columbia now mandate arrest for most domestic violence offenses. 
   States have also relieved women of some of the costs associated with violence against them. For example, as a result of VAWA, all have some provision for covering the cost of a forensic rape exam. Most notably, VAWA 1994 provided much-needed support for shelters and crisis centers, funded rape prevention and education, and created a National Domestic Violence Hotline. 
   Nevertheless, much remains to be done. In Michigan alone, in 1998 we had more than 47,000 incidents of domestic violence, including 46 homicides. About 85 percent of the victims of those incidents were women. We must continue to do what we can to deter and prevent this kind of violence, and to make services available to its victims. 
   The legislation before us today continues the important work begun in 1994 by reauthorizing these important programs. And make no mistake about it, we must do so if we are to continue with the progress we have made. 
   In Michigan, for example, despite our much heightened awareness of the devastating 
   impact of sexual abuse, in many communities VAWA grants are the only source of funding for services for rape victims. I am told that this is true nationally as well. Forty-five shelters serving 83 counties receive funding from VAWA grants. Reauthorizing VAWA is critical so as to provide the assurance of continued congressional commitment needed to ensure that these services do not dry up. 
   That is why I am so delighted that this conference report is about to be enacted into law. I would especially like to note how pleased I am with the results the conference reached on a couple of particular provisions. 
   First, I would like to discuss the funding the bill provides for rape education, services to victims, and prevention. This critical funding is used for, among other things, helping survivors of rape and sexual assault come to terms with what has happened to them so that they are able to get on with their lives and also assist in the prosecution of the perpetrators of these crimes. It is also used to educate investigators and medical personnel on the best protocols to use to collect evidence in these cases. 
   I would like to give a few examples of instances of how this is working in Michigan. A 21-year-old single woman was raped. She became pregnant as a result of the rape. She decided that she wanted to carry the baby to term. She had to deal with her own very complex emotions about her pregnancy, her changed relationship with her boyfriend, and the enormous difficulties of raising a child as a single parent. The VAWA money for rape services funded the counseling to help her with this overwhelmingly difficult set of decisions and circumstances. 
   VAWA rape money also funded services for a 63-year-old woman who was sexually assaulted. With that help, she was able to come to terms with what had happened, and testify against the rapist. 
   To give just one more example: VAWA rape money is being used right  now to fund a new sexual assault nurse examining program. This program provides a sympathetic and expert place for survivors to go after they have been assaulted where they will be treated with respect and understanding and where the evidence will be collected correctly. 
   The reason I have come to know so much about this particular aspect of VAWA is that when my wife Jane met with the Michigan Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence in Oakland County on June 30 of this year, its director, Mary Keefe, indicated to her that while she was generally very pleased with the reauthorization legislation we were working on here in the Senate, the $50 million we were proposing for this particular aspect of VAWA, the rape education and prevention component, just wasn't enough. She indicated her hope that we would be able to raise that to the $80 million figure in the House bill. Jane passed that along to me, and once I understood how this money was used and was able to explain how important it was, with Senator HATCH's and Senator BIDEN's assistance, the Senate proposal was increased to $60 million. 
   I continued to follow this matter as the bill was progressing through conference. Yesterday I was delighted to be able to tell my staff to let Ms. Keefe know that the conference bill accommodates her request fully, and authorizes $80 million in funding for these grants for the next 5 years. One important purpose for which I am sure some of these funds will be used is educating our kids about relatively less well known drugs like GHB, the date rape drug that claimed the life of one of my constituents and was the subject of legislation I worked on earlier this Congress. 
   Second, I am pleased that the conference report contains the new Federal law against cyberstalking that I introduced a few months ago. As the Internet, with all its positives, has fast become an integral part of our personal and professional lives, it is regrettable but unsurprising that criminals are becoming adept at using the Internet as well. 
   Hence the relatively new crime of ``cyberstalking,'' in which a person uses the Internet to engage in a course of conduct designed to terrorize another. Stalking someone in this way can be more attractive to the perpetrator than doing it in person, since cyberstalkers can take advantage of the ease of the Internet and their relative anonymity online to be even more brazen in their threatening behavior than they might be in person. 
   Some jurisdictions are doing an outstanding job in cracking down on this kind of conduct. For example, in my own State, Oakland County Sheriff Michael J. Bouchard and Oakland County Prosecutor Dave Gorcyca have developed very impressive knowledge and expertise about how to pursue cyberstalkers. 
   This legislation will not supplant their efforts. It will, however, address cases that it is difficult for a single State to pursue on its own, those where the criminal is stalking a victim in another State. In such cases, where the criminal is deliberately using the means of interstate commerce to place his or her victim in reasonable fear of serious bodily injury, my bill will allow the Federal Government to prosecute that person. 
   The existence of a Federal law in this area should also help encourage local authorities who do not know where to start when confronted with a cyberstalking allegation to turn to Federal authorities for advice and assistance. There is little worse than the feeling of helplessness a person can get if he or she is being terrorized and just cannot get help from the police. Much of VAWA 2000 is aimed at helping the authorities that person turns to respond more effectively. That is a central function of the cyberstalking provisions as well. 
   Finally, I am very pleased that the conference report includes the core provisions from the Senate bill that I developed along with Senator KENNEDY, Senator HATCH, and Senator BIDEN to address ways in which our immigration laws remain susceptible of misuse by abusive spouses as a tool to blackmail and control the abuse victim. 
   This potential arises out of the derivative nature of the immigration status of a noncitizen or lawful permanent resident spouse's immigration status. Generally speaking, that spouse's right to be in the U.S. derives from the citizen or lawful permanent resident spouse's right to file immigration papers seeking to have the immigration member of the couple be granted lawful permanent residency. 
   In the vast majority of cases, granting that right to the citizen or lawful permanent resident spouse makes sense. After all, the purpose of family immigration is to allow U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents to live here with their spouses and children. But in the unusual case of the abusive relationship, an abusive citizen or lawful permanent resident can use control over his or her spouse's visa as a means to blackmail and control the spouse. The abusive spouse can do this by withholding a promised visa petition and then threatening to turn the abused spouse in to the immigration authorities if the abused spouse sought to leave the abuser or report the abuse. 
   VAWA 1994 changed this by allowing immigrants who demonstrate that they have been battered or subject to extreme cruelty by their U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident spouses to file their own petitions for visas without the cooperation of their abusive spouse. 
   VAWA 1994 also allowed abused spouses placed in removal proceedings to seek ``cancellation of removal,'' a form of discretionary relief from removal available to individuals in unlawful immigration status with strong equities, after three years rather than the seven ordinarily required. Finally, VAWA 1994 granted similar rights to minor children abused by their citizen or lawful permanent resident parent, whose immigration status, like that of the abused spouse, would otherwise be dependent on the abusive parent. 
   The conference report follows the Senate VAWA reauthorization bill in building on the important work of VAWA 1994 in these areas. I will not describe all of the provisions of title V of division B of this bill, but I will discuss one of them, which I believe is the most important one. 
   In this bill, we establish procedures under which a battered immigrant can take all the steps he or she needs to take to become a lawful permanent resident without leaving this country. Right now, no such mechanism is available to a battered immigrant, who can begin the process here but must return to his or her home country to complete it. 
   VAWA 1994 created a mechanism for the immigrant to take the first step, the filing of an application to be classified as a battered immigrant spouse or child. But it did not create a mechanism for him or her to obtain the necessary papers to get lawful permanent residency while staying in the U.S. That is because at the time it was enacted, there was a general mechanism available to many to adjust here, which has since been eliminated. As a result, under current law, the battered immigrant has to go back to his or her home country, get a visa, and return here in order to adjust status. 
   That is not true of spouses whose citizens or lawful permanent resident husband or wife is filing immigration papers for them. They do have a mechanism for completing the whole process here. Section 1503 of this bill gives the abused spouse that same right. 
   The importance of such a provision is demonstrated, for example, by the case of a battered immigrant whose real name I will not use, but whom I will instead call Yaa. I use her as an example because her case arose in my own State of Michigan. 
   Yaa is a 38-year-old mother of two from Nigeria. She met her husband, whom I will call Martin, while he was visiting family members in Nigeria. After a long courtship, Martin persuaded Yaa to marry him and join him in the United States. He told her he would help her further her education and file the necessary papers to enable her to become a lawful permanent resident. 
   Following their marriage, Martin assisted Yaa in obtaining a visitor's visa. When she arrived in the United States, however, he did not follow through on any of his promises. He refused to support her going to school, and indeed would not let her leave the house for fear that other men might find her attractive and steal her away. He also refused to file immigration papers for her  and threatened her with deportation if she ever disobeyed his orders. 
   After the birth of their first child, Martin began physically abusing Yaa. He slapped her if she questioned his authority or asked about her immigration status. He spat on her if she refused to have sex with him. He used a hidden recording device to tape all of her phone conversations. As a result, she came to feel that she was a prisoner in her own home. 
   On one occasion, Martin beat Yaa with his fists and a bottle of alcohol. Yaa suffered severe facial injuries and had to be rushed to a hospital by ambulance for treatment. This incident resulted in Martin's arrest and prosecution for domestic violence. Martin retaliated by refusing to pay the mortgage, buy food, or other necessities. At that point, with the help of her best friend, Yaa moved out, found a job, and filed a self-petition under VAWA. INS approved her self-petition, and Yaa has obtained a restraining order against Martin. 
   Unfortunately, she still has to go to Nigeria to obtain a visa in order to complete the process of becoming a lawful permanent resident. And this is a major problem. Martin's family in Nigeria blames her for Martin's conviction. They have called her from there and threatened to have her deported because she ``brought shame'' to the family. They also know where she lives in Nigeria and they have threatened to hurt her and kidnap the children if she comes back. She has no one in the U.S. to leave the children with if she were to return alone. She is also frightened of what Martin's family will do to her if she sets foot in Nigeria. 
   Yaa should be allowed to complete the process of becoming a lawful permanent resident here in the United States, without facing these risks. Our legislation will give her the means to do so. 
   Of all the victims of domestic abuse, the immigrant dependent on an abusive spouse for her right to be in this country faces some of the most severe problems. In addition to the ordinary difficulties that confront anyone trying to deal with an abusive relationship, the battered immigrant also is afraid that if she goes to the authorities, she risks deportation at the instance of her abusive spouse, and either having her children deported too or being separated from them and unable to protect them. 
   We in Congress who write the immigration laws have a responsibility to do what we can to make sure they are not misused in this fashion. That is why I am so pleased that the final version of this legislation includes this and other important provisions. 
   I would like to extend special thanks to Senator KENNEDY and his staff, especially Esther Olavarria, who has worked tirelessly on this portion of the bill; to Senator HATCH and his staff, especially Sharon Prost, whose assistance in crafting these provisions and willingness to invest time, effort and capital in making the case for them has been indispensable; to Senator BIDEN and his staff, especially Bonnie Robin-Vergeer, whose commitment to these provisions has likewise been vital; to House Judiciary Committee Chairman HYDE and House Crime Subcommittee Chairman BILL MCCOLLUM, for their support at key moments; to the indefatigable Leslye Orloff of the NOW Legal Defense Fund, whose ability to come up with the ``one more thing'' desperately needed by battered immigrants is matched only by her good humor and professionalism in recognizing that the time for compromise has come; and to the sponsors of H.R. 3244 and S. 2449, for allowing their bill to become the vehicle for this important legislation. 
   I would also like to thank all of the organizations in Michigan that have been working so hard to help in the fight against domestic and sexual violence. I would like to extend particular thanks to a couple of the people there who have been particularly helpful to me, to my wife Jane, and to members of my office as we have been learning about these issues: to Mary Keefe of the Michigan Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, whom I mentioned earlier; to Hedy Nuriel and Deborah Danton of Haven; to Shirley Pascale of the Council Against Domestic Assault; to Deborah Patterson of Turning Point, and to Valerie Hoffman of the Underground Railroad. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to give recognition to one of Michigan State University's oldest institutions, the Spartan Marching Band. The Spartan Marching Band was formed in 1870 at the then Michigan Agricultural College, by Civil War Veteran and student Ransom Mc.Donough. The band consisted of ten members and was all brass. The small group participated in drills and parades. 
   Throughout its 130 years, the band has evolved tremendously with the times as any successful organization must. And throughout its long history, the band has exemplified excellence and has represented the university with great pride and honor. The Michigan State University Marching Band welcomed the football team and fans for over 100 years and has accompanied the team to numerous bowl games, including four Rose Bowl appearances. The band has played for four presidents and appeared at the New York World's Fair. 
   The person who had perhaps the most significant impact on the Spartan Marching Band was Leonard Falcone. Mr. Falcone was appointed band director in 1927 and served Michigan State university and the Music program for 40 years. Mr. Falcone was affectionately known as ``The Dean of Big Ten Bands.'' Aside from his unprecedented tenure, Mr. Falcone is credited with arranging the music to the MSU Alma Mater, ``MSU Shadows'' and composing the music to the greatest college fight song in the world, the ``MSU Fight Song.'' So revered was Mr. Falcone that on the eve of his death in 1985, former and present members of the Spartan Marching Band visited him and serenaded him with the ``MSU Fight Son'' and ``MSU Shadows.'' 
   The Spartan Marching Band has continuously set the standard for the Nation's marching bands. It is well known throughout our State and Nation for its innovative and intricate marching style and excellent musical arrangements. Through its long legacy, which continues today under the fine leadership of band director John T. Madden, the Spartan Marching Band continues to set the standard for Michigan State pride. 
   Through its achievements the Spartan Marching Band has represented the face of Michigan State University for the past 130 years. From its street beat cadence called ``The Series,'' to the traditional ``Kick-Step'' entrance into the stadium for pregame, to the singing of ``MSU Shadows,'' to Military regimental traditions adhered to by all members, the Spartan Marching Band is a true ambassador of Michigan State University. As a Michigan State University Alumnus, I would like to thank the Spartan Marching Band for its contributions to MSU pride and congratulate all members of the 300 plus-member band of today and all past members of the Spartan Marching Band on 130 years of tradition, excellence, innovation, and pride. Go Green!

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Father Nicholas Maestrini and Father John Boracco, two men who have dedicated their lives in service to the Catholic Church, and who have often found their paths cross along the way. On October 22, 2000, the paths of these old friends will converge once again, as they will be honored together by the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions (PIME) in Detroit, Michigan, in recognition of their 70th Anniversary of Ordination. 
   Fr. Maestrini and Fr. Boracco began their long histories of dedicated service to the Catholic Church together as seminary classmates in Monza, Italy. Shortly after becoming ordained priests, both chose to enter into the PIME missionary. PIME is an international community of priests, lay missionaries and lay volunteers who have dedicated their lives to service in foreign lands. Founded in Italy in 1850, it is now a global organization that operates missions throughout the world. Its international headquarters are in Rome, Italy, while PIME U.S. Region is based out of Detroit. 
   Both Fr. Maestrini and Fr. Boracco joined missions in Asia, and both experienced struggle and hardship there during the chaotic period before, during and after World War II. Fr. Maestrini served as a missionary in Hong Kong from 1931-50. During this time, he suffered through the strife of the Great War and of being interned by the Japanese. Fr. Boracco had it no easier in China, where he was stationed from 1934-54, first in the northern Henan Province and then at Kai Pheng. He was forced to persevere through imprisonment, the Japanese occupation, and the Communist revolution. In 1954, he was condemned to die at the hands of the Communists, but was instead expelled. 
   In 1951, Fr. Maestrini was named Superior of the PIME U.S. Region. Four years later, he was joined in Detroit by Fr. Boracco, who was assigned to help with the seminary expansion started by his friend. For the next 19 years, the two formed the perfect team. Fr. Maestrini focused his energy on external matters, such as public relations and fundraising, while Fr. Boracco served as rector and spiritual director  of PIME's theological and high school seminars. With success, their roles expanded. Fr. Maestrini oversaw the establishment of three seminaries, two award-winning films, and many fund raising and public relations programs benefitting the foreign missions. Fr. Boracco became Director of the PIME residence for priests, brothers and seminaries. While Fr. Maestrini retired as Superior in 1974, Fr. Boracco retired just last year. 
   Both Fr. Boracco and Fr. Maestrini remain active within the Catholic community. Aside from assisting at his local parish, Fr. Maestrini publishes a mission newsletter, and continues correspondence with missionaries and benefactors. Fr. Boracco regularly assists several parishes in the Archdiocese of Detroit. 
   I applaud Fr. Maestrini and Fr. Boracco on their extraordinary legacies of service. For 70 years, they have tirelessly spread the message of faith and good will to others embodied by the Catholic Church, and they have done so while forming a friendship that is truly unique. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Father Nicholas Maestrini and Father John Boracco on 70 years of successful service, and wish them both continued success in the future.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Norwegian Club of Detroit, which will celebrate its 75th Anniversary in Orchard Lake, Michigan, on October 14, 2000. Only Ireland has had a larger percentage of its population immigrate to the United States than has Norway. As Norwegians arrived in Michigan, the Norwegian Club of Detroit was there to help them adjust to their new homeland, while at the same time continue to celebrate the familiar traditions of home. 
   The Norwegian Club of Detroit was organized in 1925. Originally consisting of only engineers, it quickly expanded to include Norwegians from all walks of life, providing an important cultural, social and professional network for Michigan's Norwegian community. 
   An example of the Club's importance to the Norwegian community can clearly be seen during World War II, when members managed to mobilize and ultimately provide support to Norwegian military forces who escaped the Nazi invasion. Members also organized training in Canada to assist in the war effort of the Allies. 
   The Norwegian Club of Detroit remains an important factor in celebrating and promoting Norwegian and Scandinavian cultural, political and economic ties to the State of Michigan. One of the first groups to participate in the Ethnic Festivals in Detroit, the Club also has helped support performances by the Scandinavian Symphony, a visit by the Hjemkomst Viking ship reproduction, as well as various Norwegian performers and artists. 
   Mr. President, 2000 is an extremely important year in the Norwegian-American community. It is the 100th Anniversary of the founding of Oslo, Norway's capital city, as well as the 1000th Anniversary of the Viking discovery of North America. This year also marks 175 years of Norwegian immigration to the United States. Amidst all of this, and on behalf of the entire United States Senate, I wish the Norwegian Club of Detroit a Happy 75th Anniversary, and continued success in the future.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Captain William James Bushaw, who is retiring from the United States Navy after nearly 30 years of service. Captain Bushaw leaves behind a legacy of versatility and consistency, as he has consistently been successful in whatever area he has been asked to perform. 
   Upon graduating from the University of Michigan, Captain Bushaw attended Navy Officer Candidate School in Newport, Rhode Island. He was commissioned as an ensign May 14, 1971, receiving the award of Distinguished Naval Graduate. 
   While on active duty, Captain Bushaw served as the Gunnery Officer aboard the U.S.S. Joseph Strauss. From January of 1972 until August of that same year he participated in several combat operations in Vietnam, including Operation Freedom Train, Operation Linebacker and Operation Notification Line. During these operations, U.S.S. Joseph Strauss fired over 15,000 rounds of ammunition, earning the Navy Unit Citation. Captain Bushaw himself earned the Navy Achievement Medal with Combat V and the Combat Action Award. 
   Following active duty Captain Bushaw transferred to the selected reserve. As a drilling reservist, he served as Commanding Officer of three Navy reserve units and Executive Officer of two other units. For his efforts, he received a Navy Commendation Medal. 
   Captain Bushaw currently serves as the Emergency Preparedness Liaison Officer to the Governor of the State of Michigan, representing the United States Navy in all issues of emergency preparedness. He recently received the State Legion of Merit award from the Adjutant General of the Michigan National Guard. 
   I applaud Captain Bushaw on nearly thirty years of extraordinary service to our Nation. I know that the United States Navy will greatly miss his leadership, as will the many men he has commanded. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I thank Captain William James Bushaw for his service, and wish him the best of luck in retirement.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize St. Clement Catholic Church in Center Line, Michigan, which will celebrate 150 years of service to the Warren and Center Line communities with an anniversary mass on October 15, 2000. The story of St. Clement is one of continual adaptation and growth, but through it all the spirit that existed in 1850 remains today, for the church has never stayed from its original purpose of teaching the timeless lessons of faith and love. 
   The perfect illustration of how important St. Clement is to the Warren and Center Line communities can be seen in how many times it has been forced to be reconstructed. In 1857, a school was added to the church. After expansions to the original building in 1868 and 1879, the growing size of the congregation forced a new building to be constructed in 1880. In 1922, a new school had to be built to accommodate the growing number of students, and, ultimately, another school was constructed anew in 1953. In May of 1960, ground broke on the present church building. It is an extraordinary piece of architecture, a Cruciform-shaped structure with a 65 foot high vaulted ceiling, gables that form a cross, hundreds of stain-glassed panes, a main altar of imported marble, a seating capacity of over 1,600 worshippers and two cry rooms. 
   An essential part of the success of St. Clement Church has been its leadership. From 1868-1890, Father William Hendrix guided the growing church to the point where it had firmly established its presence as the center of social activity in the Warren and Center Line communities. From 1890-1929, Father John Kramer's devotion to improving education was essential not only to having the new school be built, but also to filling it with nearly 400 students. Father Alexander Mayer guided the parish through the Depression, World War II and the Korean War, and his leadership enabled the church to make it through years of financial hardship. 
   Father Timothy Edward Murray oversaw the building of the third St. Clement Church, as well as set up a program where St. Clement Schools became involved in a shared-time program with Center Line Public Schools. In 1976, Father James Murphy returned a warmth and camaderie to the parish. From 1992-97, the Rev. Dr. Arthur J. Jacobi, Jr.'s many skills both as an educator and as a professional businessman helped to lead St. Clement both spiritually and financially. And today, Father Ron Victor continues in this strong tradition of leadership, overseeing the growth and adaptation that is a necessary part of any church's history, while at the same time shepherding his parish on its continuous mission of faith and love. 
   For 150 years, St. Clement Catholic Church has been an essential part of the Warren and Center Line communities. It has been a constant source of leadership within these communities, and has guided them through both good and bad times. It has also provided thousands of children with a solid foundation upon which to grow and become upstanding members of their own communities. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate St. Clement Catholic Church on 150 successful years of leadership and growth, and wish the church continued success in the future.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Core City Neighborhoods of Detroit, Michigan, which will hold its 16th Annual Meeting and Dinner on October 12, 2000. In its sixteen years, Core City Neighborhoods has been a leader in the field of community development, serving and supporting the residents and small businesses of Southwest Detroit in an exemplary manner. 
   The mission of Core City Neighborhoods is to strengthen the social and human development of the Southwest Detroit community while at the same time helping to spur the physical and economic development of the area. The organization does this through a variety of programs, focusing on such  things as youth and adult leadership to training and employment. 
   One of the most successful Core City Neighborhoods program has been an after school program for children aged 6-13. The program seeks to strengthen academic and life skills, such as substance abuse and violence prevention, as well as provide a safe and positive environment for the youth involved. The program also provides children with tutoring and mentoring. They work on homework together, and play board games and sports in an effort to aid in the development of teamwork skills and self confidence. 
   Another program sponsored by CCN is the Multi-Family Apartment Building Acquisition and Rehabilitation Program. The goal of this program is to prevent further loss of highly visible apartment buildings, buildings which truly serve as the foundations of the Southwest Detroit community. The program includes counseling. Homebuyers Club, Home Repair workshops, loans and referrals on such topics as credit and budgeting. 
   Core City Neighborhoods has also been directly responsible for the development of nearly 200 units of housing, totaling over $12 million of reinvestment into the Southeast Detroit community. This includes the development of the Alberta W. King Village Apartments, which were built to house low to moderate income families. 
   I applaud the many people involved with Core City Neighborhoods on the extraordinary work they have done on behalf of Southwest Detroit. No group works harder to build up this community, both physically and spiritually. On behalf of the entire United States Senate I thank Core city Neighborhoods for fifteen successful years of civic service, and wish the organization continued success in the future.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee is not here. I believe he would approve of my yielding myself such time as I may need to speak this morning. 
   Mr. President, the H-1B visa program, which we will be addressing today when we vote on the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-first Century Act, is the subject of much interesting debate in our country today. One thing everybody agrees on is we face a serious worker shortage with respect to high-tech employment and skilled labor in America today. Most of the recent studies that have been produced on this subject indicate there are perhaps as many as 1 million unfilled positions in information technology today. The projections are that we will be creating somewhere between 150,000 and 200,000 new positions in these areas in each of the next 10 years. Yet in spite of the very lucrative and, I think, substantive nature of these jobs, our training programs, our college programs, our high school programs are not producing enough American workers to fill these posts today. 
   This presents us with a short-term problem and a long-term challenge. The short-term problem is how to fill these key positions immediately so that we don't lose opportunities to foreign competitors, or so that we don't force American businesses to move offshore to where skilled workers might live. The long-term problem is to determine what we can do to make certain that in the future we have a sufficient workforce of trained Americans to fill these jobs, because it is quite clear to me that immigration can only be a stopgap, short-term solution to these problems. 
   I am pleased we have reached an agreement on this legislation across the aisle with our colleagues because we need to act today. The legislation before us will allow a short-term increase in the number of skilled professionals allowed to work in this country on H-1B temporary visas and will help and encourage more disadvantaged young people to pursue studies related to high-tech. It will assure those young people of good jobs and good wages far into the future, and I believe it will also provide resources for the training and retraining of people in the workforce today, so they can begin to fill more of these positions as well. 
   To help young people, this bill will provide, we estimate, over 60,000 scholarships for American students in the math and science fields. Scholarships like this have already been available as a result of the American Competitiveness Act, which we passed in 1998--legislation that began the process of diverting application fees connected to the H-1B visas into scholarship and retraining funds. 
   The bill's training provisions will provide over 150,000 U.S. workers with access to training to help prepare them for the high-tech jobs of today and tomorrow. Interestingly, Mr. President, there is overwhelming unanimity that we must act in this fashion if we are to keep our economy strong. The support  from across the political spectrum for this H-1B visa increase is strong, ranging from the White House--not just the current occupant and staff but such people as former chief economic adviser to President Clinton, Laura D'Andrea, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, and legislative leaders on both sides of the aisle. 
   Indeed, in hearings we have conducted in the Immigration Subcommittee, we have heard from people throughout industry in America, not just the high-tech companies we think of when we think about these workers but people who employ high-tech workers in other phases and forms of manufacturing across the board; they have all indicated that the need to fill these provisions is significant and immediate. Indeed, we received countless pieces of information that led to a pretty clear indication that if we don't allow these technically skilled workers to come here, companies will be forced to move product lines, divisions perhaps, and whole operations overseas. 
   That won't help Americans. That will cost Americans jobs. Of course, there are those who have criticized this program over the years--people who are protectionist in their views on these sorts of issues. But it is important to make sure the record is clear that we can build in protections for American workers to make certain that they cannot be taken advantage of through the high-tech H-1B program. 
   Indeed, in 1998 we addressed many, if not all, of the issues which were raised with respect to H-1B visas and the possible displacement of Americans workers. 
   In 1988, the bill wrote into law three types of lay-off protections for American workers. And we have also, of course, included in the H-1B program requirements that the prevailing wage be paid to people who come in under this program so companies cannot game the system and somehow or another in any way pay foreign workers less and thus deprive American workers of opportunities. But, as I said, whether it is the Silicon Valley or the Research Triangle or the traditionally well-known high-tech sectors or whether it is in my State of Michigan, the need for these workers is extraordinarily strong. 
   For instance, the Michigan Economic Development Corporation is spending $2.7 million on an ad campaign and a revamped web site to attract knowledgeable workers to our State. The head of our economic development division says we are the only State to fully redirect our resources to recruiting businesses for recruiting workers to Michigan. Indeed, in one county alone--Oakland County--the estimate is that we currently need 10,000 engineers just to fill the positions that are projected to be needed today and in the immediate future. If we can't find those people, those companies and the jobs that are connected to those engineering jobs will go elsewhere. It is a challenge that we must address. 
   Let me just say that in the short term the only appropriate way we are going to be able to deal with this is through an increase in the H-1B visa program. But the long-term solution cannot be based on immigration alone. Indeed, this program is only a 3-year increase. 
   I think it is clear that the world now is competing. Virtually any country that wants to be competitive is working hard to attract the most talented and skilled people to their country and to their businesses to create strength in their economies. Thus, America must, in addition to the passage of today's legislation, focus even more of our resources and more of our attention on the important need of both encouraging young people to pursue careers in math, science, engineering, computer sciences, and so on but also in retraining workers to try to fill more of these positions because I predict that in the very near future immigration will not even come close to meeting our employment needs with respect to these high-tech positions. 
   For those reasons, the provisions which were launched in the 1998 American Competitiveness Act, and which are strengthened even in this legislation, I hope by the time we finish this process, will provide even more resources for education and training which are key to the long-term needs that we have in this country. 
   They alone will not be enough because it is pretty obvious that to generate the kind of skilled workforce in the 21st century needed to fill the sorts of technology positions that are going to be created, whether they are positions in the 
   research area or manufacturing area or anywhere else, requires us to go well beyond even what we will have in this legislation. 
   I am very dedicated to working to make sure that we provide the Federal support necessary to make it possible for those kinds of technology positions to be filled by American workers. But it is going to take a comprehensive effort--an effort that is not just a Federal program but one that incorporates the private sector as well as the public sector, the corporate sector, and the government sector at all levels, and to involve our education system at all levels or we will find ourselves seeing foreign competitors gaining ground on America when it comes to leading the world with respect to advanced technologies. 
   This means that not only must we make sure that the students today get the training they need but that the college programs be expanded and the retraining programs be generated. It also means that we must address so many other issues--whether it is passing our Millennium Classrooms Act which will provide more computer courses for the classrooms of America, especially those in the economically disadvantaged areas or whether it means working together in a collaborative effort with the private sector to ensure that there are more resources directed at education and the training of workers who are in the workforce today, it is all part of what we must address or we will find that in the global economy of the 21st century our competitive edge is going to be somewhat reduced. We certainly don't want that to happen. 
   I compliment Senator HATCH for his ongoing leadership on this issue. We have worked together since 1998 when we passed the American Competitiveness Act. He has been a leader on these issues for many years. His leadership in the passage of this legislation, and his willingness to come to the floor and work over a very long period of time to make sure this bill, which we passed out of the Judiciary Committee by an overwhelming vote many months ago, finally, today, gets the consideration it deserves. I think he deserves all of our thanks. Hopefully, this process will now move quickly towards completion, and we will be able to provide the additional workers needed to make sure the key positions in technology in our country will be filled. 
   I say also to those who have raised some of the other immigration-related issues that as chairman of the subcommittee, I remain anxious to continue to work with people--whether it is on the H-2A visa program, the agricultural workers issues, or Latino fairness issues, and so on. It is unfortunate that we couldn't come to an agreement on this legislation some months ago when we were trying to work out an agreement. But certainly the subcommittee intends to continue to focus on these issues into the future. I look forward to working with my colleagues on all of these. 
   In conclusion, I thank Senator HATCH for working with me on this. I appreciate his leadership very much. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, a week ago I met with a national workforce coalition of unions that came out in support of establishing Permanent Normal Trading Relations with China. I had encountered some of the labor leaders who belong to this coalition on several other occasions, including at the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia in August. I simply rise today to note for my colleagues that organized labor in this country is not monolithic in their views on such matters as trade and protectionism. 
   The members of the coalition I met with last week came primarily from the aerospace industry in the Pacific Northwest, building the jet airplanes, engines, and other aerospace subsystems that are competing globally with the likes of Europe's Airbus. However, I have previously met members of this coalition that extend beyond the aerospace industry and the Pacific Northwest. They represent such traditional manufacturing industries as steel, aluminum, diesel engines, farm equipment, and rail locomotives. They  repesent a diverse array of the American workforce--everything from production workers on the line to engineers and scientists. And they are from across this great nation. 
   The message these union officials had was that they understood that China was a burgeoning market for U.S. exports. They understood that if the U.S. did not approve PNTR for China that we would not only lose the trade concessions they have made to us under this agreement, but we would also lose our ability to gain greater market access and share. And they understood that the largest beneficiary of such an outcome would be our trade competitors in the European Community, in the rest of Asia, and in South America. They understood that one of the best ways to guarantee that American firms remain in the United States--employing American workers and bolstering our economic growth--was to eliminate the existing trade barriers that have served to up until now to freeze out our products or force U.S. companies to move facilities over to China. 
   Without removing these barriers and liberalizing trade between the U.S. and China, American firms seeking to compete with their foreign competitors would have every incentive to move their factories and operations over to China. With PNTR and China's entry into the World Trading Organization we increase the likelihood that American companies will continue to remain located in the United States. And that is good news for the union workers and households in the state of Michigan which will continue to produce a wide array of goods that will be exported to China. 
   As I pointed out in a statement I made on the floor supporting PNTR, exports from Michigan to China increased 25 percent between 1993 and 1998, and they have undoubtedly grown significantly greater since 1998. Exports to China from businesses located in the Flint and Lansing areas grew by 84 percent during that period. Meanwhile, exports to China from Kalamazoo and Battle Creek grew by an extraordinary 353 percent! Not all of that business is going to union shops, but certainly a significant portion of it is, and that sort of expansion in trade with China is going to benefit all workers and businesses in Michigan--union and non-union. 
   Clearly the majority of unions and union members in this country opposed PNTR for China. I heard from and spoke with many, many such workers from Michigan--both back in Michigan and when the unions have come out to Washington, DC, to meet with their representatives in Congress. I come from a union background and grew up in a union household. I took their concerns very seriously in weighing the many issues that went into my ultimate decision to vote for PNTR. And I have pledged to hold China accountable for their future behavior and to fulfill their trade obligations under the WTO's rules and the agreement we have negotiated with them. 
   But there are indeed unions--rank-and-file members and leadership alike--who see the opportunity presented by PNTR and allowing China into the WTO as a tremendous opportunity for the United States to continue to lead the world in productivity and in our economic strength. They are prepared to answer the challenge posed by the global economy and the opening of China's markets, and they recognize the benefits which will result if we are leading the way into opening China to greater trade instead of sitting on the sidelines allowing our trade competitors to reap all the benefits. 
   We should not forget that the U.S. is a very diverse country and that no institution--including organized labor--is a monolithic force. There are folks on both sides of the issue, each feeling very strongly and very sincerely that they are doing what is best for them and their brethren.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in 1982, the United States Department of Education initiated its Blue Ribbon Schools Program. In each year since, the Department has recognized schools throughout the country which excel in all areas of academic leadership, teaching and teacher development, and school curriculum. In other words, Blue Ribbon Schools are the finest public and private secondary schools our Nation has to offer. They are the schools that set the standard for which others strive. I am very proud to report that nine of the 198 Blue Ribbon Schools named by Secretary Richard W. Riley for 1999-2000 are located in the State of Michigan, and I rise today to recognize Wolfe Middle School, in Center Line, Michigan, one of these nine schools. 
   The hope of the Center Line Public School system is that their schools will become places where ``every person will be a teacher, every teacher will be a leader and every student will be a success.'' To this end, Wolfe Middle School is a shining example. Its mission statement lays out the following goals: first, to teach students the knowledge and understanding embedded in the Michigan core curriculum; second, to help students explore their elective areas of interest; and, third, to help students as they make the transition from childhood to adolescence. Wolfe Middle School has been successful in these areas because of the teamwork that has developed, not only among faculty and administrators, but also between parents and community members. 
   This teamwork is best represented in planning teams, groups which involve staff, parents and community members. These teams meet regularly in a constant effort to evaluate, improve and enact goals and objectives which will continue to move Wolfe Middle School and its students in a positive direction. In addition to planning teams, daily teacher team meetings take place in which plans are devised for classroom instruction, grade level activities and professional development. There is an unwavering rule that guides both planning teams and teacher teams: all programs must be dedicated to helping Wolfe students develop academically, socially and emotionally. 
   In recent years, school improvement has focused largely around the premise that every student should leave Wolfe computer literate. The school has two computer labs, as well as a computer in every classroom. Laptop computers are available to take home from the new Media Center which allow students to do computer homework. In 1999, a Technology Education Laboratory was completed which boasts a robotics area, audio and video production studios, and a computer animation station, making it among the most advanced laboratories in the Midwest. It is important to note that providing students with the opportunity to work with computers is part of an overall plan to encourage their participation in other areas of education and social interaction--it is not an end in itself. 
   I applaud the students, parents, faculty and administration of Wolfe Middle School, for I believe this is an award which speaks more to the effort of a united community than it does to the work of a few individuals. With that having been said, I would like to recognize Ms. Sue Gripton, Principal of Wolfe Middle School, whose dedication to making her school one of the finest in our Nation has been instrumental in creating this community. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Wolfe Middle School on being named a Blue Ribbon School for 1999-2000, and wish the school continued success in the future.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the American Federation of Muslims of Indian Origin (AFMIO), which will hold its 10th Annual Convention on October 7-8, 2000 in Southfield, Michigan. The theme of the convention is ``Information and Technology: The Digital Divide,'' providing members of the AFMIO with an opportunity to explore new ways to expand upon the many beneficial things the organization is already doing in this realm. 
   The AFMIO is an umbrella organization which represents various Indian Muslim Associations. It has chapters throughout the world, and a membership which includes academicians, professionals, entrepreneurs and social activists. The mission of the organization is the educational and economic upliftment of Indian Muslims by seeking cooperation among the American and Indian relief and educational organizations. 
   The AFMIO stands for a stable democratic, secular and progressive India, where the human rights of all citizens, regardless of caste, religion, language or region, are preserved. The organization works in close cooperation with others that believe in these same principles, and thus serves as a bridge between Indian intellectuals, public officials and business people, and Indian Americans, particularly Muslims. 
   The highest priority of the AFMIO continues to be the eradication of illiteracy among Indian Muslim children, a goal which goes hand in hand with bridging the digital divide. Access to a computer can upon up new worlds for children, and ensure that they are not only literate in the traditional sense, but culturally literate as well, which I think is equally important. In this regard, AFMIO has already done a great deal. Its grassroots mobilization and motivation program is termed as one of the most successful education programs in India. 
   AFMIO has also done much to aid Indian Muslims on other fronts. The organization has financed several projects which draw on the resources of local communities and aim for the economic upliftment of these communities by teaching citizens how to employ these resources. Through programs of political education and awareness, the organization has united forces that have similar beliefs of social justice and the upliftment of all people. Furthermore, it has been responsible for establishing several hospitals and orphanages, and has organized relief work at times of natural disasters. 
   I applaud the AFMIO for all of the wonderful work it has done to improve the living conditions of Indian Muslims. A large part of this success stems from educational programs which have been incredibly successful, and I am sure the discussion this weekend will focus upon how these programs can be even further adapted and improved in this Digital Age. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I extend a much deserved thank you to the American Federation of Muslims of Indian Origin, and wish the organization continued success in the future.

In other words, Blue Ribbon Schools are the finest public and private secondary schools our Nation has to offer. They are the schools that set the standard for which others strive. I am very proud to report that 9 of the 198 Blue Ribbon Schools named by Secretary Richard W. Riley for 1999-2000 are located in the State of Michigan, and I rise today to recognize Novi High School in Novi, Michigan, one of these nine schools. 
   In the past 30 years, enrollment at Novi High School has grown from approximately 360 students to 1,577 students. This is representative of the changing shape of the City of Novi during this time period, as it has evolved from a rural crossroads to a thriving Detroit suburb. To deal with the influx of students, in 1996 Novi High School concluded a renovation which had lasted for 30 months and added over 40 percent to the original facility. The school now covers 382,000 feet on three levels, and includes state of the art instructional areas, science labs, a media center, physical education and fine art complexes, and telecommunications systems. All classrooms have e-mail and Internet access as well as voice communications and two-way interactive video within and between district buildings. 
   The administrators and faculty of Novi High School are committed to providing their students with a well-rounded educational program, including a rigorous academic schedule, a variety of extra-curricular and athletic programs, and an active student leadership program. This commitment led to a two-year, teacher-led initiative of research and review of outstanding international high schools. Following this process, Novi High School restructured into a four-block class schedule so that students would be allowed access to a broader range of curriculum and would also be able to take advantage of the new technology available for their use. Perhaps more importantly, the review and realignment of the curriculum led to a transformation of instructional strategies, from traditional lecture to interactive, higher-order thinking and application-assessment which have redefined the entire education program of Novi High School. 
   Novi High School has received many awards, including the ``What Parents Want'' award from SchoolMatch for seven consecutive years (1993-99), a Gold Medal District Rating by Expansion Management Magazine for three years (1996-98), and in 1999 U.S. News and World Report selected it as one of the top 96 ``Outstanding American High Schools.'' Being named a Blue Ribbon School for 1999-2000 is reflective of a desire on the part of administration and faculty to continue to provide a better education to the students of Novi High School. The staff firmly believes that a quality education program is never static; rather, it continually needs to be adapted and improved as new resources and different methods of teaching become available. This willingness to adapt has been instrumental in the success of Novi High School, and I am sure will continue to be instrumental as the school leads other high schools, not only in the State of Michigan but throughout the country, into the future. 
   I applaud the students, parents, faculty and administration of Novi High School, for I believe this is an award which speaks more to the effort of a united community than it does to the work of a few individuals. With that having been said, I would like to recognize Dr. Jennifer Putnam Cheal, Principal of Novi High School, whose dedication to making her school one of the finest in our Nation has been instrumental in creating this community. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Novi High School on being named a Blue Ribbon School for 1999-2000, and wish the school continued success in the future.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Association of Chinese Americans, Detroit Chapter of the National Organization of Chinese Americans, which will celebrate its 28th Anniversary with an Awards Ceremony on October 7, 2000. The theme of the evening is Unity, Collaboration and Strength, three things the ACA has provided Michigan's Chinese American community since its inception in 1972. 
   The mission of the ACA is ``to serve the Chinese American community in the Greater Detroit area, and to promote the overall presence of Chinese Americans.'' In order to do this effectively, members laid out six goals for their organization: provide community services to people of Chinese heritage; promote the Chinese presence locally and nationally through the political system; make sure the voice of the Chinese American is heard locally and nationally; promote academic excellence in Chinese American youth; promote Chinese heritage through the arts; and collaborate with other Chinese/Asian organizations. 
   In its effort to achieve above and beyond these goals, the ACA has become an active force within the Metropolitan Detroit community. It operates service and outreach centers in Detroit, Warren and Plymouth which provide assistance to Chinese Americans in immigration matters, language classes, citizenship preparation, and registering to vote. It sponsors a free health clinic  and activities in Detroit Chinatown for the language and economically disadvantaged. In addition, the ACA sponsors many programs for the entire community, including the Feed the Homeless program, flood and emergency disaster relief, and a bone marrow drive. 
   The ACA provides young Chinese Americans with the opportunity to meet people of their own heritage, but also teaches them the benefits of a well-balanced routine. Each year the organization sponsors camping trips, dancing parties, and basketball games. At the same time, the organization has sponsored annual High School Achievement Awards since 1984. These awards recognize seniors who have achieved academic excellence as well as involvement and leadership in extracurricular activities. Scholarships funded by the ACA and private donors are also provided annually to Chinese Americans seeking higher education. 
   Promoting Chinese heritage has always been a fundamental goal of the ACA, as members strive not to let their proud ancestry be overlooked or forgotten. Events include celebrating Asian American Heritage Month, promoting the Chinese New Year Commemorative stamps, and sponsoring or cosponsoring a plethora of cultural events. Recently, the ACA held a reception for Chinese American author Helen Zia, and on September 9, 2000, the organization hosted the Michigan premiere of the documentary film, ``We Served With Pride,'' which chronicles the effort of Chinese American soldiers during World War II. 
   I applaud the ACA on the wonderful work it has done in the Metropolitan Detroit region. Since its founding in 1972, the organization has encouraged Michigan's Chinese Americans to celebrate both their Chinese heritage and the lives they have found in the United States. It has fought vehemently for the rights of Chinese Americans yet remains an inclusive group, offering assistance not only to Chinese Americans, but to all Americans. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate the Association of Chinese Americans on 28 glorious years, and wish the organization continued success in the future.

In each year since, the Department has recognized schools throughout the country which excel in all areas of academic leadership, teaching and teacher development, and school curriculum. In other words, Blue Ribbon Schools are the finest public and private secondary schools our Nation has to offer. They are the  schools that set the standard for which others strive. I am very proud to report that nine of the 198 Blue Ribbon Schools named by Secretary Richard W. Riley for 1999-2000 are located in the State of Michigan, and I rise today to recognize Cousino High School in Warren, Michigan, one of these nine schools. 
   Cousino High School is a contemporary American high school set amongst the ``Big Three'' members of the auto industry--General Motors, Ford Motor Company and DaimlerChrysler. Much of the instructional program at Cousino relies upon the same forces that drive these international automotive giants, a fact which can be attributed to the large participation of the Warren community in the affairs of Cousino High School. Teachers, administrators, and parents, along with nearly 300 leaders from local business and industry, are directly involved in shaping the educational program. This involvement has been instrumental in creating the high student achievement level that has become a trademark of Cousino High School. 
   A large part of this program is devoted to ensuring that students who graduate Cousino High School leave tecnologically competent. All Cousino classes use technology as a tool to facilitate learning. Multiple computer labs spread throughout the building and additional computers in the media center and classrooms allow students to easily access the Internet. In addition, Cousino's proximity to the General Motors Technical Center, the world's largest auto research institute, and the satellite automotive and technical businesses nearby, have provided students with an opportunity to see first-hand the many doors that their education will open for them. This focus on technology has complemented the core subjects of literature, humanitites, philosophy and the arts to provide students with a well-balanced educational foundation. 
   Of course, no school could be successful without students and parents who are willing to devote time and energy to see that their school is indeed successful. This dedication has occurred time and again at Cousino High School. Parents have consistently served on the Principal's Advisory Committee and School Improvement Plan committees, have volunteered in Booster Clubs and for other school activities, and helped to promote school spirit by promoting school events. This parental enthusiasm has rubbed off onto students of Cousino High. Over 80 percent of students participate in extracurricular activities, and students have led the way in aiding the community as a whole, working tirelessly for numerous charities. 
   I applaud the students, parents, faculty and administration of Cousino High School, for I believe this is an award which speaks more to the effort of a united community than it does to the work of a few individuals. With that having been said, I would like to recognize Mr. Joseph Sayers, Principal of Cousino High School, whose dedication to making his school one of the finest in our Nation has been instrumental in creating this community. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Cousino High School on being named a Blue Ribbon School for 1999-2000, and wish the school continued success in the future.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. I, too, am committed to seeing to it that there is funding for these programs and a $1,000 fee is appropriate and would accomplish this goal. As the Ranking Member knows, I believe that as far as the shortage of highly skilled workers is concerned, we have both a short term and long term problem, and I believe these programs are an integral part of addressing our long term problem. I very much appreciation your ongoing willingness to work on these important programs for training and educating Americans so that they will be ready to take these jobs, and the leadership you have shown on these matters. I pledge to work with you, the other Members of this body, the business community, and other affected outside interests to seek ways to help fund these programs consistent with the principle you articulated.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to support the passage of H.R. 3767, the Visa Waiver Permanent Program Act. This legislation, as amended, is important not only because it facilitates travel and tourism in the United States, thereby creating many American jobs, but also because it benefits American tourists who wish to travel abroad, since visa requirements are generally waived on a reciprocal basis. 
   The Visa Waiver Pilot Program authorizes the Attorney General to waive visa requirements for foreign nationals traveling from certain designated countries as temporary visitors for business or pleasure. Aliens from the participating countries complete an admission form prior to arrival and are admitted to stay for up to 90 days.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I rise today to offer my thanks to Senator SMITH, the chairman of the Environment Committee and commend him for his successful effort to pass the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. 
   Included in this legislation is language I crafted with Representatives EHLERS and CAMP to further clarify the extent of the Great Lakes Governors' authority over diversions of Great Lakes water to locations outside the basin. This amendment makes clear that both diversions of water for use within the U.S. and exports of water to locations outside the U.S. may occur only with the consent of all eight Great Lakes governors. Questions over the definition of ``diversion'' made this clarification necessary. 
   Almost as important, this amendment demonstrates that it is the intent of the Congress that the states work cooperatively with the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec to develop common standards for conservation of Great Lakes water and mechanisms for withdrawals. Such cooperation is crucial if we are to have equal and effective programs for conserving these waters and maintaining the health of the Great Lakes. 
   In closing, let me state that I regret that my colleague, the senior Senator from Michigan did not join me in this effort. We share differing opinions over  the need for clarification of the 1986 act. And while I disagreed with his interpretation of the definition of ``bulk fresh water,'' because diversions of water for use within the U.S. are already distinctly covered in the 1986 act, I nevertheless modified the amendment at his request, and I share his commitment to protecting the tremendous resources for future generations.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, each year the Southeast Michigan Chapter of the March of Dimes recognizes a select group of individuals whose contributions to the Macomb County, Michigan, community have been invaluable. I rise today to recognize Mr. Philip E. Greco and Mrs. Donna Greco Issa, the winners of the 2000 Alexander Macomb Family of the Year Award. They will be presented this award at a dinner benefitting the March of Dimes on September 27, 2000. 
   Mr. Greco and Mrs. Greco Issa hold the position of President and Treasurer, respectively, at the Philip F. Greco Title Company, which was founded by their father in 1972. The two learned the business working alongside their father, and helped the company establish three regional offices and five satellite businesses. 
   Both Mr. Greco and Mrs. Greco Issa are very active within the Macomb County community. Mr. Greco is President of the advisory board for the St. John's North Shore Hospital. He is also a member of the Italian American Chamber of Commerce of Michigan, a past Commodore of both the North Channel Yacht Club and the Idle Hour Yacht Club, and has served on numerous charity golf committees. 
   Mrs. Greco Issa contributes time to St. Joseph's Hospital, the Italian American Cultural Center, the Macomb Medical Society, and Toys for Tots. She has also always been very active in volunteering her time and effort to the March of Dimes. Since 1986, she has been involved with the Alexander Macomb Dinner and March of Dimes WalkAmerica. Indeed, due to her personal commitment and contributions to the March of Dimes, Mrs. Greco Issa has become a member of the March of Dimes Southeast Michigan Chapter Board of Directors. 
   There is potential that this will not be the last time members of the Greco family are recognized for their charitable endeavors. Mr. Greco and his wife, Ida Marie, have two daughters, Leticia Greco and Christina Greco Ewald, and one son, Philip S. Greco. They also have one grandchild, Evan Thomas Greco Ewald. Mrs. Greco and her husband, Elias, have three sons: Nicholas P. Krause, Zachary Issa and Alexander Issa. 
   I applaud Mr. Greco and Mrs. Greco Issa for the dedication they have shown toward improving Macomb County. They have turned community service into a family affair, and their efforts have found extraordinary success. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Mr. Philip E. Greco and Mrs. Donna Greco Issa on receiving the 2000 Alexander Macomb Family of the Year Award.

I rise today to recognize Ms. Lillian Adams, who will receive an Alexander Macomb Citizen of the Year Award at a dinner benefitting the March of Dimes on September 27, 2000. 
   Ms. Adams has served as Executive Director of the Sterling Heights Area Chamber of Commerce for the past 24 years, after having held the same position on St. Clair Shores Chamber of Commerce for eight years. Her duties within these organizations have included small business advocacy, service as community ombudsman, and hosting local business cable programs. 
   Ms. Adams is a devoted participant in the Macomb County Community Growth Alliance and the St. Joseph Mercy Community Foundation. She has been an active supporter of the March of Dimes and the Kiwanis Club and serves on the boards of the Otsikita Girl Scouts and the Macomb Symphony Orchestra. 
   Ms. Adams also was a founding member of the Sterling Heights Foundation and the Shelby Township Community Foundation, and a past president of the Utica Community Schools Foundation for Educational Excellence. 
   And, as dedicated as she has been to these many causes, Ms. Adams is even more dedicated to her two sons, Micheal and Brian, and her grandchild, Brigette. 
   I applaud Ms. Adams on the dedication she has demonstrated to Macomb County, and the many successful efforts she has made to improve the quality of life for its citizens. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Ms. Lillian Adams on receiving the 2000 Alexander Macomb Citizen of the Year Award.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, each year, the Southeast Michigan Chapter of the March of Dimes recognizes a select group of individuals whose contributions to the Macomb County, Michigan, community have been invaluable I rise today to recognize the  Honorable Peter J. Maceroni, who will receive an Alexander Macomb Citizen of the Year Award at a dinner benefitting the March of Dimes on September 27, 2000. 
   Judge Maceroni received his Bachelor of Arts Degree from Hillsdale College in 1962, and earned his Juris Doctor degree from Wayne State University Law School in 1965. He was in private practice for 35 years before being elected to the ninth Circuit Court Judgeship in 1990. In 1996, in addition to being reelected to this position, he was appointed to the Michigan Trial Court Assessment Commission by Governor John Engler. 
   As Chief Judge, he not only presides over civil and criminal cases, but is also responsible for supervising the operation of the Court, including the Friend of the Court. His duties in these capacities include developing the annual budget, which he presents to the Macomb County Board of Commissioners. 
   One of Judge Maceroni's most successful initiatives in the Macomb County Circuit Court has been a video arraignment program, which has reduced the cost of transporting prisoners from the jail for arraignment hearings and increased security by having fewer prisoners transported over public roads. 
   Judge Maceroni has served as president of the Macomb County Trial Lawyers Association, president of the Italian American Bar Association, as well as Director of the Macomb County Bar Association. In 1997, he received the Outstanding County Elected Official Award from the Michigan Association of Counties. 
   Outside the realm of the law, Judge Maceroni finds time to enjoy the company of his four children: Patricia, Peter, Jr., Patrick and James. 
   I applaud Judge Maceroni on the dedication he has demonstrated to Macomb County, and the many successful efforts he has made to improve the quality of life for its citizens. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate the Honorable Peter J. Maceroni on receiving a 2000 Alexander Macomb Citizen of the Year Award.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the vote I cast yesterday in support of H.R. 4444, the bill extending permanent normal trading relations to the Peoples' Republic of China. 
   While the vote we cast yesterday was to grant China PNTR, it cannot be viewed separate from the question of China's accession to the WTO. In our negotiations with the Chinese over their entry in the WTO, we agreed to end the annual exercise of renewing NTR and to extend NTR to China permanently. In fact, if we do not grant China PNTR we will be the ones in violation of the WTO's rules when China is ultimately granted entry into the WTO. And, as a result, we will lose access to their markets and the beneficiaries of this will be our trade competitors in Europe, Asia, and South America. Most importantly, we have gained some very important trade concessions in our negotiations with the Chinese over their entry into the WTO, and we stand to gain even greater trade concessions from them once they join the WTO and become subject to its rules and dispute resolution procedures. 
   By extending PNTR and allowing China entry into the WTO, the U.S. can expect to increase exports to China by an estimated $13.9 billion within the first five years. And according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, American farmers will account for $2.2 billion of that increase in exports to China. If our economy is to continue to grow and we are to continue to create more good-paying, skilled jobs so that unemployment remains low and Americans can take home more income, we must expand our economic opportunities. The best way to accomplish that is to find new markets for our products. And the most lucrative new market that exists is China. 
   As our colleague from Texas, Senator PHIL GRAMM, pointed out in a ``Dear Colleague'' letter he circulated earlier this week, things in China are changing significantly, if perhaps not as quickly or as comprehensively as we wish. Senator GRAMM quoted a report on China recently issued by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, in which the observation is made: ``Beijing's billboards no longer spout ideology. They advertise consumer products like Internet service, cell phones, and credit cards.'' There can be little doubt that China is changing. The task left to us to decide is how best to effectuate positive change there. 
   My primary concern, in evaluating how to vote on PNTR and China's accession to the WTO has always been: ``What is in the best interests of Michigan's workers and businesses?'' 
   China was Michigan's 15th largest export market in 1998. That rank has almost certainly risen since then. Michigan's exports to China grew by 25 percent during the 5 years between 1993 and 1998, increasing from $211 million to $264 million. Businesses in the Detroit area accounted for $180 million of those exports in 1998, an 11 percent increase over its 1993 figure. Other areas of Michigan are seeing truly phenomenal growth in trade with China. Exports to China from businesses located in the Flint and Lansing areas grew by more than 84 percent from 1993 to 1998. And exports from Kalamazoo and Battle Creek businesses to China grew by an astounding 353 percent during that same period, according to the U.S. International Trade Administration. 
   The growth in China trade outside of Detroit is due to the surprisingly high number of small and medium-sized businesses in Michigan that are exporting to China. According to the Commerce Department, more than 60 percent of the Michigan firms exporting to China in 1997 were either small or medium-sized companies. Of the 149 small and medium-sized Michigan businesses exporting to Michigan in 1997, as substantial majority of these were small businesses with fewer than 100 employees. This trend extends beyond Michigan as well. Nationwide, not only did small and medium-sized businesses in 1997 comprise 35 percent of all U.S. merchandise exports to China--up from 28 percent in 1992--but this 35 percent share of the Chinese market was higher than the share small and medium-sized businesses had of overall U.S. merchandise exports that year--31 percent.  
   While Michigan's manufacturing sector certainly stands to benefit from passing PNTR and China's accession to the WTO, we must not overlook the tremendous benefits that Michigan farmers also stand to gain from these agreements. Agriculture is Michigan's second largest industry, and exporting is a vital component of the state's agricultural business. Michigan agricultural exports totaled almost $1 billion in 1998, but that figure was down almost $100 million from two years earlier. With increased competition in agriculture at home and abroad from the European Community and major S. American exporters such as Chile, opening up a massive new market such as China would be of tremendous benefit to a state like Michigan that relies so heavily on agriculture production and export. 
   The agreement the U.S. negotiated with China, which includes PNTR, contains significant trade concessions by the Chinese in four areas critical to Michigan agriculture. Michigan exported $240 million worth of soybeans and soybean products in 1998, and China is the world's largest growth market for soybeans. China has agreed to lower tariff rates on soybeans to 3 percent with no quota limits. Michigan is also a large feed grains producer, exporting $163 million worth of feed grains and products in 1998. China has agreed to lower their quota to a nominal 1 percent within an agreed upon import quota schedule. However, that quota grows at a tremendous rate, starting at 4.5 million metric tons and growing to 7.5 million metric tons by 2004. By comparison, China imported less than 250,000 metric tons of corn from all countries in 1998. The circumstances are much the same for two other very important Michigan agriculture products--vegetables and fruit. On vegetables, China's tariff rates are scheduled to drop anywhere from 20 to 60 percent by 2004. With respect to fresh and processed 
   deciduous fruit, China has committed to tariff reductions of up to 75 percent. To a state like Michigan, which is known for its cherries, apples, pears, and peaches, this is a significant breakthrough for our fruit growers. 
   Of course, Mr. President, this is not the end of the story. While many of these tariffs will be substantially reduced and quotas are lifted or expanded considerably, tariffs and quotas will still remain on many U.S. goods--as they in fact will continue to exist on certain goods coming from China into the United States. But once China is a member of the WTO, the U.S. will continue to push to have Chinese trade barriers reduced even further and eliminated altogether. 
   A critical element of this debate that too often gets overlooked is the degree to which our membership in the WTO helps us eliminate unfair trading practices amongst our trading partners. The WTO provides a forum to which we can take trade disputes with our trading partners involving unfair trading practices by them. One of the primary functions of the WTO is to provide procedures to settle trade disputes promptly, eliminating a significant deficiency of the previous GATT system in which the process often dragged out indefinitely. The WTO procedures are inherently more fair and more predictable--and that is to our benefit as the world's largest economy and as the world's foremost promoter of free and fair trade. 
   The United States has filed more complaints to the WTO against other countries--49 of them as of April of this year--than any other WTO member country. The U.S. has also prevailed in 23 of the 25 complaints acted upon up to that time--clear evidence that the WTO is of tremendous assistance to us in getting other countries to stop their unfair trading practices. This is also why we can be confident that once China becomes a member of the WTO that we will be able to further reduce the remaining trade impediments they have against our goods and that we will be able to ensure that they live up to the commitments they have already made to us in exchange for PNTR and our support for them joining the WTO. 
   While I have supported annual renewal of NTR each year I have been in the Senate, I have also been a severe critic of many of China's policies and actions and their human rights record. In 1997, I introduced the China Policy Act, in which I attempted to outline a new paradigm for dealing with the Chinese. Specifically, I felt it was unwise for us to use trade continually as our weapon of first resort each time an issue arose between our two countries, whether it be nuclear non-proliferation and missile sales to rogue nations, religious persecution, repression in Tibet, forced abortion, or threatening gestures towards Taiwan. 
   I feel it unfair to American companies and farmers doing business in China to make them constantly bear the brunt of our efforts to get the Chinese to modify their behavior. I am also concerned about pursuing such a strategy when it would likely result in U.S. companies and farmers losing market share and market access in China to our trade competitors in Europe, Asia, and South America. The China Policy Act legislation I introduced in 1997 essentially said, ``Let us reserve using trade as a weapon only for those occasions when our dispute with China is trade related.'' 
   My China Policy Act took a very tough stand on what I believe was unacceptable behavior by the Chinese in the area of missile sales and nuclear proliferation. In response to China's sale of 60 cruise missiles to Iran, which I viewed as a direct violation of the Iran-Iraq Non-Proliferation Act of 1972, my legislation required the President to impose the sanctions provided for by the 1972 act against China. In addition, because I believed the Chinese sale was so dangerous, my legislation suspended the President's ability to waive those sanctions. 
   I have also taken other steps to thwart China's ability to export dangerous armaments and weapons of mass destruction. I voted for the Cochran amendment to the FY '98 DoD Authorization bill to control the export to China of supercomputers that could be utilized by them in their development of missiles and in exploiting nuclear technology. I also supported the Hutchinson amendment to the FY '99 DoD Authorization bill to study the development of U.S. Theater Missile Defense systems against potential Chinese ballistic missiles. 
   Based on this track record and of my continuing concerns for China's actions in this area, I felt compelled to support the Thompson amendment because I believed it was the wisest approach to dealing with this very real threat to our national security. To those who argued that the Thompson amendment would undermine the very principles upon which PNTR was based, I would counter that Senator THOMPSON made a number of significant modifications to his legislation to address these very concerns. 
   The Senator from Tennessee went to great lengths to ensure that American agriculture would be spared the brunt of any trade actions taken against China. This ensures that our farmers are not unfortunate victims of attempts by U.S. policymakers to punish the Chinese for their behavior in non-trade areas. Senator THOMPSON also gave the President greater flexibility to respond to crises by making sanctions against supplier countries under the act discretionary rather than mandatory. And the evidentiary standard in the legislation for imposing mandatory sanctions on companies identified as proliferators has been raised to give the President discretion in determining whether a company has truly engaged in proliferation activities. 
   So I believe the most problematic areas of Senator THOMPSON's original legislation have been addressed responsibly and that made it worthy of support. While I remain a staunch supporter of PNTR for China and supporting China's accession into the WTO, I simply cannot ignore China's past practices in the area of missile sales to rogue nations and it's role in nuclear proliferation. The U.S. must maintain the ability to confront such aggressive arms practices abroad as a means of protecting its own national security. 
   In conclusion, I am keenly aware of the deeply divided feelings Americans have over the questions of PNTR and China's accession to the WTO. There are few, if any, states in which feelings are more polarized on this subject than in Michigan. I respect the fact that sincere people can and will draw a conclusion different from mine. To those who came to a different conclusion, I say that we here in Congress have promised to pay close attention to the reports  issued by the Congressional-Executive Commission on Human and Labor Rights created in this legislation. If China's behavior does not improve and if they do not abide by the agreements they have signed, I am sure that Congress will respond accordingly. I certainly intend to. 
   As many of my colleagues may know, both my wife and I grew up in union households. Her father was a member of the United Auto Workers. And my father was a UAW member as well. That is not an uncommon situation in a state like Michigan, as you can well imagine, where a significant percentage of the population is employed either by one of the automakers or one of the various supplier companies. But like most Michiganders who grew up in a union household or are currently living in one I know what it's like to see a father or mother come home celebrating a raise or some benefits they had secured in a recently ratified contract. And I also know the pain and stress that goes with layoffs or plant closings, things my state has had all too much experience with in the not too distant past. 
   Many current union workers and their families have come up to me in the past year and said they were scared about what will happen if we pass PNTR and allow China into the WTO. They fear that the Chinese will not live up to the commitments they have made with respect to eliminating trade barriers or that American companies might choose to move their operations overseas leaving workers here unemployed and without any available jobs or careers into which to move. Those are very real fears. And I take those concerns very seriously and to heart. 
   China will open its markets in the very near future. The question is: Will U.S. firms be among those competing for these new markets, competing for a portion of the one billion new consumers that are going to be available in China? Or are we going to cede those new opportunities to our competitors in Europe, Asia, and South America? Likewise, the question is not whether U.S. companies will eventually do business in China. The question is whether it will be on our terms or on China's. Will companies be forced to move over to China in order to avoid high tariffs, quotas on U.S. produced goods, or other restrictions which make it difficult for them to do business there? Or will we attempt to eliminate such barriers to market access now through negotiation, so that U.S. companies can continue to operate here in the States, employing U.S. workers and paying U.S. Taxes, and still export goods and services to China in a competitive environment with our trading competitors? 
   I think when most workers consider the options we face, they will agree that the best course for our nation is to join with the other nations of the world in accepting China into the WTO and attempting to work with the procedures available there to open their markets further and ensure they live up to the commitments they have already made. 
   That is the conclusion to which this Senator has come. That is why I voted for permanent normal trade relations for the Peoples' Republic of China. That is why I support China's accession to the WTO.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in 1982, the United States Department of Education initiated its Blue Ribbon Schools Program. In each year since, the Department has recognized schools throughout the country which excel in all areas of academic leadership, teaching and teacher development, and school curriculum. In other words, Blue Ribbon Schools are recognized because they are the finest public and private secondary schools our Nation has to offer. They are the schools that set the standard for which others strive. I am very proud to report that nine of the 198 Blue Ribbon Schools named by Secretary Richard W. Riley for 1999-2000 are located in the State of Michigan, and I rise today to recognize Byron Center High School in Byron Center, Michigan, one of these nine schools. 
   Over the past eight years, Byron Center High School has transformed itself from a school rooted in the curriculum of the 1950's to one prepared for the constantly changing information age of the 21st Century. A graduate of Byron Center is now technologically, academically, and culturally literate. The key to this transformation has been a shift of focus, as administrators stopped tinkering with curriculum and teaching strategies and rather developed a comprehensive restructuring model, which enabled them to more effectively address the entire educational process that Byron Center students are put through. 
   With the new restructuring model, Byron Center faculty and administrators have focused their efforts on four areas: providing effective guidance to all students by improving and promoting career awareness programs; forming strong partnerships and effective working relationships with local business and community leaders; hiring quality teachers and allowing them to be the leaders in the effort to improve; and constantly monitoring student performance, not only on state and national tests, but also by conducting one year and five year follow up surveys of Byron Center graduates, and collectively employing this information to determine where improvements could occur within Byron Center High School to better prepare students find success in a rapidly changing world. 
   The success of the transformation can clearly be seen in the new Byron Center High School facility, which students and staff moved into the fall of 1998. Dr. Robert Burt, who visited Byron Center to make the assessment for the Blue Ribbon Award, said that administrators ``built the school around a structure of technology,'' which provided him a ``dramatic opportunity to learn about the new age of high schools.'' Indeed, the facility was designed to support the curriculum, teaching strategies and information technology systems that have played such a vital role in the overwhelmingly successful development of Byron Center High School. 
   Mr. President, I applaud the students, parents, faculty and administration of Byron Center High School, for I believe this is an award which speaks more to the effort of a united community than it does to the work of a few individuals. With that having been said, I would like to recognize Dr. William Skilling, the Principal of Byron Center High School, whose dedication to making his school one of the finest in our Nation has been instrumental in creating this community. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Byron Center High School on being named a Blue Ribbon School for 1999-2000, and wish the school continued success in the future.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 125th Anniversary of the Wyandotte, Michigan, Boat Club, which will be celebrated on September 23, 2000. Established in 1875, the club is revered in the annals of rowing, and for 125 years it has been a staple of the Wyandotte community, encouraging the citizens of Southeastern Wayne County to flourish physically, mentally and morally. 
   The Wyandotte Boat Club is located on the Detroit River, approximately 15 miles ``downriver'' of Detroit. It was formed in 1875 when a group of Wyandotte men, led by Mr. John McKnight, officially organized and together purchased a ten-oar barge. The first home of the club was at the foot of Pine Street in a shed behind the summer home of a resident of Wyandotte. And though the club has come a very long way since this time, in a literal manner it has not moved an inch, for on January 14, 1997, the club moved back to the foot of Pine Street, into a state of the art, multi-million dollar facility. 
   The boat club has come to play a very large role in the lives of Wyandotte citizens. Its more than 700 members assist in the coaching, maintenance and administration of the club's activities and regattas. They teach rowing programs to individuals of all ages. Furthermore, in the mid 1940's, the club began to sponsor a program offering rowing to area high school students. In its 50 plus years, the program has now expanded to include elementary and middle school students as well as high school students. The school programs are open to all students and there is no charge to the student or the school for participation. Many of the high school oarsmen who have participated in the program have become known both nationally and internationally as top competitors in the rowing arena. 
   Mr. President, I applaud the members of the Wyandotte Boat Club for the many beneficial things they do for the citizens of Wyandotte on a daily basis. In particular, to sponsor rowing for children of all ages, which not only provides these children with a lifelong hobby, but also helps to teach them some of life's most basic and important lessons. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate the Wyandotte Boat Club on 125 successful years, and wish the group continued success in the future.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 25th Anniversary of The Antique and Classic Boat Society (ACBS), which will be celebrated from September 21-24, 2000, at the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island, Michigan. For 25 years, the ACBS has united individuals with an interest in historic, antique and classic boats, allowing them to share fellowship, information, and experiences. 
   The ACBS is an international organization headquartered on the St. Lawrence River in the Thousand Islands region of Clayton, New York. It currently has 44 chapters worldwide, and a membership of over 6,500 individuals. The organization was founded not only to unite individuals with an interest in antique and classic boats, but also to protect and promote the heritage of boating. It does this through the preservation and restoration of historic boats, as well as by encouraging members to share their love and enjoyment of all aspects of historic, antique and classic boating with both other members and the general public. 
   I think it is important to note here the large role that the State of Michigan has played in the growth and development of the recreational boating industry. Beginning as early as the  1920's, and continuing through the 1970's, the four most recognized American boat builders were headquartered in Michigan: Chris Craft in Algonac; Gar Wood in Marysville; Hacker Craft in Mount Clemens; and Century in Manistee. Thus, I think that it is only right that the 25th Anniversary of the Antique and Classic Boat Society be celebrated in the Water Wonderland State of Michigan. 
   Mr. President, I applaud the ACBS for having grown into the world's largest organization dedicated to the preservation and enjoyment of historic, antique and classic boats, a fact which pays tribute to the many people who have devoted themselves not only to promoting the heritage of boating, but also to promoting the ACBS and the many wonderful things it does to preserve this heritage. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate the Antique and Classic Boat Society on its 25th Anniversary, and wish the organization continued success in the future.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on August 25, 2000, Mrs. Patricia Jankowski of Garden City, Michigan, took office as National President of the Ladies Auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign Wars at the organization's 87th National Convention. On September 23, 2000, there will be a Homecoming celebration in her honor at the Marriott Hotel in the Detroit Renaissance Center, and I rise today to offer my congratulations to Mrs. Jankowski as she returns to Michigan. 
   Mrs. Jankowski is a Life Member of Northville Auxiliary #4012. Since becoming a member of the Ladies Auxiliary to the VFW, she has been actively involved on all levels of the organization. She has served served as Auxiliary President, District #4 President, and in 1990-91 was selected the Outstanding President of the Year in her membership group when she served as State President. 
   On the national level, Mrs. Jankowski has served as National Flag Bearer, National Cancer Aid and Research Director, and National Director for the VFW National Home program. As a member of Blazzette Color Guard for five years, she holds two Bronze and one Silver Medal for competition at National VFW Convention. In 1989, she earned National Aide-de-Camp status for recruiting members. And just last year, as National Senior Vice-President, she represented the Auxiliary on a tour of Europe. 
   Mrs. Jankowski's election to this national office is the highlight of a career dedicated to public service. During her term in office, she will encourage fellow members to raise $3 million for the Auxiliary Cancer Aid and Research Fund for the 13th consecutive year, with her ultimate goal being to top all previous program records. 
   Mr. President, I applaud Mrs. Jankowski for the wonderful work that she has done for the Ladies Auxiliary to the VFW. Her supreme dedication to that cause and her unending desire to help our Nation's veterans is both admirable and inspirational. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Mrs. Jankowski on taking office as National President of the Ladies Auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, and wish her great success as she leads this outstanding organization.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Deputy Chief Charles L. Bidwell of the Brighton, Michigan, Area Fire Department, who will be honored for 50 years of fire service to the City of Brighton at a dinner on September 19, 2000. 
   Deputy Chief Bidwell has been an active or on-call firefighter since September 14, 1950. He spent his entire career with the City of Brighton Fire Department until July 1, 1998, when the City of Brighton Fire Department and the Brighton Township Fire Department merged to form the Brighton Area Fire Department. 
   Deputy Chief Bidwell is retired from the General Motors Proving Grounds in Milford, Michigan. He has held the position of Deputy Chief since 1988, and remains one of the most active members of the Brighton Area Fire Department. For the past decade, he has led the department in alarm response. 
   From June 27, 1994 until January 15, 1995, Mr. Bidwell acted as interim Chief of the City of Brighton Fire Department. He was named the City of Brighton's Firefighter of the Year in 1987, and, at the annual conference of the Michigan State Firemen's Association in Ludington earlier this year, he was selected as Michigan's Firefighter of the Year in honor of this remarkable achievement. 
   Mr. President, I applaud Deputy Chief Bidwell on his extensive firefighting career and his dedication to the City of Brighton. He is one of the State of Michigan's true role models, and I am glad that the City of Brighton and the Brighton Area Fire Department have taken this opportunity to recognize his many contributions. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Deputy Chief Charles L. Bidwell on 50 years of service, and wish him continued success in the future.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 30th birthday of Harbor Tower Apartments in Escanaba, Michigan, which was officially celebrated on July 13, 2000. For thirty years, the presence of Harbor Tower Apartments has enabled the Escanaba Housing Commission, in coalition with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to provide low-income housing to members of the Escanaba community. 
   Harbor Tower, an 18 floor, 175 apartment building, was built in 1970. The official dedication of the building took place on July 13th of that same year, and was attended by Miss America Pamela Anne Eldred. The Harbor Tower Apartments are managed by the Escanaba Housing Commission, a group comprised of five full-time employees and a five member Board of Commissioners appointed by the City Council of Escanaba. 
   To qualify to live in Harbor Tower Apartments, individuals must meet the income guidelines set out by HUD. If they qualify under these guidelines, their rent is determined by their income, with HUD providing subsidy funds. Harbor Tower Apartments is considered a high performer by HUD's PHMAP scoring system. The PHMAP is a grade given to the management and staff on their performance and upkeep of the building. 
   Perhaps the most important element of Harbor Tower Apartments, at least to the Escanaba Housing Commission, is to make residents feel as if they are a part of a community. They can participate in a variety of activities, including a weekly Rosary, monthly church services, a monthly club meeting, a summer picnic, and other special dinners. In addition, membership in the Harbor Tower Club is available to any resident for only $6 per year. The club's activities include a monthly catered dinner and dance, an annual Christmas Bazaar, and special holiday parties. 
   Mr. President, I congratulate all of the people whose hard work over the years has made this 30th birthday possible. It is because of their dedication that quality housing remains an option to Escanaba citizens of all income levels. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I wish the Harbor Tower Apartments continued success in the future.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, from 1950-80, a large part of the Empire, Michigan community revolved around its Air Force Base, and the men and women who not only worked there, but also lived and raised families together in the surrounding community. To commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the opening of the base, as well as the relationships that developed between the families, several former Air Force Airmen have coordinated a reunion for everyone who served during the 30 years the facility was open. The event will occur in Traverse City from September 20-23, and I rise today to recognize the Empire Air Force Station Reunion 2000. 
   Empire Air Force 752 Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron opened in 1950, having become necessary as an outgrowth of the Cold War. The primary mission of the base was to protect nearby metropolitan areas, including Detroit and Chicago, from enemy bombers, as well as to provide assistance to commercial aviation. 
   When the station opened, it was a completely manual operation and thus had over 300 personnel assigned. The first personnel assigned to the base were housed in the Village of Empire. Eventually, in 1956, nine family housing units were completed, and soon thereafter servicemen and their families moved into these units. 
   As the Air Force Base expanded in size, so too did the residential area. Between 1960-62, recreational facilities, including a two-lane bowling center, two recreation courts and a softball field, were completed. These did not serve just to provide the feel of a community, they truly created a community, providing children with places to play together and families with places to congregate with one another. 
   In 1965, the Federal Aviation Administration assumed the maintenance of much of the radar equipment, and with the steady advancement of technology, the FAA ultimately took control of the Air Force Station in 1980. During the many years that the FAA and the Air Force shared the station, the relations between the two groups were congenial, which was a tribute to both parties. 
   The reunion includes many outstanding events. There is a banquet Friday evening at the Park Place Hotel in Traverse City, as well as a hospitality suite at the hotel that will be open from noon on Wednesday, September 20th until noon on Saturday, September 23rd. There is also an open house at the Air Force Base on Saturday, hosted by the FAA. 
   Mr. President, as I extend greetings to all those gathered for the Empire Air Force Reunion, I also congratulate Mr. Don Ostendorf and Mr. Lowell Woodworth, the Reunion Coordinators, on the job they have done putting this reunion together. Their hard work and dedication have surely paid off. On behalf of the entire United States, I hope that everyone enjoys a wonderful four days, and I welcome all those individuals who have left the Wolverine State back home.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in October of 1993, the State of Michigan Family Independence Agency commemorated the first anniversary of its landmark welfare reform initiative, To Strengthen Michigan Families, by naming its first Achiever of the Month. In each month since, the award has been given to an individual who participates in the initiative and has shown outstanding progress toward self-sufficiency and self-improvement. I rise today to recognize Ms. Bobbie Davidson, the recipient of the award for the month of August, 2000. 
   Ms. Davidson is the single mother of two children, ages 8 and 11. She is dyslexic, and because of this feared she was unable to work. Having received ADC/FIP and Medicaid since 1993, in 1999 she applied for SSI. Though she was ultimately denied, while her application was pending Ms. Davidson was referred to Michigan Rehabilitation Services. That agency helped her to enroll in West Shore Community College in order to improve her math and reading skills. 
   With assistance from the Work First and the Project Zero coordinators, Ms. Davidson obtained a job at Burger King in Ludington, Michigan, in March of this year. She continues to be employed there, which has resulted in the closure of her FIP case. 
   As a result of her determination to improve her life, not only for herself but also for her children, Ms. Davidson has become independent of the welfare system. Eventually, she would like to attend culinary school and become a chef. 
   Mr. President, I applaud Ms. Bobbie Davidson on being named Achiever of the Month for August of 2000. It is an honor for which she has worked very hard and that she truly deserves. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Ms. Davidson, and wish her continued success in the future.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 28 individuals with connections to the State of Michigan who will be representing our Nation at the XXVII Olympic Summer Games in Sydney, Australia. While I know that this is a very proud time for them and for their families, it is also a proud time for all Michiganians, and, on behalf of my constituents, I congratulate these 28 men and women on having been selected to coach or to compete as part of the United States Olympic Team. 
   I have many hopes for these individuals, Mr. President. My first hope is that while in Sydney they will do their best not only to bring home a medal, but also to enjoy their experience as Olympians. It goes without saying that it is an incredible honor to be an Olympian, and that these men and women have dedicated a great portion of their lives to attaining this goal, and also to winning a medal. I hope they will remember, however, that a medal is only one of many things they can take away from their time in Australia. 
   Secondly, Mr. President, I hope that as they compete they do not forget the millions and millions of Americans who are offering their support from the other side of the world. More importantly, I hope they do not forget the nearly 10 million Michiganians, myself included, who will be cheering just a little bit harder than the rest of them. 
   My final hope, Mr. President, is that these 28 Olympians achieve above and beyond the goals they have set for themselves and for their teams, whatever these goals might be, and I wish them the best of luck in doing so. With that having been said, I ask to print their names, hometowns, and the sports they will compete in or coach, in the RECORD:  
   Dave Simon, West Bloomfield, Rowing; Todd Martin, Lansing, Tennis; Steven Smith, Detroit, Basketball; Kate Sobrero, Bloomfield Hills, Soccer; Ann Marsh, Royal Oak, Fencing; Shelia Taormina, Livonia, Triathlon; Nick Radkewich, Royal Oak, Triathlon; Teodor Gheorge, Davison, Table Tennis; Jasna Reed, Davison, Table Tennis.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, Medicare, that's what seniors and health care providers in Michigan talked  about with me over the August recess--Medicare. Whether it was prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries, Medicare reimbursement restoration so that health care providers can continue to provide quality health care for beneficiaries, or reining in the excesses in this Administration's crusade to ferret out Medicare fraud and abuse, even where it does not exist, I have heard the message of my constituents, and that is that Medicare needs to be modernized, reformed, and refocused on providing the best health care possible for seniors and the disabled. 
   Nowhere has the national debate on Medicare focused more clearly than on prescription drug costs. The increased reliance on prescription drugs in health care treatments in recent years means seniors are paying a much higher portion of their income on drugs. As new drugs come on the market that allow doctors to treat illnesses without surgery, or even allow them to treat illnesses for the first time, the result is that health care has shifted from inpatient hospital services for surgical treatment to outpatient care that utilizes more, better, and more specific drugs. The result is that while per unit costs of drugs are expected to increase by an average of 3.2 percent over the next five years, overall drug expenditures are expected to rise by almost 14.5 percent per year as the number of prescriptions per senior shoots up by more than 20 percent. 
   But Medicare, developed in the late 1960's, and little changed since then, is still geared primarily towards the antiquated focus on intensive, inpatient care, and continues to miss the fundamental shift towards modern care techniques, including prescription drugs. Comprehensive Medicare reform, such as that outlined in the recommendations of the Bipartisan National Commission on the Future of Medicare that embodies choice, competition, and modernization, would allow Medicare to continue its guarantee of health coverage, while providing the type of health coverage that a modern senior needs. Unfortunately, apparently due to the election cycle games of this Administration, the necessary super-majority could not be mustered to report these proposals to Congress. So, America's seniors continue to be denied without a modern Medicare system, including prescription drug coverage. 
   But these political realities do not lessen the immediacy of the problem, nor the need for this Congress to move now on providing a prescription drug benefit. I believe we must move on passing a prescription drug coverage plan for Medicare seniors, and pass it now. I hear the cry of my colleagues who say this will take the wind out of the sails for needed overall Medicare reform, but that assumes comprehensive reform is possible during this session of Congress. Given the politically charged nature of this election, and the fact that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to find new excuses every week for why they can't vote for even the most non-controversial of the appropriations bills, I doubt that will happen. In the short term, Medicare will remain solvent and will be able to provide adequate medical care for seniors. However, Michigan seniors need prescription drug coverage as soon as possible, and I intend to see that happen. 
   Twice this summer, once on my own, and once with a bipartisan group of 12 other Senators, I have called upon the Senate Leadership to bring to the Senate floor a meaningful prescription drug plan that will not only cover these increasingly expensive drugs, but also ensure that such a plan does not impose additional costs on our seniors, additional costs that would wipe out any savings the coverage would provide. It makes little sense to me to establish a prescription drug plan that pays for 50 percent, or even 100 percent, of a senior's drug expenses, which average about $550 per year, but then saddle them with $600 in new premiums, and have them end up with greater out-of-pocket expenses than if they never had the coverage in the first place. That's not what I hear Michigan seniors say they want in a prescription drug plan. No, what I hear them say is that they want a prescription drug plan that will actually reduce their out-of-pocket expenses, allow them the most freedom and choice in determining their own coverage, and protect them from unexpectedly high drug expenses, expenses that can make their daily choice one between food and drugs. 
   That's why I am so excited about the prescription drug plan on which I have been working with Senators HAGEL and MCCAIN as well as the other cosponsors, the Medicare Rx Drug Discount and Security Act of 2000, S. 2836. Of all the plans we have seen presented before this and the other Chamber, I believe this bill most directly addresses the major issues of prescription drug coverage. First, unlike any other bill currently before Congress, it provides broad and deep discounts for prescription drugs, on average 30-39 percent discounts, through multiple, competing drug discount buying plans. Much has been made over the last few years about the relative price difference American seniors pay for their prescription drugs as compared to those paid by their Canadian counterparts, where prices are fixed by the Government. But those comparisons are of the retail price. When the prices paid by Canadian seniors are compared to the prices paid by American seniors that are in group buying plans, the American senior pays less. 
   And these plans are not uncommon. In fact, 71 percent of all prescription drugs paid for by third parties have been administered by these group buying plans, such as with the Michigan National Guard's drug insurance coverage plan. Furthermore, many group buying plans are offered outside of insurance programs, such as those innovative programs being offered by Macomb and Wayne Counties in Michigan, where price savings of as much as 70 percent on drugs are obtained. But as I've pointed out before, Medicare beneficiaries can't take advantage of these savings because the Medicare system still employs the antiquated priorities and structures of the days in which it was born. 
   For the average American senior with drug expenses of about $670 per year, in 2002, our plan would provide an immediate savings of $235 per year. And, depending upon the drugs they have prescribed, savings could be as high as 70-85 percent for the more common drugs where usage is 
   higher and competing brands more plentiful. Furthermore, there would be even greater market pressure for lower prices under our plan because multiple, competing drug discount plans would be available from which seniors could choose. If the particular drugs a senior uses were cheaper under another plan, that senior could shift over to that plan, and enjoy those better discounts. By allowing the market to drive down prices we can provide robust market price discounts that no other plan before Congress can beat, and which are substantially better than those offered under almost every Democrat plan which I've seen. In fact, because almost every plan that has been offered by Democrats in both the Senate and the House allows for only a single entity to control the price discounting for Medicare seniors, there will be little competitive pressure to pass along savings to Senior consumers, and little incentive to even try to get prices down. The Congressional Budget Office recognized this during their analysis of the President's prescription drug proposal, and determined that drug discounts would only average 12.5 percent, or about a third of those that would be seen under the Hagel-Abraham plan. 
   But reducing the price of drugs is only half of the prescription drug equation. The other half is ensuring that Medicare provides the needed protections for Seniors against expensive drug treatments that may force them to decide between putting bread on the table or taking a life-saving drug. And the Hagel-Abraham bill does just that with the best catastrophic drug coverage of any bill before Congress. By tiering the coverage to income, we assure all seniors they will not be financially devastated by drug expenses for some of the new treatments that can approach $500 per month. 
   Here is how the prescription drug costs caps break down under the Hagel-Abraham plan. Seniors earning less than 200 percent of poverty, $16,700 for a single and $22,500 for a couple, would pay no more than $1,200 annually. All drug expenses after that would be covered by the Federal Government. For those seniors that earn more than that, but below 400 percent of poverty, $33,400 for singles and $45,000 for couples, costs  would be limited to $2,500 annually. And Seniors above 400 percent of the poverty level, up to $100,000 for singles and $200,000 for couples, would pay no more than $5,000 annually. Although some of my colleagues may believe that prescription drug insurance should be available to all Medicare beneficiaries, and that the government should subsidize the insurance of even the wealthiest Americans, I don't think it makes sense to subsidize the drug expenditures for those single seniors making more than $100,000, and those couples making more than $200,000, especially considering they have much easier access to private insurance coverage. 
   What makes this proposal particularly attractive, in my opinion, is that it does not require seniors to pay hundreds of dollars in new Medicare premiums, premiums that could be greater than their actual drug expenses. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office has determined that when the President's prescription drug proposal is fully implemented, seniors will have to pay more almost $600 per year in new Medicare premiums, on top of the $88 per month they will have to pay for their existing Part B Medicare coverage. I can't see how that can be a good deal for America's seniors. CBO also recently scored the drug proposal offered by Senator ROBB as an amendment to the Senate's Labor-HHS Appropriations Bill. That proposal would, according to CBO, increase Medicare's financing gap between revenues and outlays by 25 percent, while imposing new premiums of $80 per month, or $960 per year! Forcing America's seniors to pay almost $1,000 per year, just to have the privilege of participating in this big-government drug program, is wrong, flat-out wrong. And it will most likely wipe out any savings they would gain from the coverage in the first place. I believe by the time these plans were fully implemented, Michigan seniors would be wishing for the ``good ol' days'' where the government wasn't providing them such ``great'' coverage that forced them to spend more than they did before. 
   I am not merely railing against these plans because they represent a big-government view of legislating. No, it's that I am deeply concerned with the record of the Health Care Financing Administration and its existing prescription drug programs. The fact of the matter is that HCFA's centralized, top-down, bureaucratic method of providing it's current inpatient drug benefit has led to drug rationing, cutbacks in coverage, and price fixing. Just recently this Administration announced that it intends to cut back coverage of cancer-fighting drugs administered in doctors' offices and set the price for those drugs by Executive fiat, even while it says that it's proposed additional drug coverage will not result in these same things. There is no escaping the fact that when the government controls all aspects of prescription drug insurance the quality of care and access are placed in jeopardy. It has been happening in Canada and we cannot allow that to happen to whatever new prescription drug coverage we provide. 
   But we are taking action to stop the Administration's attempts to cut back cancer drug coverage for sick seniors. I am cosponsoring with Senator ASHCROFT the Cancer Care Preservation Act, which will guarantee that HCFA cannot implement any reductions in Medicare reimbursements for outpatient cancer treatment unless those changes are developed in conjunction with the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and representatives of the cancer care community, provides for appropriate payment rates for outpatient cancer therapy services, and is specifically authorized by an act of Congress. Furthermore, I am sending a letter to the President of the United States today, calling upon him to rescind HCFA's plan until such time as such changes can be fully examined by the cancer care community and Congress. To think that the Medicare system could stop covering the most effective cancer treatments simply by it's own edict should be a clear warning to all of my colleagues on the dangers in having a single agency control the access to our senior's prescription drugs. 
   And that leads me to the second problem I've been hearing about in Michigan 
   the issue of how HCFA and this Administration manage Medicare, especially with regard to reimbursement rates. When I first came to the Senate, Medicare was going broke quickly, and was bound for bankruptcy by 2001. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 implemented necessary changes to contain the growth in Medicare spending to extend the system's solvency until 2015, giving us time to implement necessary structural and market-based reforms in Medicare, reforms that can make the program viable for generations to come. But those modest reductions in the rate of growth for Medicare have become full-blown cuts in the face of this Administration's refusal to spend the money Congress has authorized them to spend. 
   In fact, this Administration has short-changed Medicare by $37 billion in the last two years. The Congressional Budget Office's July 2000 Budget Projection update indicates that Medicare spending this year will be $14 billion below what Congress budgeted, following last year's spending by the Administration of only $209 billion for Medicare versus the $232 billion Congress provided. The fact of the matter, is that most reimbursement rates are set by the Administration and HCFA, and this Administration has repeatedly refused to spend the money on Medicare that Congress has given them. In fact, while the original Balanced Budget Act of 1997 was expected to reduce Medicare growth by $103 billion between 1998 and 2002, this Administration's relentless ratcheting down of reimbursements over and above that authorized by Congress has pushed those cuts to almost $250 billion. And between 2001 and 2005, the cuts are expected to be even more dramatic, climbing from $163 billion to $457 billion, 280 percent greater than Congress originally intended. 
   The consequences for Michigan's health care industry are devastating. According to the March 2000 Michigan Health and Hospital Association report, ``The Declining State of Michigan Hospitals'' HCFA's implementation of BBA 97 has cost Michigan hospitals an average of $8.5 million each. As a result, 68 percent of the hospitals have been forced to eliminate at least one service, ranging from urgent care and rural health clinics, to rehabilitation and pain management centers, to screening and preventative health services. Forty-five percent of all the hospitals have eliminated at least two of the services, and more than half of those who haven't yet eliminated services yet are considering it for 2000. Previous reports have put the statewide total lost hospital revenue at $2.5 billion, or just over $13.5 million per hospital. 
   But hospitals are not the only health care provider hit by the effects of BBA 97 and the voracious appetite of HCFA bureaucrats. Home Heath Care agencies have been particularly hard hit by HCFA policies seemingly intent on driving them all out of business. Home health care spending was expected to grow by $2 billion even after BBA 97 cost containment measures, but have dropped by $9 billion, a 54 percent drop in just two years. In fact, the number of home health care claims have dropped by 50 percent in just two years, and the average payment per patient lowered by 38.5 percent, far lower than originally projected with BBA 97. CBO stated this unexpected drop in reimbursements as the primary reason that total Medicare spending dropped last year. Over the four years covered by BBA 97, CBO now expects home health care spending to be reduced by $69 billion, over four times the original $16 billion that they originally estimated. Like hospitals, home health care has been decimated. Over 2,500 home health agencies have closed or stopped serving Medicare patients. Moreover, HCFA estimates that nearly 900,000 fewer home health patients received services in 1999 than in 1997. 
   Finally, I think we need to look at the effects of this Administration's policies on reimbursements to skilled nursing facilities. Under BBA 97, the rate of growth for skilled nursing facility reimbursements was to be slowed by $19.8 billion between 1998 and 2004. However, since that original projection, reimbursements are now expected to fall by an additional $15.8 billion. This even takes into account the $2 billion in reimbursement restorations provided by the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999. For Michigan, the numbers are equally disconcerting.  Michigan has lost $643 million in nursing facility reimbursements, over and above those projected with BBA 97, over 75 percent more than originally projected. Is it any wonder then, that 25 percent of all skilled nursing facilities serving Medicare patients are operating in bankruptcy and that why the number one problem for hospital discharge coordinators is that they can't find nursing facilities for their patients needing them? 
   We have provided some important reimbursement relief in the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999. But it was only a first step and by no means a complete response to the Administration's policies. While Medicare reimbursements over the next five years are projected to be cut by $295 billion more than originally projected, BBRA 99 only restored about $16 billion of that, or less than 5 percent of the additional cuts. Containing the growth of Medicare was necessary to ensure Medicare did not go bankrupt, but this continuous, unsustainable ratcheting down of reimbursements is simply wrong, and we must reverse it now. That is why this body must bring to the floor real, substantive, Medicare reimbursement restoration legislation. And we must do it very soon. We cannot wait until next Congress, or even until next month. We must do it now. Ensuring Medicare's fiscal solvency on the backs of Medicare providers is not only wrong, but counterproductive, and will ultimately lead to the insolvency of Medicare's health care guarantees as we know it. 
   I have been working very hard to provide specific reimbursement relief for Michigan's health care providers. First, Senator HUTCHISON of Texas and I have been fighting for two years now to improve the inpatient reimbursements for hospitals. Our American Hospital Preservation Acts of 1999 and 2000 would do just that. This year's version will restore the entirety of the Market Basket Indicator inflation adjustment for inpatient hospital reimbursement rates, returning over $6.9 billion 
   to hospitals over the next five years, and $13.5 billion over the next 10. That will in turn mean more than $536 million in increased reimbursements for Michigan hospitals over the next ten years, or more than $3.4 million per hospital. 
   Likewise, I have joined 53 of my colleagues in cosponsoring S. 2365, the Home Health Payment Fairness Act to eliminate the automatic 15 percent reduction to home health payments currently scheduled to go into effect on October 1, 2001. The home health care industry cannot survive with the current reimbursement reductions, let alone another 15 percent across-the-board cut. Finally, I am working closely with a number of my colleagues to craft a bill that will provide for adequate nursing home reimbursements through a refinement of the inflation adjustment factors. We believe appropriate legislation will be available this week or next, and if any of my colleagues are interested in joining this effort, I encourage them to contact me immediately. 
   The third concern I hear from Michiganians about Medicare, is that even with the steps we have taken to improve its financial standing and the quality of care, it is still headed towards bankruptcy in the very near future. Seniors in Michigan are scared, scared that they will lose their Medicare benefits because we cannot modernize Medicare so that it will stay solvent for generations to come. But it looks like things are getting better with Medicare and that at least in the short term, we have the fiscal breathing room to make the necessary changes to avoid a train wreck down the way. 
   This summer the Board of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund issued a correction to their 2000 Annual Report. In it, the Trustees reported that the financial projections were more favorable than those made in 1999, that the Trust Fund income exceeded expenditures for the second year in a row, and that the Fund now met the Trustees' test of short-range financial adequacy. In fact, income is now projected to continue to exceed expenditures for the next 17 years, a substantial increase over previous estimates. 
   Now 2017 is still too soon for us to rest in our efforts to ensure the permanent solvency of Medicare through market-based modernization and reform, as well as provide seniors' access to the full spectrum of health care options. First, we need to shift Medicare from a centrally-controlled government system to a market-based system, one that maximizes choice and can best respond to changing medical care needs, such as recommended by the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. 
   Second, to ensure that we don't raid the Medicare Trust Funds to pay for non-Medicare spending, as repeatedly proposed by this Administration, we need to wall off the Medicare Trust Fund surpluses so that they can only be used for Medicare. I have been proud to vote for a Medicare lockbox proposal. But recent analysis by conservative groups such as the Heritage Foundation, and liberal groups such as the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities have raised serious questions about the efficacy of each of these proposals, and so I will be working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, especially my fellow Budget Committee Members, to draft a Medicare lockbox that not only protects the Medicare surpluses, but also enhances our ability to provide for the long-term solvency of the system. Even after providing for a new prescription drug benefit, and after providing for healthier reimbursements for health care providers, we will still have about $110 billion in Medicare surpluses available to fund this reform. Given that the Bipartisan Medicare Commission's reform proposal would actually end up costing less than the current Medicare system through competition and choice, I believe this is more than adequate to fix our problems with Medicare. Regardless, the Medicare lockbox will ensure those surpluses are still there when the need comes for any funds to finance reform. 
   Third, I believe we need to allow Americans to prepare for their retirement health care needs outside of Medicare through Medical Savings Accounts, or MSAs, long-term care insurance, and existing health care benefit flexibility. Today's able-bodied workers will be tomorrow's seniors, and to the extent that we can set in motion now provisions that will allow them more choices, more options, and more access to quality health care, the healthier our entire retirement health care system will be, including Medicare. As we all know, MSAs are a market-based alternative for quality health care. They offer maximum flexibility for the self-employed, employees, and employers while reducing the out-of-pocket cost of insurance. MSAs are an alternative health insurance plan with real cost-control benefits for the millions of Americans who have been forced into managed care and feel they have lost control of their health care decisions. By establishing these MSAs now, tomorrow's seniors will have sizable balances available in their retirement years to supplement whatever coverage is available under Medicare. To that end, I believe we should make MSAs permanent and affordable by removing eligibility restrictions, including allowing Federal employees to have MSAs, lowering the minimum deductible, permitting both employer and employee MSA contributions, and allowing MSAs in cafeteria plans. Furthermore, I believe we should also waive the 15 percent penalty tax on non-medical distributions if the remaining balance at least equals the plan deductible. 
   As for long-term care insurance, I support legislation phasing-in 100 percent deductibility of long-term care insurance premiums, when they are not substantially subsidized by an employer. Under my plan, individuals age 60 and older would not be subject to such a phase-in period, and would qualify for 100 percent deductibility immediately. I believe we should also allow long-term care insurance to be offered as a cafeteria plan benefit. By providing for more accessible long-term care options, retirees can build insurance against the catastrophic expenses of long-term home and nursing facility care that is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain under Medicare. 
   Finally, we should allow for greater health insurance plan flexibility, especially with regards to the multipurpose Flexible Spending Accounts. Flexible Spending Accounts and cafeteria plans have become a popular means of providing health benefits to employees, but under current law, 
   unused benefits are forfeited. This ``use it or lose it''  rule has limited the appeal of these plans as well as forfeiting substantial amounts of money that could be available for retirement health care needs. I support legislation which will allow transferring up to $500 in unused Flexible Spending Account balances from one year to the next, or to roll-over that amount into an IRA, 401(k) retirement plan, or a Medical Savings Account. 
   All of these proposals will help retirees better plan for and provide for their health care needs. But regardless of these supplemental programs, Medicare will still be at the base of any retirees health care program. That's why it's even more heartening to see in the corrected Medicare Trustees' report that some of the more drastic measures we once thought would be required are no longer necessary to keep Medicare sound. For example, in 1997, when Medicare was on the verge of bankruptcy by 2001, many of us, on a bipartisan basis, voted in favor of a limited move to raise the retirement age for Medicare eligibility from 65 to 67 years of age starting in 2003 and phased-in over the following twenty-four years. We did that on a near emergency basis, because the Medicare system was threatened. But I noted at the time, if the situation improved, such a change would not be necessary. In my opinion, that is now the case, and that kind of approach no longer needs to be considered in light of the improved financial condition of Medicare and the emergence of significant Medicare trust fund surpluses. 
   In fact, at the time I cast my vote on this question, I entered into the RECORD on July 14, 1997, a number of prerequisites which I indicated would have to be met in order for me to support the actual implementation of the proposal. In that none of these prerequisites--the development of a viable system for low- and middle-income seniors to obtain and maintain affordable health care until eligible for Medicare, as well as concurrence by the National Bipartisan Medicare Commission on the Future of Medicare on raising the eligibility age--have been addressed in the two to three year time-frame that I set forth in my statement, I have withdrawn my support for raising the eligibility age. I no longer believe this change is necessary in light of the improved financial status of Medicare, or prudent in light of the failure of its sponsors to adequately address the concerns I raised. 
   Finally, the fourth Medicare issue on which I have been inundated with complaints is how hard it is to navigate the regulatory complexity of the Medicare system. I have heard from doctors and hospital administrators, home health care agencies and skilled nursing facilities, about how even a simple mistake, or even a difference of opinion, can embroil them in legal controversies that take years to resolve, and many times more in legal bills than the amount of the originally contested bill. HCFA has now produced over 111,000 pages of Medicare regulations, three times the size of the incredibly complex Internal Revenue Code. These regulations make it nearly impossible to operate efficiently, and make simple administrative errors appear to be criminal fraud. In fact, on August 10th, 1998, Dr. Robert Walker, president emeritus of the Mayo Foundation, told the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, ``The public has been led to believe that the, Medicare, program is riddled with fraud, when in reality, complexity is the root of the problem. This has contributed to the continuing erosion in public confidence in our health care system. We must all have zero tolerance for real fraud, but differences in interpretation and honest mistakes are not fraud.'' 
   Recently, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons conducted a survey of its members as to the impact of HCFA regulations on their ability to treat patients. They found that it costs on average 27 percent more to process a Medicare claim as it does a private health insurer claim, and that doctors and their staffs spend more than a fifth of their time on Medicare compliance issues. Furthermore, more than half of all doctors say they will retire from active patient care at a younger age because of ``increased hassles with Medicare.'' This is bad news for Medicare seniors, as further pointed out by the survey. Almost a quarter of all doctors are no longer accepting new Medicare patients, and of those that do, 34 percent are restricting services to those patients, such as difficult surgical procedures or comprehensive medical work-ups. Last, these are not changes simply to stop previously fraudulent activity. Thirty-eight percent of all doctors surveyed stated they submitted Medicare claims that they knew were for less than for which they were entitled, or ``downcoding'' in the Medicare regulatory parlance, but did not want to subject themselves to the potential of erroneous HCFA reviews and claim denials. Similar ``downcoding'' results have been found with hospitals who deny patients the most appropriate regimen of care in complex cases because they do not believe they will be fully reimbursed by Medicare if they submit such a complex care claim. 
   That is why on July 27, I introduced S. 2999, the Health Care Providers Bill of Rights, a bill aimed at addressing the numerous regulatory and law enforcement abuses in the Medicare system that have brought to my attention by Michigan health care providers. This bill addresses many of the specific regulatory ``hassles'' experienced by doctors and providers everyday as they try to provide the best possible care for our Seniors. 
   The bill is divided into six titles: Title I--Reform of HCFA Regulatory Process; Title II--Reform of Appeals Process; Title III--Reform of Overpayment Procedure; Title IV--Reform of Voluntary Disclosure Procedure; Title V--Criminal Law Enforcement Reforms; and Title VI--Provider Compliance Education. 
   Provisions that should be of particular interest to my colleagues are those that rescind HCFA's ability to withhold future reimbursements in order to offset alleged prior underpayments, a strict 180 day time line for completion of the Medicare administrative appeals cases, placing program participation terminations and suspensions in abeyance while appeals are pending, prohibiting the use of sample audit results to reduce future reimbursement rates, stopping overpayment collections while appeals are pending, and establishing voluntary disclosure procedures 
   that also bring the Department of Justice and U.S. Attorneys into the process, as well as providing safe harbor from prosecution for those that enter into and abide by the voluntary disclosure requirements. 
   Some further provisions that were specifically recommended by providers include requiring HCFA, fiscal intermediaries, and carriers to all spend a portion of their Medicare funds on provider education, requiring them to provide legally binding advisory opinions on Medicare coverage, billing, documentation, coding, and cost reporting requirements, as well as extending the current anti-kickback, civil monetary penalty, and physician self-referral advisory opinion requirements that are set to expire August 21st of this year.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. I am continuing to reach out to additional organizations to garner their support, as well as to my colleagues in the Senate to join Senators COCHRAN of Mississippi and Senator GRAMS of Minnesota as cosponsors. Furthermore, Members of the other body will soon introduce companion legislation to S. 2999 in the hope that we can incorporate these necessary reforms in a Medicare reimbursement restoration bill or other reform legislation that may pass this Congress. Finally, I am joining Senator CRAIG in calling on the Senate Finance Committee to hold immediate hearings on this legislation, and the broader issue of HCFA regulatory complexity. With this legislation, I believe we can break down one of the primary obstacles to assuring access to quality health care in this country, the seemingly unfettered abuses of Medicare bureaucrats against doctors and providers alike. I urge my colleagues to join me on this important measure. 
   I believe I have laid out a comprehensive and sensible policy for ensuring the continued viability of Medicare. Medicare has provided millions of seniors access to quality health care where otherwise they would go without. But more must be done, and must be done soon: we must modernize Medicare so that it provides for coverage of prescription drug expenses; we must improve reimbursements to providers so that reform and cost containment does not come at the expense of the very access to health care Medicare is trying to provide; we must implement comprehensive Medicare reform that improves beneficiaries choices in their health care decisions, mirrors the health care needs of the modern senior, and is fiscally sound for generations to come; and we must rein in the abusive and incredibly complex bureaucratic behemoth that has crippled health care providers' ability to operate efficiently in the Medicare system. We can do all of this, but time is running very short. Our seniors need these changes, and the time to act is now.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Farmington Public School District of Farmington, Michigan, for its outstanding achievement in music education. It was ranked number one (along with Coppell, Texas) on the list of 100 best communities in America for school music programs. This is a very special honor which emphasizes the importance of arts education to the lives of our children. 
   The rankings were the result of a first-ever nationwide survey of more than 5,800 public schools and independent teachers, district administrators, school board members, parents, and community leaders representing communities in all 50 states. The web-based survey assessed many aspects of music education, such as funding, participation, student-teacher ratios, and quality of facilities. The results indicate that superior programs exist both in areas that possess a wealth of monetary and material resources, as well as in those that must rely on more innovative means of funding and implementing ambitious educational endeavors. The key element of success, found in each of the top 100 communities, is the dedication and support of parents, teachers, school decision-makers, and community leaders. This landmark survey highlights the efforts of people who truly value quality music education and strive to make it a reality for today's youth. 
   The partnership that sponsored the study was comprised of the country's top organizations devoted to music and learning. National School Boards Association President, Clarice Chambers, commented on the significance of the results: ``We already know that students who participate in music programs tend to be high achievers. Now we can use the data generated by this survey to identify the common characteristics of exemplary music programs. This information will be invaluable to school boards and communities as they go about the work of raising student achievement in their own school districts.'' Scientific research has revealed the impact of music education on a child's cognitive abilities, self-discipline, communication, and teamwork skills. The self-confidence gained through artistic accomplishment encourages kids to avoid drugs and alcohol and channel their energy into positive activities. Farmington's musical education program will serve as a model for shaping young lives in school districts across the nation. 
   I applaud the City of Farmington for the wonderful music education program that it has established. It has truly earned its status as America's best place for music education, and I am sure will be a leader in the cultivation of musical talent for many years. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate the City of  Farmington, and wish the music education program continued success in the future.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise to join with the Senator from Arizona, the Senator from Massachusetts, and the Senator from California in introducing the Consumer Privacy Enhancement Act. This legislation will provide Americans with some basic--but critically important--protections for their personal information when they are online. 
   Privacy has always been a very serious issue to American citizens. It is a concept enshrined in our Bill of Rights. As persons from all walks of life become increasingly reliant on computers and the Internet to perform everyday tasks, it is incumbent upon policymakers to ensure that adequate privacy protections exist for consumers. We must ensure that our laws evolve along with technology and continue to provide effective privacy protection for consumers surfing the World Wide Web and using the Internet for commercial activities. 
   The American people are letting it be known that they have mounting concerns about their vulnerability in this digital age. They are very concerned about the advent of this new high-tech era we've entered and the new threats it potentially poses to our personal privacy. And I believe there is a consensus building in Congress to begin to tackle the question of ensuring adequate privacy protections for individuals using the Internet. 
   Whether we can find a similar consensus on a particular legislative proposal remains to be seen. However, I think it is imperative that we begin to address this topic now and not simply wait until Congress reconvenes next year before we take the issue up. So I have joined my colleagues here in introducing legislation that I think accomplishes several important objectives. 
   The most important provision, I believe, is its most elemental concept: We require that before consumers are asked to provide personal information about themselves, they must be given an opportunity to review the website's privacy policy in order to learn how their information will be utilized. While many websites have privacy policies, including the vast majority of those websites receiving the most traffic, there are still many websites out there that do not offer privacy policies or adequate protections for consumers. 
   In addition, many of the privacy policies that do exist are very lengthy and often quite confusing to consumers. There are pages and pages of ambiguous legalese and often seemingly contradictory claims about how protected your information truly is. So our bill also calls on the Federal Trade Commission to ensure that privacy policies  are ``clear, conspicuous, and easily understood,'' and that any consent mechanisms shall be ``easy to use, easily accessible, and shall be available online.'' 
   Finally, this legislation recognizes the importance of allowing the Internet industry to continue to promote greater self-regulation and to develop new technology means for to continue to evolve and to help us address legitimate consumer privacy concerns. There have been several initiatives undertaken by industry leaders to get websites to develop and post privacy policies and to give consumers the option of when to provide information and for what uses. This legislation is designed to allow such efforts to continue and to provide for technological advances in the area of privacy to benefit consumers. For instance, Ford and other companies have been participating in the Privacy Leadership Initiative whereby companies engaged online are working to establish industry guidelines and protocols for protecting consumers privacy. Nothing we do here today should inhibit such industry efforts. 
   So with those critical features addressed, I believe the legislation we introduce today will be an important stepping stone along the path of ensuring that Americans can be confident of having their personal information will be protected when they go online. 
   I urge my colleagues to review this legislation and to support our efforts to protect consumers against unwarranted intrusions into their personal privacy when they are using their computers and surfing the Internet. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr. Daniel C. Wall, who will leave his elected position as Commander of The Sons of The American Legion, Detachment of Michigan, in August. For the last year, Mr. Wall has led the Michigan Detachment of the S.A.L. with wisdom and with grace, and has used his time in this position to aid the Veterans of the United States Armed Forces in an exemplary fashion. 
   Mr. Wall has served in the Sons of The American Legion for many years, and holds a Life Membership card from Robert A. Demars Sons of The American Legion Squadron 67 of Lincoln Park, Michigan. During his time as a member, he has held many offices within the S.A.L., including all offices at the Squadron level; District Commander, Adjutant, and others; State Commander, Adjutant, and Zone 1 Commander. 
   Mr. Wall was elected to serve as the State of Michigan Commander in 1999. During his time in the position, Mr. Wall focused much of his attention upon the education of his fellow members, so that they might know more about the purpose, programs, awards, officer duties and the benefits of their organization. He believed that this would not only help to recruit new members, but would also give current members a better appreciation for the many beneficial things that the S.A.L. does on a daily basis. 
   As Commander, Mr. Wall has also presided over the many efforts of the S.A.L. in the State of Michigan, including assisting local posts in their activities, initiating programs for Veterans, volunteering at V.A. homes and hospitals, and fundraising. In 1999, the S.A.L. raised over $514,000 for V.A. homes and hospitals, and over $181,000 for the American Legion Child Welfare Foundation. In addition, Mr. Wall has served as a member of national S.A.L. committees. 
   I applaud Mr. Daniel C. Wall on the job he has done as State of Michigan Commander of the Sons of the American Legion. He has dedicated much of his life to improving the lives of the Veterans of our great Nation, and for this he is to be commended. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I thank Mr. Wall for his dedication, and wish him continued success in the future.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in October of 1993, the State of Michigan Family Independence Agency commemorated the first anniversary of its landmark welfare reform initiative, ``To Strengthen Michigan Families,'' by naming its first Achiever of the Month. In each month since, the award has been given to an individual who participates in the initiative and has shown outstanding progress toward self-sufficiency. I rise today to recognize Ms. Lorie Fooce, the recipient of the award for the month of July, 2000. 
   Ms. Fooce, a single mother, applied for assistance in August, 1994, in order to provide for her family. She was approved for ACD/FIP, food stamps, and Medicaid. At the time, Ms. Fooce lacked the necessary job skills and experience to maintain a steady, sufficient income. However, within that same month, she took the initiative to enroll in Certified Nurses Aid (C.N.A.) training through Work First. 
   Ms. Fooce was able to complete the training and was subsequently hired by Gogebic Medical Care. With the help of Work First, which paid for the C.N.A. training, testing fees, transportation, and uniforms, she has become a valued employee at Gogebic. 
   Ms. Fooce's FIP case closed in May, 1999. In order to best care for her family, she currently receives food stamps, Medicaid, and day care assistance to supplement her earnings. 
   I applaud Ms. Lorie Fooce for being named Achiever of the Month for July of 2000. She has shown a sincere dedication to her job and to the goals of self-improvement and self-sufficiency, and the progress she has made shows both great effort and great determination. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Ms. Fooce, and wish her continued success in the future.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Rabbi Steven Weil, who on August 20, 2000, will be honored for over six years of faithful service at Young Israel of Oak Park, the largest Orthodox synagogue in Michigan. Rabbi Weil will soon move to the Los Angeles area to pursue a large pulpit position in another Orthodox synagogue, and this occasion provides the Orthodox Jewish Community of Detroit with an opportunity not only to say good-bye to Rabbi Weil, but also to thank him for the wonderful work he has done during the past six years. 
   Under the guidance of Rabbi Weil, the congregation of Young Israel doubled in size, an accomplishment which can be directly attributed to his devotion to spreading the tenets of his faith. In addition to developing a lecture and discussion series within his own congregation, he and his wife, Yael, were frequent lecturers at the Agency for Jewish Education and at the Jewish Community Center. He also had an on-going cable television series on the topic of Jewish history. 
   Rabbi Weil had a vision of creating cohesiveness within the Jewish community and developing future Jewish leadership. He was able to achieve this goal by enacting several different programs, including a trip to Israel and Prague for young Jewish Orthodox, Conservative and Reform couples, as well as a March of the Living Youth Unity Mission. He also headed the Metropolitan Detroit Federation Young  Leadership Cabinet, an organization which tutors the future leaders of the Detroit Jewish community. 
   Rabbi Weil served on the boards of Yad Ezra, the Detroit kosher food bank, the Jewish Apartments and Services and the Neighborhood project. He was one of eight rabbis in North America selected to be a L.E.A.D fellow, with the responsibility of leading Orthodox rabbis into the 21st century. He was also on the executive committee of the Council of Orthodox rabbis in Detroit and of the National Rabbinical Council of America. 
   I applaud Rabbi Steven Weil for his many contributions to the Jewish community of the State of Michigan. He is a man dedicated to his faith, his family and his community, and he will be dearly missed. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Rabbi Weil on the great success he had at Young Israel, and wish him continued success as he moves on to Los Angeles, California.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to provide a $1,000 per child tax credit for America's working families. 
   Mr. President, this legislation builds on the $500 per child tax credit passed in 1997. The passage of the $500 per child tax credit was the culmination of an effort that began in 1994 with a proposal contained in the ``Contract with America.'' A child tax credit provision also was part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 which 104th Congress passed, but President Clinton vetoed. 
   Even with the $500 per child tax credit in place, today's total tax burden on families is still far too high. During this era of budget surpluses, we must remember that these surplus funds are tax overpayments that should be returned to the people who overpaid them, and not spent on wasteful government programs. American families will spend the money better. 
   The child tax credit will help hard working families who pay federal income tax and have children to support. Under this proposal, a working family with two children will receive $2,000 in the form of a tax credit to help pay their children's health, education and food expenses. Being a parent is not always easy. It becomes even more difficult if a family has trouble paying for necessities such as food, clothes, education, and health care for their children. This tax credit will help those families. 
   Mr. President, increasing the child tax credit to $1,000 is a statement by our government and our society that all our families and all of our children will not be left behind. Increasing the $500 per child tax credit to $1,000 would provide parents more than 38 million children, including roughly 1.5 million of my constituents in Michigan. 
   With that in mind, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting American families by supporting this legislation.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr. George Lee ``Sparky'' Anderson, who will be inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame Museum in Cooperstown, New York on July 23, 2000. Mr. Anderson spent 26 seasons as a manager in the Major Leagues, 17 of these with the Detroit Tigers. During this time, he was recognized not only as one of the best managers in the game of baseball, but also as one of the best ambassadors for the game of baseball. 
   Mr. Anderson was born on February 22, 1934, in Bridgewater, South Dakota. Upon graduation from high school, he signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers. He spent six years in the minor leagues before being called up to the major leagues by the Philadelphia Phillies in 1959. He was the regular second baseman for the Phillies that year, and was recognized as an intelligent, hustling player. He had a batting average of .218, 0 home runs and 34 runs batted in. He earned the nickname ``manos de oro'' from his teammates: ``the man with the golden hands.'' 
   As it turned out, 1959 was the only year Mr. Anderson spent in the major leagues as a player. He never left the game of baseball, though, and in 1964 he became the manager of a minor league team in Toronto. In 1969, he accepted a coaching position with the San Diego Padres, and prior to the 1970 season the Cincinnati Reds named him as their manager. 
   It quickly became apparent that managing suited Mr. Anderson well. Not only did it provide him with the opportunity to utilize his immense knowledge of the game of baseball, it also highlighted his ability to relate to and motivate players. Hall of Famer Joe Morgan, a member of the Reds during Mr. Anderson's years there and now a wonderful and respected baseball commentator, once said, ``Sparky had a way of making everybody look in the mirror at themselves. As far as I'm concerned, that's the key to being a good manager.'' 
   Under Mr. Anderson's guidance, the Reds became the dominant team of the 1970's. The team became known as The Big Red Machine for its ability to produce runs, led by such great offensive players as Morgan, Pete Rose, Johnny Bench, Tony Perez and Ken Griffey, Sr. Mr. Anderson earned the nickname ``Captain Hook'' for his innovative employment of relief pitchers, which was not the common practice of the time. This combination of offense and strategic wizardry proved to be lethal for opponents. In his first year with the team, the Reds won 102 games and the National League Pennant. From 1972-76, the Reds averaged more than one hundred wins per season, won three more National League pennants, and won back-to-back World Series Championships in 1975 and 1976. 
   After nine years in Cincinnati, Mr. Anderson came to the Detroit Tigers in 1979. The Tigers were struggling at the time, but possessed a core of young, talented players, including Jack Morris, Lou Whitaker, Alan Trammell and  Lance Parrish. Mr. Anderson molded this group of unique personalities into a team of champions. In 1984, just five years after his arrival, the team started 35-5--still the best 40-game start in the history of Major League Baseball--and never stopped their winning ways, ultimately bringing the Detroit Tigers their first World Series Championship since 1968. Very few people in the City of Detroit have forgotten Kirk Gibson's home run off the San Diego Padres' Goose Gossage in the eighth inning of Game 5, the hit which sewed up the series for the Tigers. 
   Mr. Anderson retired from managing the Tigers in 1995, having led the team to one more pennant win in 1987. Ultimately, in his 26 seasons as a Major League manager, nine with the Reds and 17 with the Tigers, his teams won 2,194 games, placing him third all-time, behind just Connie Mack and John McGraw. He was named Manager of the Year three times, twice in the National League and once in the American League. He is the only manager in the history of the game to win a World Series in both the American and National Leagues; he is the only manager to win 100 games in one season in both leagues; and he is the only manager to have over six hundred career victories in each league. His 34-21 mark in the postseason remains the best winning percentage for a manager in Major League history. 
   During his seventeen years in Detroit, Mr. Anderson became an important member of the community, and not because his position as Manager of the Detroit Tigers. His involvement with many charitable organizations led him to found his own in 1987. The organization is called CATCH, Caring Athletes Team for Children's & Henry Ford Hospitals, but is better known as ``Sparky Anderson's Charity for Children.'' The mission of CATCH is to improve the quality of life of pediatric patients at Children's & Henry Ford Hospitals in the State of Michigan. Since its inception, CATCH has issued grants to Children's Hospital of Michigan and Henry Ford Hospital of Detroit for approximately $1.4 million. In addition, the charitable organization has built an endowment of $4.5 million. When he founded CATCH, Mr. Anderson said ``there is nothing in this world that you will ever do that's better than helping a child.'' The growth of this endowment will allow ``Sparky Anderson's Charity for Children'' to continue helping children long into the future. 
   I thank Mr. Anderson for all that he has done for the City of Detroit and the State of Michigan. He spent his life in baseball quite simply because he loved the game, and he has never stopped believing that he is indebted to the game for the doors it opened for him, and the life it afforded him. Perhaps his greatest accomplishment, then, is having successfully given back to the game of baseball more than it gave to him, because he certainly has done this. He stands out as one of the best ambassadors for baseball in the history of the game, a sports figure who managed to give as much to his community as he did to his team. I know that he is loved and revered in the State of Michigan not only because of the World Series championship he helped bring to the City of Detroit in 1984, but also because of the manner in which he handled himself over the course of his seventeen years there. He became an important part of the Detroit community--his place there transcended wins and losses. 
   I am sure that Mr. Anderson will enjoy this special occasion with his wife, Carol, who has been with him through the entire journey, and their family. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Mr. Sparky Anderson on his induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame this weekend. Though he will enter the Hall wearing a Cincinnati Reds uniform, I know that the Detroit Tigers, the City of Detroit and the State of Michigan will always hold a special place in his heart, just as Sparky continues to hold a special place in the hearts of millions of Michiganians.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in expressing our condolences to PAUL COVERDELL's wife Nancy and all the members of his family. 
   I think that anybody who has watched the expressions and condolences that have already been offered would recognize immediately the extent to which Senator COVERDELL touched all of us in the Senate and the extent to which he was a beloved colleague and friend. 
   PAUL's life achievement, in so many different ways, obviously deserves the tributes we are paying today. I wish to comment on some of those achievements. First, PAUL COVERDELL was one of the really remarkable leaders of our time. He began his political career in the Georgia Legislature and rose up to the leadership position in the Republican Party in the Georgia State Senate. He then came to Washington and made his mark as the Director of the Peace Corps. He was very instrumental in expanding and successfully helping the Peace Corps to transition into a new era. 
   PAUL was a leader in his party. He served as chairman of the Georgia Republican Party at a time when there weren't a lot of Republicans in Georgia. But thanks to him, the party grew in strength. That is when I actually first became acquainted with him, because I chaired the Republican Party in Michigan at that time and we met in the context of national party meetings. Then, of course, PAUL was elected to this body in 1992. I think everybody here is aware of how effective and how competent and able he was. He moved into the leadership of this Chamber fairly quickly--in, I think, his first term in the Senate. That doesn't happen too often in a place where seniority counts so much. But his observable abilities, talents, and incredible work ethic brought him to the attention of all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. On our side of the aisle, it resulted in him being put in a leadership role early in his career. 
   More than being an effective leader, PAUL was a tremendous colleague when it came time to needing some assistance on a project. I can't think of one important piece of legislation that I have worked on in the time I have been in the Senate when PAUL COVERDELL wasn't helping me in some fashion to get it through. I remember coming here in my very first couple of legislative efforts, on amendments and bills, as a freshman Member who did not know how this place worked and looking to him, who was a slightly more senior Member, for guidance and help; he was always there. He has been there for all of us. That is why I think today is such a tough day. It would not really matter what the issue was, he was somebody who would try to help you. His staff was built by him to be of similar assistance. 
   Of course, for all of us, probably the principal thing we would acknowledge in terms of PAUL's attributes was the tremendous friendship he offered to all of us who were his friends. I had a unique relationship with him in the sense that he served as a mentor and friend to me in my first couple of years. When he sought a leadership position, I was proud of the fact that he asked me to place his name in nomination for that. I did so on the second occasion he sought to be in the leadership of our party. When you are asked to nominate somebody for one of these  jobs, it obviously means a lot to you and tells you that you are well 
   regarded by that person. I have to say it means an unbelievable amount to me to think that Senator PAUL COVERDELL thought of me as someone who he would want to play that role in his political career. 
   As I said earlier, the reaction of his colleagues today demonstrates that others share my high opinion of PAUL. So many have given statements already, and I know more will follow that will move us all. We have seen people express themselves in ways we never thought we would see. People who are known to come to the Senate floor and wage verbal debates back and forth on serious topics have already come here today and demonstrated, in the most human way, that they were so close to and touched by PAUL COVERDELL, and that all of the partisanship and the political debate is really second to them in importance to describing the friendship he provided all of us. 
   So as I close we pray for the best for PAUL's wife and family. We give thanks for having been able to share his friendship. On a personal level, I say: Goodbye, PAUL, we will never forget you. You were a key part of all we have done here, and you will continue to play a role as our memories of you continue. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, this amendment, which I described briefly yesterday, embodies the principles of our legislation, S. 2808, which has been introduced by the Senators I mentioned and myself, to temporarily suspend the Federal gasoline tax for 150 days, while holding harmless the highway trust fund and protecting the Social Security trust fund. 
   America is facing a crisis, and we have to take action now. Yesterday I spoke before the Senate about how, during my travels over the Fourth of July recess, I was struck that people in my State had one thing on their minds, and that was the price of gasoline. It was the most important issue on virtually everybody's mind. It was the second most important issue, and it was the third most important issue. 
   As I talked with the citizens in my State, I asked them to join me in making sure this issue to suspend the Federal gasoline tax received more attention in the Congress. I am proud of how they have already responded. 
   Over the last 10 days, we have had a web site through which people could sign a petition online urging Congress to suspend the gas tax. Literally over 100,000 people have logged on to the site and thousands have already joined this petition drive. 
   On behalf of these thousands of Michigan citizens--and I know there are millions more across the country who are feeling the pinch at the pump--I am here today to fight for relief on behalf of our consumers, our minivan parents, our farmers, and others for a bill that would suspend the Federal gasoline tax for 150 days. 
   Yesterday I told this body how citizens throughout Michigan were demanding quick relief from these high gas prices. People 
   from all walks of life have talked with me about this: 
   Farmers who, according to our Farm Bureau, are likely to see their net family farm income decrease by 35 percent; 
   A minivan mom with seven kids who now has to give up her minivan because it costs her $70 to fill up the tank; 
   Every day men and women who banged on gas cans during a parade in Traverse City, MI, demanding immediate relief from high gas prices;

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the cosponsors of this amendment and I are not alone in our support for the suspension of the gas tax. A number of taxpayer groups also believe suspending the tax is good policy, and have endorsed such a suspension. Among these groups are the National Federation of Independent Business, the National Taxpayers Union, Americans for Tax Reform, and Citizens Against Government Waste. 
   Let me read from the NFIB letter that states:  
   For a small company that consumes 50,000 gallons of diesel fuel in a month, the increase in prices in the past year will cost that company an additional $40,000 per month.  
   By suspending the gas tax for 150 days, we could save that small business over $60,000! I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD the letters of support from each of these organizations to highlight the board based support for this suspension.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate the debate we have had today. The bottom line remains the same: People in America are paying too much  for gasoline. Congress must do something about it. I have heard an array of objections raised by people as to why this can't be done. 
   Given the actions this Congress regularly takes on appropriations legislation, on budget legislation, on tax legislation, moving gigantic packages in short periods of time when we do our omnibus spending bills, the notion that this legislation somehow doesn't accomplish the mission of protecting the highway fund from diminution is, to me, an inaccurate statement. 
   The road projects will continue. The legislation ensures that the money will be there. We are aware that we have on-budget surpluses, not touching Social Security, adequate to meet the cost of suspending the gas tax. I believe those claims just simply are off the mark. 
   This will be a stake through the heart, if this is defeated, of the consumers of America who are paying way too much right now in gasoline prices. They deserve a break. Consumers in my State, for whom I come to the Senate floor and fight every day, deserve that break. 
   We are paying the highest gas prices in America. Whether consumers drive a minivan back and forth to children's activities, or drive a car to their job, regardless of their needs, in Michigan and across America, I find it hard to believe there is anyplace in America today where Members of this body are not hearing from constituents that the price of gasoline is too high. 
   We selected 5 months as the duration of this action for a simple reason. That is what we have been told by the spokesperson at the Department of Energy and in this administration is the approximate duration of time it will take for the various efforts they are engaged in to try to bring down the price of gasoline. 
   I am happy to modify this amendment to a shorter timeframe if we have assurances from anybody that would, in fact, be an adequate period of time for the supply issues to be addressed. That is not what we have heard. We heard it will take longer. We cannot wait longer in Michigan. We want relief now. The one thing we can do as a body is to suspend the Federal gas tax for 150 days. 
   I believe this is a clear-cut choice. We are here to try to help the men and women, the hard-working families of this country. This is something we can do in a concrete way to help them. It can be done in a fashion that does not undermine the road projects going on. 
   I believe this price, as a result of the suspension of the gas tax, will translate into prices at the pump. We saw it in our State the other day. As soon as the station brought down prices 18 cents, everybody went to that station for gas. 
   In any station, any oil company that does not bring down its prices in accordance with the passage of this legislation will lose business to the stations that do. That is the way of supply and demand. That is the way price will work. It will create the competitive market in which the people who abide by the terms of this legislation quickly benefit because they will be the ones with the customers. 
   It will help the farmers in my State who are right now screaming because of high gasoline prices. It will help the tourism industry in my State which is deeply concerned that the price of gasoline is so high. It will help the automotive industry which is worried that we will once again see a recession caused by a shift from American-made products to foreign imports. 
   For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I assure them, look at it yourself; you will see the language is explicit. The highway trust fund moneys will not be diminished if we do this but consumers will gain the benefit with which we sought to protect them in the suspension of this gas tax. 
   Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President. I rise to support the American Community Renewal and New Markets Empowerment Amendment offered by Senators SANTORUM, LIEBERMAN, KERREY, myself and others. 
   This amendment represents a bipartisan effort designed to address the social and economic ills which are preventing our poorest areas from participating in the current economic boom. I strongly believe that it will go a long way toward bringing the economic growth and sense of community necessary to maintain, safe streets, strong families, and thriving neighborhoods. 
   Under this legislation, 50 new Renewal Communities--one for each state--would be created. Characterized by pervasive poverty, Renewal Communities provide financial incentives to promote economic growth and social health in distressed areas. 
   Incentives include: a zero capital gains rate, increased expensing of equipment costs for small businesses, employment wage credit for hiring Renewal Community Residents and an extension of the Brownfields provision. 
   In addition, our amendment would increase housing opportunities nationwide for poorer families by increasing and indexing for inflation the Low Income Housing Tax Credit and the volume caps on Private Activity Bonds. 
   Since implemented in 1986, thanks to the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, in Michigan, 27,000 housing units have gone up. Nationally, the credit is responsible for one million apartments dedicated to low-income tenants at restricted rents. 
   Mr. President, increasing the volume cap on private activity bonds will help finance thousands of single and multi-family mortgages and property improvement loans. 
   The legislation also calls for the establishment of Individual Development Accounts to help the working poor build financial assets. 
   The IDAs in this bill apply this concept nationally, giving all families the opportunity to buy a home, further their education or start up a new business. 
   The amendment also includes the faith-based treatment and charitable choice provisions will continue the work started in the 1996 Welfare Reform bill. 
   Religious-based organizations will be able to compete on equal grounds with non-religious organizations. This will allow them to provide drug and alcohol treatment and other welfare-related services without compromising the religious nature of their treatment or organization. 
   The creation of privately managed, for-profit companies and the New Markets tax credit will provide the financial security necessary to bring investment to communities which would otherwise be considered too high-risk. 
   Finally, Mr. President, this amendment includes the New Millennium Classrooms Act, which would help address the issue of the digital divide, providing tax incentives to companies to increase the amount of computer and related technology donations to qualified recipients in designated poor areas. 
   To increase the amount of technology donated to schools, libraries, senior centers and vocational education centers in economically disadvantaged areas, the New Millennium Classrooms Act would expand the parameters of the current tax deduction and add a tax credit. 
   Introduced as the New Millennium Classrooms Act in March, 1999, this legislation has the support of 32 cosponsors and most recently passed as an amendment to the Affordable Education Act, on a vote of 96-2. 
   Despite the recent gains made in increasing the level of computers and technology in schools, unacceptable disparities still exist. 
   Schools with greater numbers of poor and minority students simply do not have the same access to the Internet and computer technology as wealthier schools and schools with lower minority enrollment. 
   If our poorer communities are to truly experience a complete and long-term economic rejuvenation, their residents must have access and instruction in information technologies. 
   Many Americans--particularly those with less income and education--are still missing out on the digital age. More and more, everyday activities migrate to the Internet. Unless we act now, the gap in opportunities available to those on the other side of the digital divide will continue to increase. 
   I hope that my colleagues will support this amendment to provide real hope and opportunity for all Americans.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment. I am a cosponsor of the legislation that it embodies. I believe this is the kind of direction we should pursue to try to revitalize parts of this country which require assistance to be completed on parts of our overall economic progress and growth as a Nation. 
   I am particularly pleased that included in this is our new millenniums classroom component which will make it far easier for schools in this country to gain access to the computer technology they need to make sure that the digital divide, as we call it, is closed, so that opportunities for people to gain the training and skills they need with respect to our new high-tech world will be available to them. 
   I compliment the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Connecticut for their work on this and look forward to working with them to secure its ultimate passage and enactment.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to talk with respect to one of the amendments on that list of 113, one that I had planned to offer, which would basically be an amendment that embodies a bill I introduced, S. 2808, the purpose of which was to temporarily suspend the Federal gasoline tax for 150 days, while holding harmless the highway trust fund and protecting the Social Security trust fund. 
   Obviously, this is not the type of legislation that would normally be brought on an appropriations bill. I have traveled throughout the State of Michigan in recent weeks where we are confronting gasoline prices that are so high that the motorists in our State and people in industries that depend on the purchase of gasoline and other fuels are up in arms at a level I don't believe I can ever remember. 
   Whether you are in the Abraham family, which owns a minivan and pays $50 to fill up the tank, or whether you are a family that has multiple minivans and fills up more than one tank a week, or whether you are a farmer who has many needs in the production of agricultural commodities for the use of motor vehicles and other machines that require oil and fuel, or whether you are in the automotive industry that depends on the purchase of SUVs, light trucks, and other American-made automobiles and motor vehicles, or whether it is the tourism industry that requires reasonably priced gasoline in order to make sure that summer vacation plans are carried out--and tourism is an economic sector that remains strong--regardless of your role in my State, you are very upset because today the price of gasoline in Michigan is almost 75 to 80 cents higher than it was a year ago. In  fact, this Monday, a national survey of gasoline prices indicated that in the city of Detroit, in the metropolitan area, we have the highest gasoline prices in America. 
   Something needs to be done about this. We have heard Senator MURKOWSKI and others on the Energy Committee talk about a variety of long-term strategies, ranging from the development of domestic energy, to addressing alternative energy sources, to conservation. We have talked a little bit here about regulations that have increased the cost of fuel development. We have talked about it in the Senate and have heard about issues that range from whether or not the oil companies are in some sort of collusive effort and are gouging the consumers of America. 
   We have heard all of these things. But the bottom line is, taking action in any of those areas will not dramatically change the price of gasoline in the short run. We may, if we develop more domestic energy sources, be in a better position to control production and supply and, as a consequence, price. We may, if we address certain regulations, make it possible to change the price. But none of that is going to happen overnight. 
   In my State and across the Midwest, and really across the entire country, people want action sooner, not later. There is only one thing we can do as a Congress that will bring action sooner rather than later with respect to the price of gasoline, and that is to temporarily suspend the Federal tax on gasoline of 18.4 cents. Overnight, at every filling station in America and every gas station, the price of gasoline would theoretically come down by about 18 cents. Believe me, people will show up to buy that less expensive gasoline. 
   In Michigan, just a few days ago, a gas station, having heard my plea to suspend the Federal gas tax, reduced the price of gasoline for 2 hours at that station in the Detroit metropolitan area by 18.4 cents. There were lines of traffic a quarter mile virtually in every direction to get into that station because people who had been desperate to pay less for gasoline had the chance to do so--for 2 hours at least. 
   Our State's economy and the Nation's economy is being affected by these high fuel costs. Recently, I conducted a hearing in Warren, MI. We heard from people in the Michigan agricultural community who indicated to us that, according to their estimates--and, in fact, we heard from a family farmer himself who said they expect their net family farm income this year to be approximately 35 percent lower than it was projected to be. But we heard from people in the Michigan automotive community who indicated that already they were beginning to see indications of a shift from the purchase of new vehicles made in America to the purchase of imported vehicles. 
   I think many of us remember back when we had energy problems in the 1970s and we saw a shift away from American-manufactured vehicles to foreign imports, and what that did not just to the economy of Michigan or the auto industry but its rippling effect across the entire economy of this country. 
   We heard from others as well. We heard from consumers who came to that hearing and talked about the impact on their families and the sort of things they could no longer afford to do. 
   It is not only people who came to the hearing that I heard from. Last weekend, I was up in Traverse City, MI, to participate in the annual cherry festival. I was confronted by a group calling themselves the ``Traverse City Gas Can Gang.'' When I was walking in the parade, they were imploring me, and virtually all other political figures present at that parade, to do something about the gasoline tax because basically they couldn't afford the price of gasoline. 
   I had a press conference in the city of Alpena, MI, and a lady senior citizen attending the press conference told me she had to walk to the press conference. She was interested in what I had to say about gas prices. She walked because she couldn't afford to pay for gas in order to drive. She was not a young constituent. She was an elderly senior citizen. 
   But I am not the only one confronting these kinds of constituents. These high prices across America are substantially more than they were a year ago. The metro Detroit area currently suffers under the highest gas prices in the country. Even though the price has come down from approximately $2 a gallon, it is still approximately $1.85 a gallon this week. These prices are 40 cents a gallon higher than they were in May of this year. That is a 27-percent increase in 2 months. 
   Of course, it is not in Michigan alone. Across the country people are confronting the same kind of significant increases. In June of 1999 gas prices in my State averaged just over $1.13 a gallon in Detroit, $1.17 a gallon throughout Michigan. One year later, gas prices were averaging $2.14 a gallon in Detroit, and just under $2.08 a gallon in the State of Michigan as a whole. That is almost a 90-percent rate of inflation for gas in the State. 
   As I pointed out, former Soviet Republics don't suffer inflation this aggravated. Even with the recent slight drop in gas prices, it is still 56 percent higher this year than it was 1 year ago. 
   There are a lot of possible explanations. There are a lot of factors that have come into play. This Congress and this Senate have a responsibility to deal with the long-term issues. But we also have a responsibility to provide relief in the short term, if we can. That is what can be accomplished if we were to temporarily suspend the Federal gas taxes. Eighteen cents a gallon would make a big difference to the people in my State. 
   This is not insignificant. It is more than a 10-percent reduction in the price of regular gasoline. For the typical one-car or one-minivan family, that would mean savings of $150 over the next 5 months. For those who are in the trucking industry, of course it would reduce their diesel prices by almost 25 cents a gallon. That would make a huge difference for them in terms of their bottom line as well. 
   My proposal is designed to simultaneously reduce the price at the pump and protect the road-funding dollars that many of our States, including certainly mine, are counting on from Washington. We would replenish any lost revenue to the highway trust fund at the same time we would suspend the gas tax. 
   As you know, we are confronting for this year as well as for the next year record high surpluses of non-Social Security dollars. Our proposed amendment would, in fact, use those 
   non-Social Security surplus dollars to make sure that highway funding remains constant. 
   It is our projection and estimation that over the next 5 months the suspension of the gas tax would reduce the highway trust fund by approximately $6.5 billion. Our amendment would replenish those dollars from the general fund. 
   Indeed, the language of our amendment states specifically that nothing in this subsection may be construed as authorizing a reduction in the apportionments of the highway trust fund to the States as a result of the temporary reduction in rates of tax. 
   In short, the proposal embodied in my legislation and in the amendment I had planned to bring to the Interior bill would suspend the gas tax and make sure the highway funds continue to flow by using non-Social Security surplus dollars. 
   When we initially sought to bring this amendment on the Interior appropriations bill, it was unclear what the Senate schedule would be with respect to other appropriate legislation where we might bring this amendment. I am happy to hear this morning that a unanimous consent agreement was entered into which will allow us to take up tomorrow the estate tax--the death tax--legislation that has been discussed over the last day and a half, and that amendments such as this one would be in order at that time. 
   Indeed, I have already been in consultation with our leadership as to securing one of those amendment slots to bring this amendment in the context of the tax bill, which is clearly a more preferable vehicle for us to address these issues. It is my plan to return to the floor tomorrow when that tax bill is before us with one of the amendments to be offered on the Republican side. 
   Before I leave, I wish to make it very clear to my colleagues that this is a serious problem--not only in Michigan but across the country. If we continue to have to pay gas prices of the level we are paying today, even though they  have come down slightly in the last couple of weeks, it is going to have a very serious impact on the economy of this country. It is going to hurt our agricultural sector, our tourism sector, our automotive sector, and it will have a rippling effect across America. That means it is not only a problem for somebody who owns a minivan or for somebody who drives a truck; it is going to ultimately be a problem for all of us. 
   I believe over time a lot of this will be alleviated as supply and production increases by Saudi Arabia and others begin to take effect. But I can't wait that long. My constituents can't wait that long. We need to do something sooner, not later. 
   I believe the one thing that makes sense to do, that we can afford to do, that will make a difference immediately, and that will provide the consumers in my State with an opportunity to be able to afford gasoline--or at least more easily afford gasoline--is for us to recognize that we are going to have a huge surplus this year, a projected surplus next year, and that a little bit of that surplus over the next 5 months can be used to protect the highway trust fund and give consumers a break. I believe in doing that. 
   We will do something that will be immensely supported by the people across America who have to fill up their tanks once or twice a week by average working families in this country for whom a rise of 63 percent or 90 percent in the price makes a big 
   difference. I believe it is an action that we should take. The last time we voted on it, there were approximately 43 votes in favor of a gas tax suspension. But that was before these prices crested to the level of today. I believe the Senate should have one more vote on this. I look forward to this debate tomorrow. 
   At this time, I will withdraw from the list my amendment and allow the Senator from Washington to continue with other amendments on this bill. I thank him for his indulgence. I look forward to debating this issue tomorrow. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, during the debate on the Labor-Health & Human Services-Education appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2001, Senator DASCHLE offered an amendment relating to genetic testing and the potential for genetics-based discrimination in the workplace. 
   I was thrilled at the recent announcement of the completion of the human genetic map, and with it, the possibility of the full identification of the more than three billion nucleotide bases that comprise the genome. This knowledge will bring with it limitless possibilities, vastly improving our quality of life and health. 
   Yet with this knowledge comes great responsibility. For all the good this information can do for us, there is also the potential of great harm and misuse. One of the challenges that faces us even now, is to ensure that genetic information about an individual is not used against him or herself. 
   Despite my strong conviction that genetic information must never be used to discriminate against an individual, I was unable to support the amendment offered by Senator DASCHLE relating to genetic discrimination in the workplace. 
   Senator DASCHLE's amendment is, in reality, much more than simply a technical amendment to an appropriations bill. It is a 5-page, far-reaching, broadly written, piece of legislation, which would create an entirely new class of discrimination law, creating inequalities and conflicting with existing law. 
   This legislation would usurp the jurisdiction of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and allow genetic discrimination suits to go directly to the court system. This is highly unusual for discrimination suits and would afford this form of discrimination preferential treatment over any other form of discrimination. 
   In addition, this bill comes into direct conflict with the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA. The ADA already captures genetic discrimination--this has been affirmed by the Secretary of the EEOC and the Supreme Court. If we pass a separate bill that preempts the protections already provided for in the ADA, we could potentially be undermining our support for the people covered by those protections. Just to highlight the possible inequalities--the Daschle amendment  would give a genetic marker greater protection than a paraplegic. 
   Given the drastic and over-reaching changes which would be brought about by the Daschle amendment, especially in a new area such as genetic testing, consideration of this legislation must be deliberate and well-informed. 
   Yet, there has not been a single hearing on this legislation. In fact, the amendment language was not available for review until only an hour or so before the vote. I believe it would be wrong and even negligent to pass legislation without knowing exactly how it would affect Americans' lives, now and far into the future. 
   The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee has already planned the first hearing on this matter in July. I am confident, that with careful deliberation and thorough debate, we will succeed in finding the most effective and appropriate way to ensure that no one will have their genetic-information used against them. I am looking forward to the challenge.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will be brief because in many ways I am very pleased with the direction of today's debate, particularly with the fact that it actually will result in some votes. We have been on the floor talking about trying to lock up Social Security on many occasions. I was seeking to get a final vote on a lockbox that I think really does do the job of protecting Social Security. I think we did it four times and couldn't get to a final vote. 
   Today, we are moving in the direction of getting final votes on both a  form of Social Security lockbox and on the issue of locking up Medicare. I think that is an important step. 
   While I am happy to support almost any effort that makes it more difficult to spend the Social Security surplus, I do not believe that the forms offered today go as far as we should to ensure a permanent off-limits nature of the Social Security surplus. I hope the spirit which we have seen today, of working towards giving people options to vote, is one that we can build on, and that I will soon have an opportunity to have a vote on the Social Security lockbox proposal on which Senator DOMENICI, Senator ASHCROFT, and I have been working. 
   I think it is a very productive debate to talk about treating the Medicare surplus, the Part A of the Medicare trust fund, in the same fashion. The disagreements over details are ones that ought to be something we can work out. 
   I do not think implications of intent with respect to the future spending of these dollars that are being made are on point with the intent of the draft Senator ASHCROFT has offered. I think his goal is very clearly to try to protect the surplus in Social Security from being spent, period. I think that is his motive. I will leave it to him to comment. 
   I think implications that there were any ulterior goals in his proposal are off the mark. In fact, I hope people will examine more closely his longstanding position on this issue. While it may be now, in the middle of a Presidential campaign, that people are talking about a Medicare lockbox, I remember Senator ASHCROFT talking about a Medicare lockbox more than a year before the Presidential election and certainly months before it was an issue in terms of the national Presidential debate. As a colleague, I appreciate the fact that he was ahead of everybody else in trying to raise that issue on the Senate side. We have worked together to try to move both of these issues today and in the past. 
   I want to go on record in favor of having mechanisms in place that protect these trust funds from seeing these dollars used for anything other than their purpose. One hopes that would be the outcome. If not in the context of this legislation, then let us be honest about it: The likelihood that this type of amendment is going to be able to survive the entire conference process may be questionable. I hope by going on record--as I suspect by the end of this afternoon every Member of the Senate will--in favor of locking up both of these surpluses, we will take a step in the direction of ultimately achieving it. I certainly intend to come back to the Senate and, in the context of legislation that can get to final passage inclusive of such lockboxes, give the Senate opportunities to support such an effort. 
   As I talk to constituents in my State, and from comments made by people all over America, there is little doubt that one of the most frustrating things to people, whether they are already Social Security recipients or will be in the future, is the fact that they have watched as too many Social Security surplus dollars have been spent on other things in order to make the deficit appear smaller. I think they are going to be very pleased this year when we end the fiscal year not only with a balanced budget but also without spending one penny of Social Security on anything but Social Security or the reduction of debt. That is a sea change. 
   I don't think we should lose sight of the circumstances in which it has come about. Senator ASHCROFT, myself, Senator DOMENICI, and others in the budget process have worked to make sure there were in place the kinds of budget rules that precluded Social Security surpluses from being spent on other things. This year taxpayers who have been so disappointed in the past that such moneys were used for other purposes are going to receive the good news that they were not and that they are not going to be in the future. Indeed, this year's budget resolution, as last year's, incorporates the kinds of rules that will protect it. I am proud to have been involved in the drafting of those rules. 
   I am glad we are back on this topic. It may not resolve it fully, in the context of the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, but hopefully, after today, we have at least set the precedent that we will create these lockboxes, that we are not going to prevent votes from being taken on final passage of the various options that are out there, at least to get final votes on those options in some context. 
   I look forward to bringing back an even stronger Social Security lockbox and for a chance to get a vote on the version we have drafted. I would like to have that opportunity. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. I spoke on the floor a few minutes ago and raised many of the same inquiries the Senator has raised. I am disappointed, after so many efforts on our part to get a vote, that we couldn't. 
   On the other hand, I indicated I was heartened that today at least there seems to be a willingness to begin to give people 
   votes on issues relating to the lockbox. I want to have the votes. 
   There is a clear distinction between the lockbox we have authored together and we want to have an opportunity for that stronger lockbox to be considered. I want it done soon. It ought to be done on a vehicle that becomes a law.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to comment, in response to the comments of the Senator from North Dakota, the following: The Senator from North Dakota has characterized the stance of those of us who have not supported his proposal for a Medicare and Social Security lockbox as resisting his efforts for 2 years. Resisting his efforts is not, in my judgment, a proper characterization. We have not supported those efforts. But what we have done today is provided the Senator from North Dakota a chance to have a vote on a proposal he has worked on and for which he has sought support. I would like to distinguish that from what I consider to be the accurate definition of resistance, which is to not even give a vote to people who have a legitimate proposal to bring to the floor of the Senate, and I consider the amendment Senators DOMENICI and ASHCROFT and I drafted with respect to a Social Security lockbox to be a legitimate piece of legislation that deserves the same consideration that we will soon give the Senator from North Dakota. 
   I say to the Senator from North Dakota and his colleagues, I hope, in the spirit with which a vote is being offered on the proposal that he has today, we will get a straight up-or-down vote on the proposal we have been offering because now that you have had this chance we will see what happens, obviously, both here and in the conference that will follow the passage of this legislation. I would like to have the opportunity to get a straight up-or-down vote on the legislation that on five or six or whatever number it is separate occasions has been prevented from happening. That to me would be the difference between resistance and lack of support. 
   I do not ask the Senator from North Dakota to vote for my proposal. I hope he and his colleagues would at least give us an opportunity to let all of us cast our votes up or down on it. I hope we get that chance. I yield the floor.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri. I cannot resist responding to the closing remarks by the Senator from North Dakota. I have to say, I interpret his comments as saying he and his colleagues, because they oppose or would vote against the lockbox proposal we have offered so many times, would not even let us have an up-or-down vote on it. I think that is unfortunate. 
   I think the way the Senate works, they certainly have an ability to prevent votes. But so do we. I hope we will not have to get to the point where we have to engage both sides in those kinds of tactics. We have certainly demonstrated today a willingness to have a vote on his Social Security lockbox proposal. The concerns he raised in the letter that was written by Secretary Rubin, the long-since departed Secretary of the Treasury, were in fact responded to by us in the modifications that we brought in the most recent version of this lockbox. 
   Certainly I am not going to get into the merits of that at this point, but the notion that because the Secretary of the Treasury argues that something could cause problems should prevent us from having a chance to vote on an issue--there are plenty of issues we vote here where Cabinet members have raised the specter of problems if such votes or legislation were passed. 
   It is pretty clear to me that notwithstanding the seemingly positive steps taken today to give the Senator from North Dakota an opportunity to have his Social Security lockbox voted on, we are still going to meet impediments in the effort to get ours voted on. I would put the Presiding Officer and the Senate on notice, we are going to keep trying. We, unfortunately, may have to go into the sorts of tactical approaches that cause a lot of time to be taken when it seems to me we could accommodate both sides on this fairly easily. In any event, we will keep pressing forward on it. 
   I close by complimenting the Senator from Missouri whose steadfast efforts on both the Social Security lockbox as well as the Medicare lockbox front predated the efforts of anyone else of whom I am aware, certainly on the Medicaid issue. He has certainly demonstrated his commitment to that. Certainly his efforts to bring these issues to the floor deserve all our praise and thanks.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in honor and in memory of a dear friend of mine, Mr. Arthur Saltzman, of Franklin, Michigan, who passed away on June 18, 2000, at the age of 79. Mr. Saltzman was not only a friend, but an inspiration--a man who dedicated much of his life to improving the State of Michigan. 
   Born in New York City in 1920, Mr. Saltzman came to Michigan to work for Ford Motor Company, where he was in charge of training/management programs for salaried employees. 
   After Mr. Saltzman retired from Ford, he worked for the Greater Detroit Chamber of Commerce, was a consultant with the U.S. Department of Energy in Washington, DC, and was Director of the Michigan State University Advanced Management Program in Troy, Michigan. He also was Director of the Michigan Economic Opportunity Office and a member of the Oakland University Charter Board of Trustees. 
   Mr. Saltzman earned his Bachelor's, Master's and Doctoral degrees from New York University. During World War II, he was with the Army Specialized Training Program, serving in both the Philippines and Tokyo. 
   Surviving Mr. Saltzman are his wife, Florence, with whom he celebrated his 50th Anniversary on January 30, 1999; daughters Amie R. Saltzman and Sarah Saltzman; his sister, Doris Chartow of Syracuse, New York; grandchildren, Joshua and Joanna; five nephews and four nieces. 
   Mr. President, Arthur Saltzman was a leader in the Michigan Republican Party at both the State and County level. I had the privilege to work with him on many occasions, and I found it to be a wonderful experience each and every time. Arthur was a man who truly enjoyed life, and his love for living was infectious. I am sure that he will be deeply missed by everyone who knew him.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in honor and in memory of a dear friend of mine, Mrs. Jacquelyn Stewart, who passed away on June 19 at the age of 59. Mrs. Stewart was not only a friend, but a truly special woman. She believed deeply in the ideals of the Republican Party, and worked extremely hard to fight for these ideals. 
   Mrs. Stewart was born in Detroit, Michigan. After attending Henry Ford Community College in Dearborn, Michigan, she attended the Oakland County Police Academy. She spent 15 years as an investigator with the Oakland County Prosecutor's Office. 
   On May 8, 1989, Mrs. Stewart was appointed to the Michigan Liquor Control Commission as an Administrative Commissioner. In 1997, Governor John Engler elevated her to position of Chairwoman of the Commission. For her work in that position, Mrs. Stewart is credited with restoring credibility to an agency that had fallen under controversy. 
   Mrs. Stewart also served the Oakland County Republican Party in many ways, most prominently as one of the top aides to former prosecutor and current County Executive, L. Brooks Patterson. In the mid-1980's, she led a petition drive that fell just short of placing a proposed restoration of the death penalty on the Michigan ballot. 
   Mrs. Stewart is survived by her husband, Mr. James Stewart, former longtime Huntington Woods Police Chief, as well as her sons, Chris and Timothy Boelter; daughter Elizabeth Rose; stepson James Stewart, and two brothers. 
   Mr. President, I consider it a privilege to have been able to know and work with Jackie Stewart. She was a woman of complete integrity, who fought for what she believed regardless of the odds against her. Her energy and boundless efforts were an inspiration to men and women throughout the State of Michigan, and I am sure she will be dearly missed by everyone who knew her.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the Migratory Bird Conservation Act which I introduced with the Minority Leader, Senator DASCHLE, and our late colleague Senator Chafee, is designed to protect the habitat of the over 90 endangered species of migratory birds which spend the spring and summer months in the United States and the winter months in other Western Hemisphere nations. 
   This will be the third time this bill has passed the Senate. It previously cleared the Senate in 1998 and early 1999, but, until Monday's 384-22 House vote, the legislation was stalled in the other chamber. 
   Despite taking almost three years, this legislation remains very timely. Many bird species of birds are threatened despite the growing popularity of birdwatching. 
   Every year approximately 25 million Americans travel to observe birds, and 60 million American adults watch and feed birds at home. According to the Fish and Wildlife Service, bird watching and feeding generates fully $20 billion every year in revenue across America. 
   Protecting the various species of birds benefits the nation in a variety of ways. The increased popularity of birdwatching is increasingly reflected in the new tourist dollars being spent in small, rural communities. Healthy bird communities also prevent crop failures and infestations by controlling insect populations, thus saving hundreds of millions of dollars in economic losses each year to farming and timber interests. And yet, despite the enormous benefits we derive from our bird populations, many of them are struggling to survive. 
   In my own State we are working to bring the Kirtland's Warbler back from the brink of extinction. A few years ago, the population of this distinctive bird has been estimated at approximately 200 nesting pairs. Since then, a great deal of work has been done by  Michigan DNR employees to preserve the Kirtland's Warbler habitat in the Bahamas, where they winter. Thanks in large part to this effort, the number of breeding pairs has recently increased to an estimated 800. 
   The problem we face in Michigan is simple. Since the entire species spends half of the year in the Bahamas, the significant efforts made by Michigan's Department of 
   Natural Resources and concerned residents of Michigan will not be enough to save this bird if its winter habitat is destroyed. The same story is likely true for at least one bird species in every other state. 
   Because migratory birds range across a number of international borders every year, we must work to establish safeguards at both ends of their migration routes, as well as at critical stopover areas along their way. Only in this case can conservation efforts prove successful. 
   That is why Senator DASCHLE, Senator Chafee, and I introduced the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act. This legislation will protect bird habitats across international boundaries by teaming businesses with conservation groups, thus combining capital with know-how. 
   These entities will then partner with local organizations in countries where bird habitat is endangered to help teach the local people how to preserve and maintain their critical natural habitat. 
   The 5 year demonstration project created by this Act will provide $5 million each year to help establish cost-sharing, habitat conservation programs in the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean. 
   This legislation is proactive, avoids complicated and expensive bureaucratic structures and will bring needed focus and expertise to areas now receiving relatively little attention in the area of environmental degradation. And it has wide support in the environmental and conservation communities. 
   This legislation is endorsed by the National Audubon Society, Ducks Unlimited, the Nature Conservancy, the American Bird Conservancy, Defenders of Wildlife, the American Forest and Paper Association and the Conservation Fund. These organizations agree that establishing partnerships between business, government and nongovernmental organizations both here and abroad can greatly enhance the protection of migratory bird habitat. 
   I want to thank the distinguished minority leader, my original partner for the past two and one half years, for his hard work and efforts on behalf of this legislation. His involvement and perserverance--long with those of Peter Hanson and Eric Washburn of his staff--helped us overcome a variety of obstacles and pave the way for this bill to become law. 
   I also want to thank Senator BOB SMITH, Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, for his efforts to move this legislation forward. The continuing commitment of the Senate Environment Committee was essential to bringing this bill to the finish line. 
   And let me recognize the efforts of Kevin Kolevar of my staff, who began the work on this bill back in February of 1998. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I want to recognize the efforts of our former colleague and friend, Senator John Chafee, who passed away earlier this year. As chairman of the Environmental Committee, Senator Chafee was a driving force behind this legislation. Senator Chafee and his committee staffer, Jason Patlis, shepherded this bill through the Senate twice. 
   This legislation is yet another addition to the long list of contributions made by Senator John Chafee to protect our natural resources for generations. 
   I can think of no better tribute to Senator Chafee than to send this bill to the President with a resounding bipartisan vote by the Senate.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the American National Committee for Tyre and the International Association to Save Tyre for all the good work they are doing to raise awareness on the issue of preserving this great historical site. As many may know, Tyre, Lebanon was one of the most important cities in the classical era. It served as an administrative center of life for the people of the Mediterranean region, and was the birthplace for the modern day alphabet and democracy. If restored to its original beauty, and its antiquities are carefully unearthed and preserved, Tyre could become a world center for cultural education of past civilizations. 
   I am pleased to serve as the Honorary Chairman of the American National Committee and I am honored to work with my colleague and friend, Senator Claiborne Pell, whose previous 20 years of leadership on this issue remains invaluable. 
   There is no dispute that underneath the present day soil of Tyre lies the great archeological treasures of eight successive civilizations: the Phoenician, Persian, Roman, Greek, Byzantine, Arab, and Ottoman, as well as that of the Crusaders. Many attempts have been made to unearth these treasures, but present day realities have made it very difficult to implement a full fledged plan to discover these antiquities. 
   Tyre has been designated as a World Heritage site, and as such, should be treated with great respect for the education of future generations. The Government of Lebanon is searching for ways to protect the archeological sites while planning realistically for economic expansion and tourism. However there are problems. 
   The Lebanese Government recently approved building the southern extension of the coastal highway near many of the archeological treasures. The government has also permitted some of the coastal sea area to be refilled for the construction of parking lots. In addition, there has been damaging activity surrounding Tell El-Mashouk. 
   It is my hope that the Lebanese government will institute a master plan, cultural resources assessment, and a management plan for Tyre which will clearly map out the best approach at uncovering, preserving, and displaying these vast treasures. I do hope that the government will cease it present activity in the area until it can develop a workable and enforceable plan. 
   It seems a particularly appropriate time for the Lebanese Government to be planning their approach to the city of Tyre. With the Israeli withdrawal from the South of Lebanon, and peace close at hand, Lebanon can begin the process of rebuilding through tourism. It is my hope that part of the agenda to rebuild Southern Lebanon includes the preservation of the great city of Tyre and its surroundings, and I offer my assistance to do what I can in the United States to help the government of Lebanon achieve this goal.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, each year, the American Jewish Committee's Metropolitan Detroit Chapter presents one individual with its Judge Learned Hand Human Relations Award. Recipients of this award are honored for their outstanding leadership within the legal profession, and for exemplifying the high principles for which Judge Learned Hand was renowned. I rise today to recognize Mr. Lloyd A. Semple, who will receive the 2000 Judge Learned Hand Award on June 29, 2000, in Detroit, Michigan. 
   Mr. Semple is the Chairman of one of Detroit's oldest and most prestigious law firms, Dykema Gossett, PLLC. Founded in 1926, Dykema Gossett provides legal services to a broad range of clients, from international and Fortune 500 companies to individuals and small ``Mom and Pop'' businesses. Its mission has remained constant throughout its almost seventy-five years: to provide the best possible legal advice and service to its clients. The firm has grown over 270 lawyers strong, and now has locations in the following Michigan cities: Ann Arbor, Bloomfield Hills, Grand Rapids, and Lansing; as well as offices in Chicago and Washington, D.C. In addition, Dykema Gossett has recently gone global, forming an affiliation with a firm in Bologna, Italy. 
   In his time as Chairman, Mr. Semple has overseen this growth and adaptation to the ``new economy'' while at the same time stressing the importance of pro bono work to the members and associates of Dykema Gossett. Twice in recent years the law firm has been recognized by the Detroit Metropolitan Bar Association for its efforts in this regard. In 1998, Dykema Gossett was selected by the Business Law Section of the American Bar Association as the firm that made the most outstanding pro bono contribution in the United States in transactional and business related areas. In addition, members and associates donate their time and resources to a host of charitable and civic organizations, recognizing the importance of being not only a community member, but a community leader. Much of this is attributable, I think, to the strong leadership of Mr. Semple, and his belief that a good business should also strive to be a good neighbor. 
   Mr. Semple himself practices general corporate law, including acquisitions, divestitures, mergers and financings. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale University, and his Jurist Doctorate from the University of Michigan. He is a member of the Detroit Metropolitan Bar Association, the American Bar Association, and the State Bar of Michigan. He is a Director and/or Officer of Interface Systems, Inc., Sensys Technologies Inc., Tracy Industries, Inc., and Civix, Inc. 
   In addition, Mr. Semple serves as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Detroit Medical Center; Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Detroit Zoological Society; and is a Trustee of Detroit Symphony Orchestra Hall. He is the Director and Corporate Secretary, as well as a Trustee, of the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Center, an organization which raises funds for the awareness and prevention of breast cancer. He has served as Chairman of the Board of Harper Hospital, Councilman and Mayor Pro Tem of the City of Grosse Pointe Farms, President of the Yale Alumni Association of Michigan and President of the Country Club of Detroit. 
   I applaud Mr. Semple on his many achievements within the realm of the law, and his many charitable endeavors outside of that realm. Not only the City of Detroit, but the entire State of Michigan, has benefitted from his many great works. On behalf of the United States Senate, I congratulate Mr. Lloyd A. Semple on receiving the 2000 Judge Learned Hand Award, and wish him continued success in the future.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am proud to rise today as an original cosponsor of the Violence Against Women Act of 2000, and I urge my colleagues to join with us in this effort to ensure the safety and protection of women and families. 
   The 1994 Violence Against Women Act has been crucial in reducing violence perpetrated against women and families across America. VAWA '94 increased resources for training and law enforcement, and bolstered prosecution of child abuse, sexual assault, and domestic violence cases. States have changed the way they treat crimes of violence against women; 24 states and the District of Columbia now mandate arrest for most domestic violence offenses. States are lifting some of the costs to women associated with violence, and as a result of VAWA, all have some provision for covering the cost of a forensic rape exam. 
   And notably, VAWA '94 provided much-needed support for shelters and crisis centers, and created a National Domestic Violence Hotline. 
   Yet, despite the advances made as a result of the original Violence Against Women Act, violence against women remains a critical problem in our country. Recent studies show 307,000 incidents of rape and sexual assaults were perpetrated in 1998 alone. Over one million women are stalked annually. Violence by intimates accounts for 20% of all violent crimes against women. 
   It is essential that we reauthorize VAWA now, so that we can continue the initiatives that have made a difference, and so that we can further protect women and children from violence. 
   VAWA 2000 combines a variety of law-enforcement initiatives with support and prevention programs, in an effort to eradicate both the causes and effects of violence against women and families. The bill would ensure that those who regularly interact with victims of domestic violence--the courts, police, and social service providers--receive excellent training in reversing the destructive effects of domestic violence. As too many families are turned away in time of great need, VAWA 2000 offers increased funding to expand shelter services for families escaping violence. And in addition to providing emergency shelter, VAWA reauthorization provides for short-term and transitional housing, providing women and families real alternatives to returning to abusive homes. 
   Finally, VAWA '94 enabled immigrant victims of domestic violence to gain lawful permanent residence in the U.S. without the knowledge, participation, or cooperation of their abusive citizen or permanent resident spouses. Although the spirit and intent of this law was to facilitate the prosecution of  abusers, and to allow women and children to safely escape violence and rebuild their lives, unintended legal barriers have prevented the full protection of VAWA '94 from taking effect. VAWA 2000 cures this fault, and continues the spirit and work that began with the bi-partisan passage of VAWA '94. 
   Mr. President, it is essential that these programs be reauthorized, so that we may stop the cycles of violence and poverty that result from domestic violence. I urge my colleagues to support VAWA 2000, and I look forward to working with the members of the Judiciary Committee in bringing this important legislation to the floor as soon as possible.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on June 25, 1950, Communist North Korea invaded South Korea with approximately 135,000 troops, and in doing so initiated the Korean War. On June 25, 2000, the citizens of Traverse City, Michigan, will commemorate the 50th Anniversary of this unfortunate event, and will recognize the efforts of the many men and women who served the United States Armed Forces during the Korean War, with the dedication of a Korean War Memorial. 
   The Korean War is often referred to as our ``forgotten war.'' Fought between World War II and the Vietnam War, I believe it safely can be said that it never found its proper place among our Nation's history textbooks. This weekend, the 50th Anniversary of the North Korean invasion, provides all of us with an opportunity to take a moment to recognize the men and women who served in the Korean War--nearly six million individuals. Their sacrifices and contributions for the sake of our Nation must never be overlooked or forgotten. 
   Earlier this year, I was very pleased to co-sponsor Senate Joint Resolution 39, a bicameral resolution that recognizes the 50th Anniversary of the Korean War, and the service by the members of our Armed Forces during that conflict. Today, I am pleased to do my part to ensure that the Korean War ceases to be thought of as our ``forgotten war.'' There is no doubt in my mind--and there should be no doubt in anyone else's--that the men and women who served in Korea, and particularly the 54,260 soldiers who gave their lives in Korea, deserve much better than that. 
   Local communities can do much to remedy the situation as well. I commend Traverse City, Michigan, for constructing this Korean War memorial, and for taking the opportunity on Sunday, June 25, 2000, to pay tribute to the men and women who served during the Korean War. We must show these men and women that we appreciate their efforts and sacrifices on behalf on our great Nation, and that we thank them for their extraordinary efforts. In doing this, we will illustrate to them that they have not been forgotten; rather, the case is far from this. 
   Mr. President, the men and women who served our Nation in Korea did so at a time when its very foundation--democracy--was being threatened by the terrible force of communism. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate the citizens of Traverse City, Michigan, for recognizing and honoring this service.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. As the Senator knows, I have a special interest in the provision of the bill that provides $15 million for development activities in Lebanon, including support for the American educational institutions there. I am pleased that this year that level of funding is maintained in the bill as it was reported from committee, and I wish to thank the Senator from Kentucky for his leadership and the interest that he too has taken in Lebanon's future. 
   As you know, earmarking $15 million in economic assistance is an important beginning to a comprehensive aid package to Lebanon. However, the recent events in the South of Lebanon call for a more detailed and larger aid package to Lebanon. 
   A larger aid package can help the country rebuild itself due to the devastation of the past 30 years. Specifically, Lebanon needs the financial assistance to: rebuild its schools; repair and rebuild its sewage systems; repair its destroyed power generation plants; upgrade its water purification facilities; and construct general infrastructure projects. 
   In my opinion, a package similar to the recent Jordanian package of $250 million would provide the type of support needed to effectively launch the rebuilding effort. 
   Unfortunately, it appears that the Administration is not currently prepared to present a comprehensive aid package. Several inquiries of the Administration have produced no budgetary figures. This is disappointing in that your legislation is clearly the appropriate vehicles in which to include this funding. Notwithstanding their reluctance, I would like to offer my amendment to increase Lebanon's funding to $250 million.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on July 2, 2000, a very special event will take place in Sterling Heights, Michigan: the first reunion of United States citizens who trace their roots back to the town of Pacentro, Italy. Over 800 people will attend the event, some of them with ancestors who immigrated to the United States over 150 years ago. In addition, the Mayor of Pacentro himself, Mr. Fernando Caparso, will be attending the event. I rise today to welcome Mr. Caparso to the State of Michigan. 
   Pacentro is a small town located east of Rome. It sits in the Abruzzo region in the province of L'Aquila. Born in medieval times, the town is famous for its three castle towers, the oldest of which was built by Count Boarmondo and dates back to the thirteenth century. Another dates from the fifteenth century, and is recognized as the loveliest castle in the region. More recently, Pacentro has gained fame as the birthplace of the rock star Madonna's grandparents. 
   Mr. Caparso was born there on February 12, 1951, to Antonio and Rosina Fabiilli. He was one of five children; three sisters remain in Pacentro and the oldest sister resides in Washington, Michigan. 
   After completing high school in Pacentro, Mr. Caparso graduated from Liceo Classico Ocidio in Sulmona, Italy. He followed his studies there at La Sapienza University in Rome, where he received a doctorate degree. Finally, he attended Gabriele d'Annunzio University in Chieti, where he specialized in sports medicine. Mr. Caparso is presently caring for three towns in the Abruzzo region: Secinaro, Gagliano Aterno and Castel Di Ieri. 
   The sport of soccer has also played a very large role in Mr. Caparso's life. While completing his studies, he always played for an amateur team in the Peligna Valley Region. And, when his playing days were behind him, he became a referee. Mr. Caparso has refereed women's major league games throughout Italy, and is currently the President of the Sulmona Referee Administration. 
   Mr. Caparso was elected Mayor of Pacentro in 1999. Having decided that the city needed a better administration, an administration which tended to the needs of all its citizens, he further decided to do something about it. Mr. Caparso was elected Mayor along with a list of conservative councilmen. 
   Mr. President, I am sure that the Pacentro, Italy, Reunion 2000 will be a wonderful success. I know that a great number of individuals have put their hearts and souls into this reunion, and I applaud their many efforts. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I welcome Mr. Fernando Caparso, Mayor of Pacentro, Italy, to the State of Michigan.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dr. Denise Davis-Cotton, who will be honored this morning during the Millennium Commencement Ceremony at Detroit Symphony Orchestra Hall. Dr. Davis-Cotton is  being honored for her many contributions to the Detroit Public School System. In particular, she will be honored for her role as the founding principal of the Detroit High School for the Fine and Performing Arts, and for the work she has done in this capacity. 
   In founding the Detroit High School for the Fine and Performing Arts, which opened its doors to students in the fall of 1992, Dr. Davis-Cotton established a unique center for learning: a small inner city public school dedicated primarily to the study of the arts. She designed the school curriculum, developed its program components, and wrote the philosophy and mission statement for the school, all of which are based upon a strong commitment to the study of the arts. 
   After an initial application process, students are asked to audition in one of the following areas: instrumental music, vocal music, speech and theater, dance or visual arts. Only after this audition are students accepted to the school. Upon acceptance, students partake in a rigorous college preparatory curriculum, along with an intensive study in their selected art field. 
   The results of this demanding program have been resoundingly successful. 100 percent of the first graduating class received acceptance to college; the school holds a 97 percent student retention rate; a 95 percent student attendance rate; and the Class of 2000 had an overall grade point average of 3.08. Mr. President, the 107 students who comprised the Class of 1998 were awarded seven and a half million dollars in scholarships and grants for higher education. The school has had national champions in Academic Games and the Tri-Math-A-Lon, and its Forensics Team has won the Michigan State Championship four consecutive years. 
   Another important aspect of the Detroit High School for the Fine and Performing Arts is the unique relationship the school has formed with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. Through this partnership, students have been given the opportunity to work with jazz greats Brandford Marsalis and Frank Foster; award winning composer Alvin Singleton; Detroit Symphony Orchestra Music Director Neeme Jarvi; and Detroit Symphony Orchestra Assistant Conductor Ya-Hui-Wang. In addition to instrumental students studying privately with members of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, an annual joint concert is presented featuring Detroit High School for the Fine and Performing Arts and Detroit Symphony Orchestra. 
   This partnership was taken to an even higher level in 1996. With financial assistance from the Detroit Medical Center, an $80 million dollar project was undertaken, to be called Orchestra Place. Orchestra Place, when completed, will be an office, retail, education and arts complex centered around the historic home of the Detroit Symphony, Orchestra Hall. It will also include the new home of the Detroit High School for the Fine and Performing Arts. It is expected to be an important regional performing arts complex, which will offer professional and student performances in the world class Orchestra Hall. 
   Mr. President, all of these many accomplishments would not have been possible were it not for the many efforts and the incredible vision of Dr. Denise Davis-Cotton. Not only has she provided the youth of Detroit with an entirely new opportunity in education, she has also provided the nation with a blueprint for success in inner city public education. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Dr. Davis-Cotton on her many contributions to the State of Michigan, and wish her continued success in the future.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I first thank the Senator from Maine for her steadfast efforts to raise these issues over a fairly lengthy period of time now. I also think we should, perhaps, review some of the recent history. As my colleague from Michigan just indicated, it is clearly not just in Maine or Michigan but across the country, in almost every part of the country, the No.  1 issue on people's minds today--what it costs to fill up one's automobile or sports utility vehicle with gasoline. 
   In my case, like many other fathers with young children, we have a minivan. When we go to the pump now, it is somewhere between $40 and $50 to fill up our tank. There seems to be a pattern in our region--Michigan, Illinois, and some of the other States in the Great Lakes--that have driven the prices even higher than the national average. I share the concerns my colleague from Michigan and colleague from Illinois have expressed with respect to why this is affecting uniquely our State. I have asked the Secretary of Energy to meet personally on this issue to find out what insights he provides. 
   I think a few other issues need to be discussed. First, I think the points that have been raised with respect to releasing some of the petroleum in our strategic reserve make sense. This is a way to make an immediate impact, to have an immediate impact on the supply of oil which, in turn, will relate to the price. There are a lot of things we can do that will have a long-term impact, but the short-term impact is fairly limited. 
   No. 1, we can tap the reserve. No. 2, we can suspend, as we have on several occasions tried to vote to do, the Federal gasoline taxes to reduce some of the costs the consumers are paying. 
   But I think there is an issue we need to talk about as well, that has more of a long-term consideration to it, and that is the dependency of our country on foreign sources of energy. The fact is, even if you level out the prices for the Great Lakes, if the problems in our region were to be resolved in such a fashion that we simply returned to the approximate level of the rest of the country, we would still be paying substantially higher prices than we did a year ago. There is no question the reason for that is the OPEC nations' decisions with respect to supply is the cause of these higher prices. While I think we should investigate whether it is the oil companies or anyone else who may be taking advantage of the supply situation in some inappropriate way, I think we must try to wean ourselves from the dependency we have on foreign energy sources. 
   I believe we have a responsibility as a Congress to work on issues related to this. 
   I believe the administration has a responsibility, which it has not fulfilled in over 7 years in office, to provide us with a long-term energy policy that prevents dependency from getting any worse. In the 1970s, when we had an energy crisis that led to lines at the fuel pumps, that led to shortages, we were only 35-percent dependent on foreign energy. Today, we are 55-percent dependent. At the current rate, we will hit 60 percent in the near future. 
   There is no question that if we place ourselves in that position, we will be at the mercy of the decisionmaking of foreign countries with respect to our energy costs. I do not think we want to be in that position as a nation. I do not think we want to have our Energy Secretary, irrespective of to which administration he or she might belong, be forced to go hat in hand, as Secretary Richardson recently was required to do, to persuade foreign countries to give America a little bit more of a supply. The only way to address that is to change policies at home that allow for domestic production to increase that will permit us to tap into alternative energy sources and to conserve more energy. 
   That, I believe, ought to occupy as much attention as anything else we do in this area. To address the long-term needs, in my judgment, is the top energy policy on which we should right now be focused as a Congress and as a nation. 
   We need a multifaceted approach. In the short run, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve can give us immediate relief on some of the prices. I believe we should, again, consider suspending the gas tax as another way to do that for the short run. Until and unless we demonstrate as a nation a commitment to increasing our own domestic production, we are going to send a signal to these other nations that they are going to have the leverage they can use when they wish to make more profits for themselves at our expense, and instead of American consumers being in charge, it will be foreign oil ministers who make those decisions. 
   That is wrong. I intend to fight that, and I intend to be back on the floor as much as it takes on these issues until we begin to focus on that aspect of the problem. 
   Let's say the national average in the region--which does not include Michigan, Ohio, and Illinois--if that average fuel price was the price in my State, $1.50 to $1.60 a gallon, it would still be too high, in my opinion. The only way it is going to change is if we address the long-term issues as well. 
   I thank the Senator from Maine for her amendment and her efforts. I look forward to working with her on this issue. I yield the floor.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, we are obviously in the midst of an ongoing discussion that has been held on a number of occasions here over the issue of CAFE standards and this motion, obviously, to instruct the Senate conferees to either modify or strike the moratorium on CAFE standards in the House bill. 
   I rise to speak in opposition to this motion to instruct. 
   Let me begin, first, by outlining the case against raising corporate fuel economy standards, or CAFE. Then what I would like to discuss is what would actually happen as a matter of law if the CAFE freeze were lifted. 
   First, increased CAFE requirements would cost American auto workers their jobs. 
   They put American automobile manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis foreign manufacturers. Let me explain what I mean by this. 
   The Federal Government currently mandates that auto manufacturers maintain an average fuel economy of 27.5 miles per gallon for cars and 20.7 miles per gallon for minivans, sport utility vehicles, and light trucks. To meet increased CAFE requirements, automakers must make design and material changes to their vehicles. Those changes cost money. They force American manufacturers to build cars that are smaller, less powerful, less popular to consumers, and, as I will indicate in a moment and as several of the preceding speakers have noted, less safe. 
   In 1992, the National Academy of Sciences found that raising CAFE requirements to 35 miles per gallon would increase the average vehicle's cost by about $2,500. Japanese automakers have escaped these costs because sky high gasoline prices in their home markets forced them to make smaller, lighter cars years ago. Increased CAFE requirements will continue to favor Japanese automakers, and that means they will continue to place an uneven burden on American automobile workers. 
   The American auto industry accounts for one in seven U.S. jobs. Steel, transportation, electronics, literally dozens of industries employing thousands upon thousands of Americans depend on the health of our auto industry. It is not just people in Michigan or people in Ohio; it is people across our Nation whose livelihoods are linked to the success of the American automobile manufacturing industry. 
   In their letter of June 7, the United Auto Workers wrote:  
   *.*.* further increases in CAFE could lead to the loss of thousands of jobs at automotive plants across this country that are associated with the production of SUVs, light trucks and full size automobiles.  
   In a June 9 letter, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters writes: The CAFE program has not helped manufacturers reduce U.S. consumption of gasoline.  
   Instead, it has created competitive disadvantages for the very companies that provide job opportunities for millions of Americans.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. In addition, raising CAFE standards will cost lives. On the issue of vehicle safety, for a number of years, the Federal Government has taken the lead in mandating additional safety features on automobiles in an attempt to reduce the number of lives lost in auto accidents. How ironic to learn that Federal CAFE requirements have been costing lives all this time. 
   The Competitive Enterprise Institute estimates that between 2,700 and 4,500 drivers and passengers die every year as a result of CAFE-induced auto downsizing. Last year, USA Today, in a special section devoted to the issue of CAFE standards and auto safety, calculated CAFE's cumulative death toll at 46,000 lives. Even the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration, which runs the CAFE program, has recognized the deadly effects of CAFE standards. In its publication ``Small Car Safety in the 1980s,'' NHTSA explains that smaller cars are less crash worthy than large ones, even in single-vehicle accidents. Small cars have twice the death rate of drivers and passengers in crashes as larger cars, and smaller light trucks will mean even more fatalities. These trucks and SUVs have higher centers of gravity and so they are more prone to rollovers. If SUV and truck weights are reduced, thousands more will die. 
   On the safety issue, two additional items: First of all, it is true that since CAFE standards came into effect, the overall death rates on our roads have gotten better. However, this fails to note some pretty significant information. We have had safety belts and airbags, a variety of other safety devices included and, in some cases, mandated for usage in automobiles and other vehicles. Our roads have gotten better. For all these reasons, the overall cumulative effect in terms of safety has been better over the last 25 years. But the studies that have specifically focused on the impact of CAFE standards, the impact of lighter vehicles, the impact of less crash-resistant vehicles has shown that the problem in terms of CAFE is not to make cars and vehicles more safe but to make them less so. That is the bottom line. 
   Moreover, in relationship to SUVs in particular, these are vehicles that are more crash prone. Therefore, the notion of making them less safe as a product of a CAFE reform effort would be a strike at the heart of the safety of the American motorist. 
   In addition, increased CAFE standards reduce consumer choice. CAFE averages are determined by the buying pattern of the American public. U.S. automakers are challenged by the current CAFE standards because the American consumer has demonstrated time and again a preference for minivans and SUVs, even though alternatives that are more fuel efficient are readily available. We don't need Government mandates to force automakers to produce fuel-efficient cars. If consumers want vehicles which get better gas mileage no matter what the cost of gasoline, they have a wide choice of vehicles from which to choose. 
   If, as the supporters of new CAFE standards contend, consumers crave more fuel-efficient vehicles, then more small cars and vehicles would be purchased. It is supply and demand. Yet despite a variety of choices for fuel-efficient vehicles which get as much as 40 to 50 miles per gallon, these vehicles account for less than 1 percent of total vehicle sales. Why? The answer is simple: The public demands the convenience of vehicles with a larger carrying capacity and vehicles that are safer. These vehicles, minivans, and SUVs are the class of 
   vehicle that will be eliminated should new CAFE standards be enacted, and the livelihood of the thousands of Americans employed in the production of such vehicles will be threatened. 
   The Americans Farm Bureau writes:  
   Full size pickups are the tools of the agricultural trade and they do, indeed, haul everything from bales of hay to farm equipment to livestock feed on an every day basis. Higher CAFE standards would almost inevitably lead to less powerful engines and weaker frames and suspension or even the elimination of some full size truck models.  
   We should continue to let the market, not the Government, choose the  types of vehicles produced by American automobile manufacturers. Consumers will suffer if their choices are narrowed. Automakers and their employees will suffer if they are forced to make cars the public simply does not want. 
   Again, on the choice issue, this is precisely what happened when the CAFE standards were first adopted. In a statement before the Consumer Subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee, Dr. Marina Whitman of General Motors noted:  
   In 1982, we were forced to close two assembly plants which had been fully converted to produce our new highly fuel efficient compact and mid-size cars. The cost of the conversions was $130 million. But the plants were closed because demands for those cars did not develop during the period of sharply declining gasoline prices.  
   Our automakers simply cannot afford to pay the fines imposed on them if they fail to reach CAFE standards or to build cars that Americans won't buy. In either case, the real victims are American workers and American consumers. Proponents of CAFE argue that it will reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil and gasoline consumption. Since the program was enacted 25 years ago, the U.S. fleet average fuel economy has more than doubled. However, U.S. oil imports have risen from 36 percent to over 50 percent, and gasoline consumption has increased during that very same timeframe. 
   Thus raising CAFE will not reduce our dependency on foreign oil, but it will reduce job opportunities, consumer choice, and the automobile safety we presently enjoy. 
   Mr. President, let me explain why the entire CAFE issue itself is almost obsolete. In just a few years, American automobile workers, working individually as well as through partnerships with Government, academia, and suppliers, will be bringing to the market advanced fuel-efficient technologies--cars powered by electric, hybrid electric, clean burn, and fuel cell engines, and other promising new technologies. Toyota became the first manufacturer to mass produce a hybrid electric passenger car, the Prius, which will be on sale in the U.S. later this year. Several companies, such as Volkswagon, are already selling vehicles that utilize advanced technology to achieve 40 to 50 percent greater fuel efficiency than conventional gasoline-powered vehicles without sacrificing performance. 
   American automobile manufacturers are close behind. They continue to invest almost $1 billion every year in research to develop more fuel-efficient vehicles, and those efforts will soon bear fruit. In fact, just today, GM announced it will offer a fuel-efficient SUV capable of handling ethanol-based fuel. As we heard from previous speakers, the Ford Motor Company is in the process of bringing forth vehicles which will be hybrid fuel efficient within just a few years. 
   Clearly, there already exists fierce competition among automakers to market more fuel-efficient vehicles. So why should we even consider turning to the punitive and disruptive methods of Federal mandates through CAFE standards to increase fuel efficiency for American vehicles. This is going to happen, Mr. President. The market will drive it, and it will be done in the most efficient fashion if we allow the companies to do what they are already in the process of accomplishing, instead of grabbing control in Washington and once again dictating through a bureaucracy the way America ought to do business. 
   Since 1993, the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles has brought together Government agencies and the auto industry to conduct joint research, research that is making significant progress that will breach the gap to real world applications after 2000. By enhancing research cooperation, PNGV is helping our auto industry develop vehicles more easily recyclable, have lower emissions, and can achieve up to triple the fuel efficiency of today's mid-size family sedans--all this while producing cars that retain performance, utility, safety, and economy. 
   Mr. President, we are making solid progress--progress toward making vehicles that achieve greater fuel economy without sacrificing the qualities consumers demand or the safety we should all expect, progress that will render CAFE requirements obsolete. 
   Mr. President, I want to address the contention that lifting the CAFE freeze will simply allow the Department of Transportation to study the need to raise CAFE standards. Of course, that sounds rather benign on its face, and a study alone is something we do often around here. But the way the rules and the law are currently set up, that is simply not the case. As a matter of law, lifting the freeze will lead to higher CAFE standards on sports utility vehicles and light trucks. Public Law 94-163, the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, requires the Department of Transportation to set CAFE standards each year at--get this, Mr. President--the maximum feasible average fuel economy level. 
   The Secretary is not authorized to just study CAFE. The 
   Secretary must act by regulation to set new CAFE standards each year. The last year prior to the CAFE freeze--1994--the administration began rulemaking on new CAFE standards. DOT's April 6, 1994, proposal referenced feasible higher CAFE levels for trucks of 15 to 35 percent above the current standard. Since 1995, Congress has refused to allow DOT to unilaterally increase the standards, as it has in the past. 
   We have recognized that it is our duty as legislators to make policy in this important area of economic and environmental concern. I believe that very strongly. I think it ought to be the Congress that steps up to the responsibility of making these kinds of determinations, which have such overriding and such pervasive impact on the economy of virtually every one of the 50 States. 
   Now, however, the proposal before us would move us back in the direction of delegating these critical economic decisions to the bureaucracy, the Department of Transportation. The automobile industry is a critical component of our overall economy. Indeed, the future of our economic growth depends on the continued health of the automobile manufacturing sector. That is why I believe that we in Congress should make the policy decisions related to CAFE, not regulators at the Department of Transportation, or anywhere else. 
   In summary, raising CAFE standards for light trucks and SUVs will cost American jobs. It will undermine our automobile industry's global competitiveness. It will compromise passenger safety. It will reduce consumer choice, and it will not reduce America's dependence on foreign oil sources. Nor, in my judgment, as I think some of our colleagues who will soon be speaking will indicate, will it make that much of an impact with respect to fuel efficiency. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote against this motion to instruct the conferees to strike the CAFE freeze provision. 
   I yield the floor and withhold the remainder of our time.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I know we want to move as quickly as possible to the digital signature, e-signature legislation. Obviously, we have to finish the action on the proposed motion to instruct. My comment on the proposal submitted by the Senator from Washington is that I think it moves in a very positive direction. 
   I have introduced legislation in the Senate for the past several Congresses, attempting to establish what I consider to be a more appropriate way of considering issues related to corporate average fuel economy. Specifically, I feel the current considerations are not broad enough. We do not take into account--as I indicated in my speech earlier today--the impact on employment in the United States and, more specifically, in the automotive industry. We do not take into account safety; we do not take into account similar factors that matter to the people I represent. 
   The proposal is to have a study conducted by the National Academy of Sciences that would look specifically at those considerations, as well as many others that the Academy or the conference committee would recommend--as the Senator from Washington indicated in the colloquy with my colleague from Michigan--and other criteria that we have included in legislation that I have introduced in this and previous Congresses. 
   The other thing which I have always felt is relevant to this process is how the role of Congress should be enhanced. I mentioned this earlier today in my remarks. I believe something as directly significant to the economy of the United States as the automobile industry, and specifically the CAFE standards' impact on that industry, are issues that Congress ought to have an ultimate role in addressing. I am happy the provisions here would subject any changes--at least in this fiscal year--to the approval of Congress by a joint resolution. I think that makes a lot of sense, because that would put the elected officials of this country--not the unelected bureaucrats of this country--in the position of making the significant determinations that will impact our economy. 
   For both those reasons I think this approach makes sense for this fiscal year. It keeps intact the freeze which we have had in recent years, so there will not be an increase or change in corporate average fuel economy standard generated through the process that has existed under United States Code. But at the same time, it does provide those who wanted a study the opportunity to have one conducted by the National Academy of Sciences. It also gives Congress a much more direct role in any changes that might occur during the upcoming year. And it does, I think, acknowledge the very important criteria beyond simply the question of appropriate levels of fuel economy--criteria like safety, criteria like employment. Criteria that relate to our economy would also be taken into consideration. 
   So I believe this makes sense as now submitted to this body. I hope we can quickly act on it.

Mr. President, I wish to indicate I was actually speaking on the floor at the time that the initial exchange of documents took place, but from the point at which I concluded my remarks and began discussing this issue with the Senator from Michigan and the Senator from Washington, it was certainly my understanding that the intention, and certainly our side's intention, in urging the word ``recommend'' be employed was to make precisely the distinction which my colleague from Michigan just indicated. Certainly there was an important element to that change from my point of view, as I know there was from his. 
   I am hopeful as the process moves forward that it will do so in the constructive way we have outlined. We ought to make clear a rulemaking procedure is where ``a proposed set of rules'' would be the term of art used. For a study, which is what we intended here--a recommendation is different from the proposal that might stem from an actual rulemaking. That is my interpretation of the discussions in which I at least took part.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am proud to rise this evening to discuss legislation that I am very confident we will pass tomorrow--the conference report to S. 761, the Electronic Signatures and Global National Commerce Act. 
   This is the culmination of nearly two years' effort, and I deeply appreciate all of the generous assistance on the part of my colleagues who helped move this bill through the legislative process. 
   I believe that hindsight will prove this to be one of the most important pieces of legislation to emerge from the 106th Congress. This legislation will eliminate the single most significant vulnerability of electronic commerce, which is the fear that everything it revolves around--electronic signatures, contracts, and other records--could be rendered invalid solely by virtue of their being in ``electronic'' form, rather than in a tangible, ink and paper format. 
   This bill will literally supply the pavement for the e-commerce lane of the information superhighway. What we do today truly changes tomorrow, and I am certain that this legislation will prove to have a tremendous positive impact on electronic commerce--and on the general health of our economy--for decades to come. 
   Mr. President, thanks to the development of secure electronic signatures and records, individuals, businesses, and even governments are increasingly able to enter transactions without ever having to travel--whether the travel is a short drive across town or a thousand-mile flight. They are turning on a computer and opening e-mail, rather than scheduling drop-offs at mailboxes or pick-ups from courier services. 
   They are able to transact now, rather than ``tomorrow, before 10AM'', or over the next few days, depending on mail volume (and, of course, except for on Sunday). They are paying transactions costs in the fractions of cents, rather than in 33 cent increments. And as we move forth into the electronic world, ``they'' will increasingly include even the smallest businesses and consumers, who will find themselves able to take advantage of many of the technologies and efficiencies available only to the largest of firms. 
   Even now, consumers are realizing the time and cost benefits of electronic commerce at a rapidly escalating rate. On-line catalogs are everywhere, all the time, and always in competition to provide the best service at the lowest price. And for the average family in America, on-line lending and real estate brokerage services are making the most significant of all purchases--the purchase of a family home--available over the Internet. Changes to home-buying over the near term will be dramatic. Rapid document and service delivery will reduce a transaction typically measured in days or weeks to minutes or hours, and the ability of a consumer to quickly assess the rates offered by scores of lenders will increase competition and lower mortgage costs and rates for every consumer. Mr. President, Franklin Raines, the Chairman and CEO of Fannie Mae, told an investor conference in May that ``..... the application of electronic commerce to the U.S. mortgage finance industry should help the U.S. homeownership rate reach 70 percent over the next decade.'' Mr. President, and Chairman Raines, I look forward to that future. 
   But for e-commerce to continue growing, we must have a consistent, predictable, national framework of rules governing the use of electronic signatures and records. Current legal inconsistencies are deterring businesses from fully utilizing electronic signature technologies. And the ability of one court, in one jurisdiction, to rule against the validity of a contract solely because of its electronic form threatens to destabilize the entirety of electronic commerce--bringing down the whole house of cards. 
   The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Law has developed a uniform system for the use of electronic signatures. Their product, the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, or UETA, is an excellent piece of work and I look forward to its enactment in all fifty states. But as some state legislatures are not in session next year, and as other states face more immediately pressing issues, it will likely take three to four years for all the states to enact the UETA. 
   That is a long time in the high-technology sector--far too long to permit, when this Congress possesses the ability to bridge the gap. 
   With this in mind, Mr. President, in November of 1998--shortly after the passage of the first electronic signature legislation, the Government Paperwork Elimination Act, which I also co-authored with my friend, Senator WYDEN--I initiated a series of discussions with both industry and states for the purpose of developing a plan to foster the continued growth of electronic signatures and electronic commerce. In January of 1999, my staff had produced draft legislation which I invited Chairman BLILEY to consider introducing in the House of Representatives. Over the next several months, Senator WYDEN and I worked with Republicans and Democrats in both chambers to refine this legislation. On March 25 of 1999,  Senators WYDEN, MCCAIN, BURNS, LOTT, and I introduced the ``Millennium Digital Commerce Act'' (S. 761); Representative ANNA ESHOO introduced the House companion later that day. My staff continued to consult with Chairman BLILEY in order to refine our substantive approach to this issue, and his electronic signature legislation, H.R. 1714, was introduced on May 6, 1999. As I noted, S. 761 was the first electronic signature bill introduced in the 106th Congress. Thanks to the gracious assistance of Chairman MCCAIN, our bill received its first hearing in the Senate Commerce Committee on May 27 of last year. On June 23 it was passed out of the Commerce Committee on a unanimous 19-0 vote. I would note that the version of the bill passed out by the Committee included provisions regarding both electronic signatures and electronic records. 
   During the fall of 1999, we made several attempts to pass this bill by unanimous consent agreement in the Senate, but unfortunately, we were unable to proceed because several Members had concerns relating to the inclusion of electronic records in the legislation. Given our need to accommodate the Senate's schedule, we made a decision to pass a substitute bill that excluded the records provisions, and the Abraham-Wyden-Leahy substitute amendment passed the Senate unanimously on November 19, 1999. 
   At the time the Senate passed S. 761, Senator LOTT and I made clear our intention to work for inclusion of electronic records provisions in the final bill. I am pleased to say that with much effort, the bill is being passed today as conceived nearly two years ago--granting legal certainty to both electronic records and signatures. 
   Mr. President, at this point I would like to speak to several of the key principles of this legislation, which I believe will provide the legal framework needed for the continued growth of e-commerce. 
   The general rule of this legislation ensures the legal certainty of e-commerce in very clear, targeted terms: ``a signature, contract, or other record ..... may not be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form''. 
   Mr. President, the word ``solely'' is pivotal in this context: it means that electronic writings are not to be discriminated against, but instead are to be judged according to existing principles of contract law. 
   With this language, the ``achilles heel'' of all of e-commerce is protected--the ``electronic'' nature of a contract will not be used to attack the validity of a contract. 
   Mr. President, I view this as my single most important contribution to the future of electronic commerce, and would like to thank Senators MCCAIN, WYDEN, GRAMM, and HATCH for their counsel and support in writing this section of the legislation. 
   This section of the legislation was added to ensure that no ambiguity existed with respect to our treatment of existing 
   contract law. Although we strongly believe that our General Rule is formulated in the least onerous incarnation, Section 101(b) clarifies that principles of contract law, which have been established over a millennium of commerce, remain in effect and should continue to guide transactions nationwide. It is the strong belief of the conference that the decision whether or not to participate in electronic commerce is completely voluntary, and if the parties decide to do so, the bill grants parties to a transaction the freedom to determine the technologies and business methods to employ in the execution of an electronic contract or other record. 
   Under the consent provisions, a consumer must affirmatively consent to the provision of records in electronic form, and there must be a reasonable demonstration that the consumer can access electronic records. For the immediate future, the conference envisions this ``electronic consent'' to take the form of either a web-page based consumer affirmation, or a reply to a business' electronic mailing which includes an affirmation by the consumer that he or she could open provided attachments. I eagerly await future technology developments that render the burdens this section imposes on consumers and businesses obsolete. 
   This provision, in combination with the simple fact that the use of electronic records by a consumer and right to contract generally are completely voluntary, should ensure that no consumer will be forced by any business to accept any electronic document that the consumer does not wish to receive. 
   It is well worth noting that the term ``consumer'' does not include business-to-business transactions, which will allow businesses to take full advantage of the efficiency opportunities presented by this legislation. 
   As I have noted, the central purpose of this legislation is to establish a nation-wide baseline for the legal certainty of electronic signatures and records. The States themselves have recognized the need for uniformity in laws governing e-commerce, and in July of last year, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Law (NCCUSL) reported out model legislation designed to unify state law in a market-oriented, technology-neutral approach. I believe that the eventual adoption of UETA by all 50 states in a manner consistent with the version reported by NCCUSL will provide the same national uniformity which is established in the Federal legislation. For that reason, and at my insistence, when a state adopts the ``Uniform Electronic Transactions Act'' (UETA) as reported by NCCUSL, the federal preemption provided in this bill is superceded. In the meantime, the preemption contained in the Federal Act will ensure a uniform standard of legal certainty for both electronic signatures and electronic records. 
   Mr. President, I would like to address two additional points related to preemption. First, UETA includes a provision that permits a state to prescribe ``delivery methods'' for various records. I saw this as a potential loophole to the bill, which would allow a state to circumvent the intent of the general rule and require that an electronic document be delivered via physical methods--most likely ``first class'' mail. It should be clear to all that the federal legislation would not permit such a delivery method requirement, and we have specified as much in the preemption section. Second, I believed that the House version of the preemption was unnecessarily overbroad, and went so far as to seriously hamper the ability of a state or local government to perform those governing functions entrusted to it by the citizens. I am pleased that the conference agreed with my opinion, and that the language was changed in response. 
   The ``consumer protection'' provisions of this legislation specify that any notice of product recalls or cancellation, or termination of utility services, among other items, are to be excluded from the scope of this legislation. This means, of course, that the validity of these notices may be denied solely because they are in electronic form. I hope that industry does not shy away from providing these notices electronically--as well as in paper--as it seems to me that electronic ``anyplace, anytime'' notification of a product recall or utility shutoff would be extremely valuable. Especially to a resident of northern Michigan on business or vacation travel, whose furnace was subject to recall during the dead of winter. 
   Mr. President, because of the benefits of ``anyplace, anytime'' notice--and especially in light of the strong consent provisions in the bill--I believe consumers should be free to choose to receive any type record electronically, even those expressly precluded in this legislation. I hope the appropriate regulatory agencies will utilize the authority granted in this bill to allow all records, even those precluded from electronic transmission by this legislation, to be sent electronically. 
   The Legislation does not prevent states from establishing standards for electronic transactions with their constituents. Just as the Government Paperwork Elimination Act provided the Federal government the authority to set standards for electronic regulatory filing and reporting, so too should the States have the ability to set standards for electronic submission with a State or political subdivision. And, like any business, the Federal government and the States also have the ability to establish procedures and standards for procuring goods and services online. 
   The bill directs the Department of Commerce and Office of Management and Budget to report on Federal laws and regulations that might pose barriers to e-commerce and report back to  Congress on the impact of such provisions and provide suggestions for reform. Such a report will serve as the basis for Congressional action, or inaction, in the future. 
   This was one of the final sections of the language to be modified in response to my concerns. The original proposal by the Administration to deny legal validity for records required to be retained by Federal or State law or regulation until October 1, of 2001 was, in my opinion, needlessly excessive and punitive to those consumers and businesses prepared to leap now into the electronic age. I maintained that Federal and State agencies should be provided only six months time to develop standards to ensure document validity and integrity, so as to not inappropriately burden the private sector. Objective individuals outside the process with experience in developing and implementing regulations at the Federal and State level assured me that six months was feasible. In the end, however, we effectively agreed upon an eight-month delayed implementation. And finally, language which House negotiators insisted upon which would have needlessly created an uneven playing field for the financial services industry was also dropped at my request. 
   Since the Internet is inherently an international medium, consideration must be given to the manner in which the U.S. will conduct business with overseas governments and businesses. This legislation therefore sets forth a series of principles for the international use of electronic signatures. In the last year, U.S. negotiators have been meeting with the European Commissioners to discuss electronic signatures in international commerce. In these negotiations, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the State Department have worked in support of an open system governing the use of authentication technologies. Some European nations oppose this concept, however. For example, Germany insists that electronic transactions involving a German company must utilize a German electronic signature application. I applaud the Administration for their steadfast opposition to that approach. This bill will bolster and strengthen the U.S. position in these international negotiations by establishing the following principles as the will of the Congress:  
   One, paper-based obstacles to electronic transactions must be eliminated. 
   Two, parties to an electronic transaction should choose the electronic authentication technology. 
   Three, parties to a transaction should have the opportunity to prove in court that their authentication approach and transactions are valid. 
   Four, the international approach to electronic signatures should take a non-discriminatory approach to electronic signature. This will allow the free market--not a government--to determine the type of authentication technologies used in international commerce. 
   Mr. President, it is my hope that adoption of these principles will increase the likelihood of an open, market-based international framework for electronic commerce. 
   Mr. President, two years ago I believed that if we, as a body, could maintain a spirit of bipartisanship and a strong commitment to principles of free commerce, that we were poised to produce the landmark accomplishment of this Congress. Well we took these commitments seriously, and I believe our work product will be hailed for generations to come as the grounds upon which the dream of a prosperous new economy became a reality--and well beyond our expectations. 
   I am pleased to say that we have already begun work on the next legislative effort to help this nation shift to the electronic world, addressing the apportionment of liability for violations of duty and trust, and the protection of information and user confidentiality in electronic commerce. Mr. President, I welcome the help of my colleagues who have been with me in the effort to protect electronic signatures and records, I look forward to again working closely with the states and industry, and I hope to deliver to the American public corresponding legislation that is as well-contemplated and effective as S. 761 in the next Congress. 
   Before I close, there are a number of individuals whom I would like to thank for their hard work, and without exception, for their endurance. First, I would like to recognize Chairman MCCAIN for his assistance and dedication to this effort. The Chairman was one of the original cosponsors of this legislation, and lent a great deal of support well before any of the current attention was being paid to the issue of the legal certainty of electronic commerce. Senator MCCAIN's constant momentum eliminated many obstacles over the past 18 months and kept this process moving forward. 
   Without his efforts and those of Mark Buse and Maureen McLaughlin of the Senate Commerce Committee staff, I certainly wouldn't be making this statement today. 
   I would also like to sincerely thank my friend, Senator PHIL GRAMM, Chairman of our Banking Committee, whose dedication to those important principles of economic freedom was a key ingredient in guiding our legislation through the past year and a half. 
   The expertise which he and his staffers Geoff Gray and Wayne Abernathy brought to the table was absolutely indispensable. Senator GRAMM ensured that this legislation's propound impact on the financial services industry will be a positive one. 
   I also want to acknowledge our Judiciary chairman, Senator HATCH, who I understand will not be participating in the final vote on this legislation tomorrow due to another commitment, but he and his staff likewise worked very closely with us throughout this effort. 
   The support and counsel of Senator WYDEN, my partner in introducing this bipartisan bill last year, has also been essential to bridging the conceptual differences between colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Despite the different approaches we occasionally endorsed, I could always count on his sincere efforts to find common ground on this legislation. Senator WYDEN and his legislative director, Carole Grunberg did yeoman's work on this bill, and for that I wish to express my true appreciation. 
   I also commend Senator PAT LEAHY and his counsel, Julie Katzman for their contributions to this bill. Indeed, we worked hard in putting together the ingredients that made up the Senate version of this legislation, the final amendment which was adopted by the Senate when we passed this last year. Senator LEAHY's continuing interest, involvement, and support were very important to our success. 
   I must also express my gratitude to the Senate leadership for their patience as well as their persistence in moving this legislation. I truly appreciate the assistance of Dave Hoppe, Jack Howard, Jim Sartucci, and Rene Bennett of the Senate Majority Leader's staff. 
   I would also like to give thanks to Massachusetts Governor Paul Cellucci for his assistance and support through the process of drafting this legislation. Massachusetts should be proud of the work done by their Governor and his staff on this bill, especially the Governor's Special Counsel for e-commerce, Daniel Greenwood, to assure that state and federal law governing e-commerce are complimentary. 
   Finally, I would like to recognize the efforts of three members of my own staff who are here tonight. My legislative assistant, Kevin Kolevar, my Judiciary Committee Counsel, Chase Hutto, and my Administrative Assistant Cesar Conda. 
   I thank them for their tireless efforts and loyalty, and recognize they possess both the tremendous vision necessary to conceive of this legislation back in November of 1998, and the dedication to bring it to the point of final passage today. 
   I would just indicate that without these three gentleman and their hard work, numerous impasses that seemed to have doomed this legislation would not have been surmounted. Their willingness to creatively examine the problems we were confronting and come up with new approaches that offered all the participants an opportunity to work together to find a common ground were absolutely indispensable to this success. I certainly can attest to the long hours that were put in by these individuals to make sure that we completed this project and that we are in a position to pass this legislation. 
   As people look back on this effort, and I think they will with a sense that  this was an important achievement, all three of these individuals will be accorded the praise they deserve for their efforts. 
   In closing, let me urge my colleagues to support final passage of the conference report tomorrow morning. I believe that we are passing a very important, landmark piece of legislation that will provide a stimulus to the new economy the likes of which we have not previously seen. I believe it is one of the most important steps we can take as a Congress to remove some of the barriers and impediments that might prevent us from fully enjoying the benefits of the new technologies, and I believe that as it becomes the law of the land, and subsequently as it is used as a basis for the entering into of transactions through e-commerce, we will look back on these achievements with great pride. I am happy to have been part of it. I thank all of my colleagues who made this possible.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on June 16th, 2000, a very dear friend of mine, Mr. Robert Gillette, will celebrate his 60th birthday. I rise today to commemorate this occasion, and to honor a wonderful man who has worked extremely hard to improve living conditions for seniors throughout the State of Michigan. 
   Mr. Gillette is the president of American House, an organization that owns  and operates 24 housing facilities for seniors in the metropolitan Detroit area. American House strives to be the most outstanding affordable senior housing organization in the State of Michigan, and to provide all seniors, regardless of their income, with quality services and care. The organization is founded on the principle that individuals are entitled to living with dignity and with freedom as they enjoy the later years of their lives. 
   Recently, I have had the privilege of working with Mr. Gillette on an issue that is of utmost importance to the seniors of Michigan--affordable senior housing. At certain American House locations, a program has been developed which utilizes two assistance programs available to seniors. A Michigan State Housing Development Authority tax credit provides qualified applicants with a tax credit and rent subsidies, based on income limitations. In addition, the federally funded Medicaid Waiver Program, which has been in effect since the early 1990's assists qualified applicants in paying for housework, meals, and personalized care services in a home environment. 
   Mr. President, taking advantage of these two government subsidy programs has the potential to narrow the gap in housing prospects that exists between low, middle, and high-income seniors. It will provide many seniors, who otherwise would be forced to move into publicly-funded nursing homes, with the ability to remain in assisted living programs like that which American House offers. It is a wonderful program with enormous potential. 
   Combining these programs to assist seniors was the idea of Bob Gillette. This is the kind of work that he does every day. He is always thinking about how to make the lives of people around him better. His enthusiasm for his job and his genuine interest in the people around him make others want to help him. 
   Anyone who knows Bob will tell you that he is a wonderful person. I consider it a privilege to have him as a friend. He is truly a remarkable man. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I wish Bob Gillette a happy 60th birthday, and best of luck in the future.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on June 9, 2000, at the annual State Conference of the Fraternal Order of Police in Lansing, Michigan, there will be a memorial service honoring seventy-four law enforcement officers who have died over the past year, four of whom died in the line of duty. I rise today in their memory, and to thank them posthumously for their many courageous efforts. 
   There is perhaps no greater sign of dedication to a community than risking one's life to protect it. Law enforcement officers do this on a daily basis. They risk their lives to ensure that our streets and our neighborhoods are safe. We must not let ourselves forget the incredible dedication that these men and women have to the people they protect. Theirs should not be a thankless job. 
   Mr. President, the comfort, the protection, and the safety that we enjoy often comes at a very high price to the law enforcement officers themselves. Last year, in the State of Michigan, four officers were killed in the line of duty. In the name of protecting our communities, and our families, they left behind their own communities, and their own families. 
   As a tribute to these four officers, Mr. President, I would like to have their names inserted into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD: 
   Officer Leslie (Les) Keely of the Flint Police Department, Trooper Frederick Hardy, Michigan State Police, Detroit Post, Trooper Rick Lee Johnson, Michigan State Police, Paw Paw Post, Officer Gary Priess, DeWitt Township Police. 
   I do this not only on behalf of myself, but on behalf of all of my constituents, as a symbol of our appreciation and our gratitude for the work that law enforcement officers do every day throughout the State of Michigan. While this is a small gesture, I hope it will hold some meaning to their families and their fellow officers.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in May of 1990, the Second Grace United Methodist Church of Detroit and the First United Methodist Church of Northville collaborated to ``adopt'' a Detroit Public School, Dixon Elementary School. On June 16, 2000, the two churches, one metropolitan and one suburban, will celebrate the tenth anniversary not only of the Adopt-a-School Program, but also of their unique relationship. I rise today to commemorate this occasion. 
   The primary emphasis of the Adopt-a-School Program is the mentoring plan. Adults from both of the churches, as well as the local community, provide tutoring and role modeling for the students. In addition to weekly one-on-one sessions, the mentoring plan also includes a toastmasters club, in which students practice speaking in front of audiences, and a great books program, which introduces students to famous books and authors. 
   In its ten years, the program has experienced continual expansion, as additional activities have been added for the students. There is an awards dinner each year at Second Grace to recognize students who have attained high levels of academic achievement. Christmas and Easter parties are held each year, as well as the Dixon School Spring Cleanup and Flower Planting Day. Church members also participate in school functions, including career day and musical programs. Finally, what began as a summer field trip has evolved into monthly Saturday field trips for the mentors and their pupils. 
   Mr. President, the partners are pleased with how the Adopt-a-School Program has developed in the last ten years. The program has touched the lives of over 300 students at Dixon Elementary School, and there is no measure for success like that. The partners look forward to its continued development in the coming years. In addition, efforts will be made by the two churches, along with Dixon Elementary School, to develop a training program to share the Adopt-a-School program with other faith-based communities interested in serving our children in urban schools. 
   Mr. President, I applaud the efforts of the many people whose hard work over the last ten years has made this birthday celebration possible. Each year, when the partners renew their commitment to this program, it is a testament to the bridges that can be built when people simply reach out to one another. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I would like to wish the Adopt-a-School Program a happy 10th Anniversary, and continued success in the future.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the National Association of Women Business Owners Greater Detroit Chapter, which tonight will celebrate its 20th Anniversary. Since 1980, members of the Greater Detroit Chapter have maintained their commitment not only to helping fellow women business owners throughout Michigan, but also to helping the communities in which these businesses reside. 
   In its twenty years, the Greater Detroit Chapter, originally the Michigan Chapter, has done much to publicize the efforts of women business owners, and to create alliances between women business owners in the State of Michigan. In 1982, chapter members organized the first statewide conference for women business owners, during which awards were given to women business owners in the following categories: Pioneer, Innovator, Dedication to Women Business Owners and Community Service. 
   In bringing women business owners together from throughout the state,  the chapter makes it easier for members to work together on a local level. In 1994, NAWBO North, a networking group of Northern Oakland County members, was formed. In the years since, following the successful model of NAWBO North, satellites have been established in Plymouth, Detroit, Sterling Heights, Brighton, Southfield and Ann Arbor. Involvement in a satellite allows chapter members to work with one another to benefit the community. Currently, 89 percent of chapter members donate money to charities, 76 percent volunteer their time to local organizations, 65 percent serve on local boards, and 61 percent mentor other women. 
   The Greater Detroit Chapter of the NAWBO has also established many programs to assist women owned businesses. In 1990, the Greater Detroit Chapter helped to launch the EXCELI (The Initiative for Entrepreneurial Excellence) Project in Detroit, along with corporate partner Deloitte and Touche, the Small Business Administration, NAWBO's National Foundation and the YWCA. In 1994, the chapter took over sole responsibility of this program. 
   In 1993, Huntington Banks of Michigan entered into a partnership with the chapter to offer market-rate financing to chapter member companies through a special lending process for service businesses. And in June of 1996, Comerica Bank announced its Power Perks Program, in which ideas, resources, and benefits are provided exclusively to NAWBO members. Over the next two years, Comerica invested approximately $10 million in the program. 
   Mr. President, women-owned small businesses are the fastest growing segment of the business community. By the year 2010, they will make up more than one-half of all businesses in the United States. Traveling through the State of Michigan I know that women business owners are working very hard to be successful. The twentieth anniversary of the National Association of Women Business Owners Greater Detroit Chapter is certainly evidence of this. 
   And this incredible growth has been accomplished in spite of some disadvantages. For example, it is clear that the federal government does not do business with a representative percentage of 
   women-owned businesses. This issue was brought to my attention by NAWBO members at a Small Business Committee meeting I held last August in Troy, Michigan. 
   Mr. President, in 1994, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act established a modest five percent goal of federal procurement dollars for women-owned businesses. Last year, though, women-owned businesses received only 2.4 percent of the total dollar value of all prime federal contracts. 
   Mr. President, these standards have to change. There are too many women in this nation working too hard, only to not find the proper support from Washington. Earlier this week, I cosponsored Senate Resolution 311, a resolution urging the President to adopt a policy in support of the five percent federal procurement goal, and to encourage the heads of the federal departments and agencies to undertake a concerted effort to meet this five percent goal before the end of the fiscal year 2000. I strongly hope that this action on my part and the part of my colleagues will lead to an increased procurement for women owned businesses this fiscal year. 
   Mr. President, I applaud the many members of the National Association of Women Business Owners Greater Detroit Chapter on the great work they are doing for women business owners throughout the State of Michigan. I feel that there is much more we can do here in Washington to support them, and I hope that changes will be made, and followed through upon, in this regard. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I wish the greater Detroit Chapter a happy 20th Anniversary, and continued success in the future.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I support the passage of H.R. 4489, the Immigration and Naturalization Service Data Management Improvement Act of 2000, which makes very important revisions to section 110 of the 1996 Immigration Act. I, along with many of my colleagues, introduced an identical Senate companion to this bill, S. 2599, late last week. 
   As originally enacted, section 110 of the 1996 law mandated that an automated system be established to record the entry and exit of all aliens as a means to provide more information on individuals who ``overstay'' their visas. In the opinion of many, it became clear that this well-intentioned measure, if implemented, could have an unforeseen impact. Today, when INS or Customs officials inspect people at land borders, they examine papers as necessary and make quick determinations, using their discretion on when to solicit more information. Section 110, however, was being understood to require revisions to that system that would have greatly complicated travel across the land border by mandating that every single passenger of every single vehicle be required to provide detailed information in a form that could be entered into a computer on the spot. According to Dan Stamper, president of the Detroit International Bridge Company, even assuming an incredibly quick 30 seconds per individual, the traffic delays could exceed 20 hours in numerous jurisdictions at the northern border. This would obviously create extraordinary economic and environmental harm. Moreover, it would divert scarce law enforcement resources away from more effective measures. 
   Out of concern for its harmful impact on Michigan and law enforcement, I passed legislation in 1998 to delay implementation of section 110 from its original start date of September 30, 1998, until March 30, 2001. But it remained clear that a delay could not sufficiently satisfy concerns that the INS might develop a system that would prove harmful to the people of Michigan and other states.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues from the Senate Small Business Committee, Chairman KIT BOND and Ranking Member JOHN KERRY, in support of increased involvement of women-owned small businesses in the Federal procurement process. 
   I have had the opportunity to speak with many women business leaders in Michigan on this matter, and the general opinion is that there are certain doors that are closed to women business owners. In a field hearing I held in Michigan last summer on issues to women in business, I found that many times women business owners face the same problems as men in the private sector. However, when looking at the representation of women in terms of federal procurement dollars, the difference is striking. 
   Six years after posting a modest five-percent goal of Federal procurement dollars for women-owned small businesses, Federal departments and agencies have fallen far short. Last year, only 2.4 percent of the total dollar value of all Federal prime contracts went to women business owners. This shortfall is staggering when taking into account that women-owned small businesses are the fastest growing segment of the business community in the United States. In fact, by the year 2010, women-owned small businesses are expected to make up more than one-half of all businesses in the United States. 
   As a result of this striking information, I introduced an amendment to last year's Women Business Centers Sustainability Act that called for a GAO report studying the trends, barriers and possible solutions to this deficiency. I am proud to report that this report stands to be completed by the end of the year. However, this alone will not provide Federal procurement opportunities for women-owned small businesses. The administration must become actively involved in demanding Federal departments and agencies accomplish the five-percent procurement goal. 
   Mr. President, I have been advocating this issues for quite some time now. My colleagues and I in the Senate Small Business Committee have consistently supported efforts empowering the spirit of entrepreneurship in American women. In my view, these actions must be adopted and enforced on all levels of government. 
   I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me in encouraging the President to hold the heads of the Federal departments and agencies accountable to ensure that the five percent goal is achieved during this fiscal year.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Immigration and Naturalization Service Data Management Improvement Act of 2000. This bill is designed to save jobs in Michigan and other states and prevent potentially enormous, hours-long traffic delays on the U.S.-Canadian border. That is achieved by amending Section 110 of the 1996 immigration law. 
   Mr. President, Section 110 of the 1996 Immigration Act mandated that an automated system be established to record the entry and exit of all aliens as a means to provide more information on individuals who ``over stay''  their visas. In the opinion of many it became clear that this well-intentioned measured, if implemented, could have an unforeseen impact. Today, when INS or Customs officials inspect people at land borders, they examine papers as necessary and make quick determinations, using their discretion on when to solicit more information. According to Dan Stamper, President of the Detroit International Bridge Company, if every single passenger of every single vehicle were required to provide detailed information in a form that could be entered into a computer--even assuming an incredibly quick 30 seconds per individual--the traffic delays could exceed 20 hours in numerous jurisdictions at the Northern border. This would obviously create significant economic and even environmental harm. Moreover, it would divert scarce law enforcement resources away from more effective measures. 
   Out of concern for its harmful impact on Michigan and law enforcement, I passed legislation in 1998 to delay implementation of Section 110 from its original start date of Sept. 30, 1998, until March 30, 2001. But it remained clear that a delay could not sufficiently satisfy concerns that the INS might develop a system that would prove harmful to the people of Michigan and other states. 
   Mr. President, FRED UPTON showed great leadership in the House on this issue and served his constituents extraordinarily well in helping to forge this compromise. LAMAR SMITH deserves great credit for working closely with us and his other House colleagues in making an agreement that meets the economic and security interests of all sides on this issue. 
   This is a great victory for the people of Michigan. This agreement strikes the right balance in enhancing our security and immigration enforcement needs while ensuring that we preserve the jobs and the other economic benefits Michigan receives from our close relationship with Canada. 
   This bill, the product of the agreement with the House, replaces the current requirement that by March 30, 2001, a record of arrival and departure be collected for every alien at all ports of entry with a more achievable requirement that the Immigration and Naturalization Service develop an ``integrated entry and exit data system'' that focuses on data INS already regularly collects at ports of entry. 
   The goal of Section 110 has been to track individuals who overstay their allowable stay in the United States. That goal is redirected into a more achievable direction. INS will be directed to put in electronic and retrievable form the information already collected at ports of entry and pursue other measures steps to improve enforcement of U.S. immigration laws. In addition, a task force chaired by the Attorney General that will include representatives of other government agencies and the private sector is established to examine the need for and costs of any additional measures, including additional security measures, at our borders. The bill also calls for increased 
   international cooperation in securing the land borders. 
   In essence, the agreement substitutes this approach in place of a mandate that a system be developed that would have required that all foreign travelers or U.S. permanent residents be individually recorded into a system at ports of entry and exit, thereby likely bringing traffic to a halt on the northern border for miles, trapping U.S. travelers in the process and costing potentially tens of thousands of jobs in manufacturing, tourism and other industries. The agreement also maintains the status quo in preventing new documentary requirements on Canadian travelers. 
   Mr. President, the bottom line is that we will have a system that enhances law enforcement capabilities and will not impose new or onerous requirements on travelers that would damage Americans or the American economy. 
   I would like to thank the cosponsors of this legislation who have been so important in achieving success in this long three-year effort: Senators LEAHY, GRAMS, KENNEDY, SNOWE, COLLINS, CRAIG, GORTON, JEFFORDS, SCHUMER, GRAHAM, LEVIN, DEWINE, and MURRAY.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize WLNS-TV in Lansing, Michigan, a station which will celebrate its 50th Anniversary on May 18, 2000. For fifty years, Channel 6 has provided Lansing residents with a wonderful mix of local and national news, community events and information, and an assortment of entertaining and insightful programming. 
   On May 1, 1950, WJIM-TV, Channel 6, signed on the air in Lansing, Michigan. The station was founded by Mr. Harold Gross, and for the next forty-four years he owned WJIM-TV. In 1984, Bakke Communications bought WJIM-TV, and changed the call letters to WLNS-TV. In 1986, the station's current owners, Young Broadcasting of Lansing, Inc., purchased WLNS-TV. 
   Serving the Lansing community has always been, and remains, the first and foremost priority of WLNS-TV. Channel 6 covers 24 hours of local news per week. It broadcasts Town Hall meetings on important community issues; political debates; major high school and college sporting events; severe weather and school closing information; and regular announcements highlighting important activities for hundreds of non-profit organizations in the community. 
   As a C.B.S. affiliate, WLNS-TV is able to keep Lansing residents abreast of local as well as national and global events. In addition, Channel 6 offers C.B.S. entertainment programs and national sporting events. For instance, when the Michigan State University Men's Basketball Team won the N.C.A.A. Championship this past season, Lansing viewers turned to WLNS-TV not only to watch the games, but also to get local updates on their favorite team and its players. 
   Mr. President, Channel 6 has been home to many prominent Lansing personalities over the years, including Martha Dixon, hostess of the cooking show ``The Copper Kettle''; Len Stuttman, host of ``The Many Worlds of Len Stuttman''; Bill Dansby, news anchor and news director in the 1960's; Howard Lancour, host of the children's show ``Alley Cat and the Mayor,'' and a news anchor in the 1970's; and Jane Aldrich and Sheri Jones, current news anchors who have 25 years of combined tenure at WLNS-TV. 
   Mr. President, I applaud the many people whose efforts over the years have made this birthday possible. I think it is safe to say that the long term success of WLNS-TV is representative of how much Channel 6, and its many employees, mean to the Lansing community. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I would like to wish WLNS-TV in Lansing, Michigan, a happy 50th Anniversary.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Ms. Janet Huvaere, who is retiring this spring after 39 years of teaching at St. Jude School in Northeast Detroit. During her time at St. Jude, Ms. Huvaere has constantly been a light in the lives of her students and her fellow staff members, and her dedication to them and to her profession has truly been remarkable. 
   Ms. Huvaere was born in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, on October 11, 1938. She attended St. Ambrose School for both grade school and high school. After graduating from St. Ambrose, Ms. Huvaere worked for a year at Bon Secours Hospital, and then entered the Adrian Dominican Order. After two years, she left to attend Siena Heights University in Adrian, Michigan. She began teaching at St. Jude upon receiving her bachelor's degree from Siena Heights in 1961. 
   In her 39 years at St. Jude School, Ms. Huvaere has taught the third, fifth and sixth grades. Her dedication to her students is surpassed only by her dedication and love for her family. One of her greatest memories came in 1986, when her father, who was ill at the time, was able to partake in a celebration marking her 25th year at St. Jude. 
   Mr. President, Ms. Huvaere has touched many lives during her thirty-nine years of teaching, and has been a role model to many children in the State of Michigan. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Ms. Huvaere on a wonderful career, and wish her the best of luck in retirement.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on May 19, 2000, the Barry County Parks and Recreation Commission will unveil a brand new exhibition at Historic Charlton Park Village, Museum and Recreation Area in Hastings, Michigan. The exhibition is entitled ``A Test of a Nation: The Honor of a County,'' and is a tribute to the soldiers that Barry County sent off to battle during the Civil War, and also to their families. I rise today, Mr. President, in honor of this special occasion. 
   During the Civil War, Barry County, at the time populated by less than 15,000 people, contributed 1,632 men to the Union Army, the highest percentage of citizens per county in the State of Michigan. The new exhibition illustrates what life was like for these men out in the field, and for their loved ones at home. Part of the grand opening celebration on May 19, 2000, will be educational programs on the topic of the Civil War. 
   The exhibition was made possible in part by funds from a Michigan Arts, Cultural and Quality of Life Grant. On September 1, 1999, Historic Charlton Park received $339,000 to remodel and expand the museum. ``A Test of a Nation: The Honor of a County'' marks the completion of the first phase of the project. 
   Mr. President, it goes without saying that the Civil War is one of the most important events in American History, and perhaps the most important. I applaud all of the people whose efforts made this exhibition possible, for with these efforts they have allowed individuals of all ages an opportunity to experience a little part of that history. They have given them a chance to see what life was like for the men, women and children of Barry County who played an important role in keeping our nation together. 
   On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Historic Charlton Park Village on the opening of ``A Test of a Nation: The Honor of a County.'' It is truly an important exhibition, and I know that the people of Barry County will greatly appreciate it.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on May 18, 2000, The Friends of Theodore Roethke, a group dedicated to maintaining the legacy of the great poet, will unveil a historic marker in his honor on the lawn of his childhood home at 1805 Gratiot, Saginaw, Michigan. I rise today, Mr. President, in honor of this special occasion. 
   Mr. Roethke was born in Saginaw in 1908, the son of Otto and Helen Huebner Roethke. He attended the University of Michigan and Harvard Graduate School, and later was a professor at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania, Michigan State University, Penn State University, Bennington College in Vermont, and the University of Washington in Seattle. 
   Before his death on August 1, 1963, Mr. Roethke received many awards for his poetry. In 1954, he became the first Michigan man to win the Pulitzer Prize for his collection of poems entitled The Waking. And in 1959, he received the Bollingen Prize and a National Book Award for another collection of poems entitled Words of the Wind. Some of his other works include The Lost Son, Praise to the End!, and I Am! Says the Lamb. 
   In 1998, the Friends of Theodore Roethke purchased both Roethke homes in Saginaw, Michigan, with a mission to promote, preserve and protect the literary legacy of the great poet by restoring his family residences for cultural and educational opportunities. Since the group purchased the homes, they have written grants for educational writing workshops combining Saginaw public and Saginaw Township students, offered tours for students and teachers, purchased some of the original Roethke furnishing, opened the houses to working writers, and made some much needed repairs, such as a new furnace and asbestos removal. 
   Mr. President, I applaud The Friends of Theodore Roethke for their wonderful efforts to keep alive the legacy of Michigan's only Pulitzer Prize winning poet. I am sure that the unveiling of this historic marker is only the first of many tributes. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate The Friends of Theodore Roethke on the dedication of this historic marker, and wish President Annie Ransford and the rest of the organization continued success in the future.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in honor and in memory of Ms. Mary S. Palmeri, who passed away on August 30, 1999. Ms. Palmeri served the County of Wayne, Michigan, for 32 years, and has been chosen by her peers to posthumously receive the coveted Court Clerk of the Year Award, which will be presented to her family this week. 
   Ms. Palmeri was born in St. Mary's Hospital in Detroit in 1939, and was a lifelong resident of the city of Dearborn, Michigan. She graduated from Fordson High School in 1958, and spent approximately two years in college. In June of 1967, Ms. Palmeri became a typist at the County of Wayne Department of Civil Service, thus beginning a thirty-two year career of public service. 
   A few years later Ms. Palmeri was transferred to the County Clerk's Office, where she worked in numerous offices prior to becoming a Court Clerk, including the Record Room and as Supervisor of the Appeals Department. Ms. Palmeri ultimately worked as a Court Clerk for many prominent judges, including the Honorable Henry J. Szymanski, the Honorable William J. Cahalan, and the Honorable Pamela R. Harwood. 
   In addition to her work, Ms. Palmeri enjoyed many hobbies, including bowling, ceramics, crocheting, knitting and crewel embroidery. She was both a terrfic seamstress and a wonderful cook. She also loved to play cards, work on crossword puzzles, and play board games. She was also an active member of St. Alphonseus Catholic Church in Dearborn, Michigan. Ms. Palmeri is survived by her husband of thirty years, Frank, and their three children, Christopher, Cindy and John. 
   Mr. President, I am glad that the County of Wayne has chosen to honor Ms. Palmeri's many years of service by presenting her family with the Court Clerk of the Year Award. She was a hard worker who truly cared for the people around her, and her warm and generous personality is deeply missed by the entire Dearborn community.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, each year, the Attorney Division of State of Israel Bonds honors two individuals with the Eleanor Roosevelt Humanities Award. Recipients of this award are recognized for their contributions to the legal profession as well as their outstanding service to humanity in the spirit and ideals of Mrs. Roosevelt. I rise today to recognize the Honorable Barry M. Grant and the Honorable Nanci J. Grant, who will both receive the Eleanor Roosevelt Humanities Award on May 16, 2000, in Southfield, Michigan. 
   The Honorable Nanci J. Grant is the Presiding Judge of General Jurisdiction for the Oakland County Circuit Court. She was elected to this position in November of 1996 and took office on January 1, 1997. Judge Grant is a graduate of the University of Michigan and Wayne State University Law School. Prior to joining the bench, she was a trial attorney with the law firm of Dickinson, Wright, Moon, VanDusen & Freeman, and served as a researcher, Friend of the Court intern, arbitrator and mediator for the Oakland County Circuit Court. 
   Judge Grant is a member of the Executive Committee of the Michigan Judges Association, and co-chairs the Rules Committee. By gubernatorial appointment, Judge Grant represents all Michigan circuit court judges on the State Community Corrections Board. She is an advisory board member of the Michigan Judicial Institute, the teaching arm of the Michigan Supreme Court. Judge Grant is also a member of the National Association of Women Judges, the American Bar Association, the Oakland County Bar Association, the Women's Bar Association, American Judges Association, and the University of Michigan Alumni Association. 
   In addition, Judge Grant has dedicated much of her time to the improvement of the Oakland County Community. She is a member of the Michigan Cancer Foundation, and has served as a member of Common Ground Advisory Board, the Rotary Club of Birmingham, and Bloomfield Youth Assistance. She is a board member of the Women's Survival Center, and a Director of the Women's Officials Network. She also has served on the Partners Executive Committee, and was a member of the Citizens Alliance of the Probate Court, where she served as chairperson of the Information and Advocacy Committee. 
   Judge Grant has often been awarded for her many endeavors, both charitable and professional. The monthly magazine, Hour Detroit, named her as one of the new leaders in the Detroit metropolitan area. She was selected by Crain's Detroit Business magazine as one the ``40 under 40,'' a select group of forty of Metro Detroit's best and brightest residents under the age of forty. In addition, Judge Grant has been elected as an ``Outstanding Young Woman of America.'' 
   Mr. President, I applaud the Honorable Nanci M. Grant on her many achievements, both within the realm of the law and outside of that realm. I am sure that the Eleanor Roosevelt Humanities Award will hold a special place among her many recognitions. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Judge Grant on receiving this award, and wish her continued success in the future.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of the Salvation Army in Benton Harbor, Michigan, which on May 20-21, 2000, will celebrate its 75th Anniversary. This event will conclude a very special week for the organization, as May 15-21, 2000, is also National Salvation Army Week, during which Americans have the opportunity to salute an organization that does so many things for so many people around the world. 
   Mr. President, the mission of the movement remains the same as it was in 1865, when William and Catherine Booth formed an evangical group, and preached to people living in poverty on the east side of London: to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ and to meet human needs in His name without discrimination. The organization, officially titled the Salvation Army in 1878, and its many adherents, soldiers, officers, and volunteers, remain dedicated to caring for the poor, feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, loving the unlovable, and befriending those who have no friends. 
   In its 135 years, the Salvation Army has expanded from this small coalition of individuals in London into a multi-faceted, global organization. Its outreach currently extends to over 100 countries, and the Gospel is preached by its officers and soldiers in 160 languages. Each year, the organization assists over 27 million individuals. In the United States alone, there are 1.7 million volunteers, 470,000 Salvationists, 5,339 officers, and 43,000 employees serving the Salvation Army. 
   Amid such statistics I fear it is easy to overlook the essential fact that the foundation of the Salvation Army lies at the community level. It is an organization based in communities, whose volunteers, officers and employees are primarily concerned with helping members of their own community in the name of Jesus Christ. Whether it be through summer camps, day care centers, services for senior citizens, shelters for battered wives and children, drug rehabilitation, or family and career counseling, where there is a Salvation Army, there are people working hard to improve their community. 
   With this in mind, Mr. President, I applaud the officers, Salvationists, volunteers and employees of the Salvation Army in Benton Harbor, whose efforts over the years have had made this anniversary possible. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I wish the Salvation Army in Benton Harbor a happy 75th birthday, and continued success in the future.

I rise today to recognize the Honorable Barry M. Grant and the Honorable Nanci J. Grant, who will both receive the Eleanor Roosevelt Humanities Award on May 16, 2000, in Southfield, Michigan. 
   The Honorable Barry M. Grant has been an Oakland County Probate Judge since 1977, currently serving as the Chief Judge Pro Tem for the county's probate court. He received his graduate degree from Michigan State University and his law degree from Wayne State University, with postgraduate work at Northwestern University and Harvard Law School. Prior to becoming a Judge, he was a practicing attorney, having started his career as a clerk in the Probate Court and later serving as Assistant Prosecuting Attorney. 
   Judge Grant is President of the National College of Probate Judges and Editor of their national publication. He serves as the Secretary of the Judicial Tenure Commission and was the Chairman of that organization in 1992 and 1993. He has served as Secretary, Treasurer and President of the Michigan Judges Association and was President of the Oakland County Judges Association. Judge Grant has been on several gubernatorial commissions including the Governor's Traffic Safety Commission and the Strategic Planning Commission for programs for the mentally ill. In addition, Judge Grant authors a weekly column in The Detroit News, helping to keep many Michigan residents abreast of current issues involving the law. 
   In addition, Judge Grant dedicates much of his time to the Oakland County Community. He has served as Treasurer of the Southfield Board of Education, was a member of the Parent Youth Guidance Commission, is on the Board of Trustees of William Beaumont Hospital, and is a Director of the Boys Scouts of America, Clinton Valley Council. He has served as a Director of the Oakland County Chapters of the American Cancer Association, the Michigan Cancer Foundation and the March of Dimes.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Anthony Wayne Elementary School in Detroit, Michigan, which on May 12, 2000, will officially celebrate its 70th Anniversary. Events have been scheduled throughout this week, providing administrators, teachers, students and parents an opportunity to reflect upon the history of their elementary school, and at the same time witness how far it has come in seventy years. 
   The roots of Wayne Elementary School lie in a two room portable building near the heart of Detroit, where Mrs. Jessie Baum and Ms. Etta Coetzer, under the guidance of Principal Ms. Florence Kessler, began teaching kindergarten through fifth grade students in March of 1928. Their efforts led to the construction of a six-room building at 10633 Courville Street in February of 1930, officially marking the birth of Wayne Elementary School. 
   Though the face and shape of the building have been forced to change often to accomodate a growing number of students, the teachers and administrators of Wayne Elementary School  still instill the same values into their students as did Ms. Kessler, Mrs. Coetzer, and Mrs. Baum: learning two different sets of three R's, not only the traditional writing, reading, and arithmetic, but also rights, responsibility, and respect. 
   To this end, Wayne Elementary School encourages parents and other members of the community to become involved with the education of their children. In 1998, working in cooperation with the Greening of Detroit and the Ford Motor company volunteers, the children planted trees, bushes and wild flowers during the month of May. The habitat area now serves as an outdoor classroom and each spring the students intend to plant more trees, bushes and flowers. 
   Two other important programs have recently been developed at Wayne Elementary School. Academic Games, started by Ms. Nicole Stewart, encourages learning achievement while at the same time demonstrating to students that learning can indeed be fun. And in 1995, two chess teams were formed by Mr. Carter and Mr. Cook, a primary team (K-3) and an upper elementary team of fourth and fifth graders. On May 11, these teams will send ten students to Dallas, Texas, to compete against the nation's best elementary school chess players. I would like to wish them the best of luck in that competition. 
   Mr. President, I applaud all of the teachers, parents, students and administrators whose hard work over the years has made this anniversary possible. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I wish Anthony Wayne Elementary School a happy 70th birthday, and continued success in the coming years.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, title II of the bill before the Senate today includes a provision called the Teacher Employment Act--or TEA. This provision combines the current ESEA, title II, Eisenhower Professional Development Program and the class-size reduction program, for a total of $2 billion, which is then made available to states and local education agencies for teacher development programs. 
   Our amendment would amend the TEA provision--and expand the scope of allowable uses of title II professional development funds to allow states and local education agencies to use these funds for the development and implementation of teacher testing, merit-based pay, and tenure reform programs. 
   Mr. President, I believe that a qualified, highly trained, and highly motivated teacher is the key to a quality education for America's children. Most of our colleagues would agree. 
   Teachers play a special and indispensable role in our children's education. Nothing can replace the positive and long-lasting impact a dedicated, knowledgeable teacher has on a child's learning process. 
   The National Commission on Teaching and America's Future found that while class size reduction has the least impact on increasing student achievement and that teacher-education--teacher quality--has the most impact on student achievement. 
   Our amendment is designed to improve the quality of our teachers. It puts into practice the common sense we all share--the sense that teachers should be trained in the area they teach, that outstanding teachers should be rewarded, and that a teacher's promotion should be based not just on longevity but on performance. 
   Let me explain why I believe this amendment is important. First, I believe that teachers should know the subject matter they teach. Unfortunately, this is not always the case in many classrooms around the country. According to the Department of Education, one-third of high school math teachers, nearly 25 percent of high school English teachers and 20 percent of science teachers, are teaching without a college major or minor in their subjects. Teacher testing allows school districts to better target those teachers in need of additional professional development. By pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses of teachers, schools will be able to place teachers in their area of specialty and help those teachers in need of additional professional development. 
   A recent study, using student math scores on the Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program for two large Tennessee metropolitan area school systems, at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville ranked teachers based on five objective rankings of effectiveness. By the fifth grade, students who had studied under ``highly ineffective'' teachers averaged 54 to 60 points lower on achievement tests than students who had spent the 3 years with ``highly effective'' teachers. 
   I believe that States and local districts should be allowed to use Federal funds for teacher testing programs to determine which teachers are effective, 
   and for which teachers additional professional development would be of assistance. 
   Second, I believe that outstanding teachers should be rewarded with merit-based pay increases. Teachers who motivate and inspire their students and put forth the extra effort to improve and expand their own skills should be rewarded. In the business world, employees who go the extra mile and exceed expectations are financially rewarded for their dedication and hard work. Are teachers, tasked with educating and shaping our children lives and futures, any less deserving of merit-based pay rewards? 
   Merit-based pay would reward teachers for exceptional teaching--providing added incentive to excel at a demanding and challenging profession. A senior associate at the Educational Trust, an advocacy group for the poor, once referred to high-poverty schools as boot camps for teachers. 
   Shouldn't there be the option of rewarding teachers who choose to take the more difficult path or who inspire less advantaged students to perform at a level well above that of their peers? I believe every one of us understands that teachers do, indeed, deserve these rewards. And, what is more, our kids deserve the improved educational experience such rewards will produce. Finally, I believe that teachers should be promoted to higher positions based on performance and subject expertise, not just on the longevity of their tenure. 
   Tenure reform ensures teachers will be held accountable for their overall performance in the classroom. According to U.S. News and World Report, the presiding officer's own State of Kentucky's tenure reforms--which includes exhaustive performance evaluations of teachers and schools and accountability for poorly performing teachers and administrators--have dramatically improved many of that State's worst performing schools. All of these reforms can vastly improve the quality of instruction in the classroom, which will provide students with the educational tools necessary to succeed in this new demanding economy they confront. I believe we ought to permit the States and local districts to use federal funds to design, develop, and implement these reforms--should they decide to do so. 
   Now let me now explain what this amendment does and does not do. It permits--and I stress word ``permits''--states and localities to use these funds for teacher testing, merit pay, or tenure reform programs. It does not mandate or require them to set up these programs--nor does it penalize them if they choose not to. It gives States and localities the freedom to decide precisely how these programs should be designed and how they should be administered. It does not require the States and local districts to do anything with the information gathered from testing or which tests to be used. Nor would they be required to base merit pay decisions on the outcome of the teacher tests. This amendment does not dictate that Federal funds must be used for tenure reform or establish criteria for such reform. Again, it only permits States and local districts to use funds for those purposes if they choose, based on how they choose. 
   While it could be argued that teacher testing, tenure reform, and merit-pay programs are already permissible uses under the Teachers Empowerment Act provision, we believe that explicitly listing these programs would eliminate any uncertainty among the states and local districts, granting them the freedom to full develop and implement the programs which will best target their specific needs in teacher professional development. This amendment is based in the same principles as the legislation that passed the Senate last Congress with bipartisan support by a vote of 63-35. 
   In conclusion, I would like to recognize a very simple fact. We in Washington too often focus on these issues from simply a national perspective. I think this debate we have had over the last few days clearly focuses on the important, critical role States and especially local school districts must play in the development of quality education in our Nation. 
   This amendment is designed to give even more flexibility to the States and the local districts to use these Federal funds for programs that we believe can help to improve their quality. There are no mandates. This is simply a permissible use that we would be providing. 
   In summary, we think this legislation can be improved by the amendment. We look forward to hearing discussion on it today. We believe it is important to reward quality teachers of this country for their commitment to ensure our children will be taught by the most qualified and knowledgeable individuals available. 
   I will have more to say on this as we go forward. I know there are other Senators wishing to address the issue. I note the presence of Senators MACK, WELLSTONE, and KENNEDY, so I yield the floor and I will speak again at a later point.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. My understanding is States have experimented with merit pay programs since the 1960s. I can recall in the late 1960s when I was an intern working in the education office of the Governor of Michigan, we were looking at various experimental programs, learning from models from places such as North Carolina and other States that were experimenting with those programs. 
   It seems to me this is not a new proposal at all. It is one with which various States have experimented and employed in different ways for a long time. That was my first experience with it, I think in 1969, 1970.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will speak about my amendment and the second-degree amendment to it which I did not address earlier. 
   The amendment Senator MACK and I have offered today essentially allows title II funds to be used for three purposes not specified in the underlying bill: First, for teacher testing programs, to ensure that teachers teaching our kids have the skills and knowledge about the subject matter they are teaching; second, for merit pay programs that could identify and reward teachers who perform exceptionally; third, tenure reform programs that shift the focus on teacher advancement and promotion to a broader subject of categories beyond mere longevity. 
   We believe these will make a difference in terms of improving the quality of teaching. As I speak to parents in my State, there is no question they want teachers conversant with the subject matter they are teaching their kids. They want to reward and acknowledge exceptional teachers and make sure the process employed with respect to the schools and their communities is based on ability and merit. 
   We were criticized during the debate on only one of these, the merit pay proposal. That was the extent of the criticism leveled at this amendment earlier today. There then was a second-degree amendment offered. Interestingly, the second-degree amendment wiped away the two areas that were not subjected to any criticism--the teacher testing and the tenure reform proposals--in their entirety. It then replaced our merit proposal with a different one, one that rewards all teachers in schools that showed an increase in achievement by students. 
   Interestingly, I find it odd that the two areas that were not criticized earlier were eliminated from the secondary amendment, and I question the approach taken in the second amendment with respect to merit pay programs. 
   Our approach is a permissive approach we are offering as an option for the possible use of title II funds. No school will be mandated to do this. No school will be forced to do it. Under no circumstance will the Federal Government outline, identify, design, or in any way dictate the types of programs that would be used. 
   In the second-degree amendment, however, only one type of program of merit pay is proposed, and it has an odd component to it. It says all teachers in any school that shows certain types of improvement, to be a presumably later identified, would benefit from enhanced salaries or bonuses. 
   That means the worst teacher, in a school that showed overall achievement, would receive some sort of merit award. Meanwhile, the very best teacher who might be producing tremendous increases in achievement among his or her students in another school would not qualify. I see an inconsistency. I also question why the two sections of our amendment that were not criticized or even commented on earlier today have been entirely eliminated by the second-degree amendment. 
   The choice is simple. Our approach permits districts and State education agencies to use title II funds for programs they would design with respect to teacher testing, merit pay, and tenure reform. I believe that is a wise course to follow if our goal is to increase the quality of the teaching of our children in America today. I sincerely hope our colleagues will choose to follow that course by rejecting the second-degree amendment and supporting the Abraham-Mack proposal.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in response, I don't know how anyone can say that a program proven to work is one that rewards the worst teacher in a school that may, in fact, be producing a decrease in the achievement level of their students. I don't think that could possibly be argued to be an effective way to use Federal dollars. Yet that is what would happen under the proposed second-degree amendment. 
   Our amendment, on the other hand, opens the way for school districts and State education agencies to use these funds in the most effective way they deem possible to improve the quality of teaching. I look forward to the vote on this. 
   I thank Senator KENNEDY for his debate today.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dr. Richard J. Halik, who is retiring after 34 years of dedicated service to the Lansing, Michigan, School District. A graduate of Eastern High School in Lansing himself, Dr. Halik has enjoyed a successful career as a student, teacher, and administrator in the Lansing School District, and his efforts as Superintendent have played a large role in bringing the Lansing Public School system into the new millennium on a successful note. 
   After receiving his Bachelor of Arts Degree from Western Michigan University in 1966, Dr. Halik took a position as a seventh grade science teacher at Otto Middle School. In 1970, he was named Supervisor of federally funded Title I programs operating in the district at the time, and in 1972 he became Director of Federal and State Programs for the Lansing School System. After serving as Principal of Gardner Junior High School in 1979-80, Dr. Halik was promoted to the position of Elementary Education Director in 1981, and the following year became Assistant Superintendent for Instruction. On July 1, 1985, he was named Superintendent of the Lansing School District, and he has held this post ever since. 
   Dr. Halik has been an active member of the Lansing community his entire life. He currently serves as Vice Chair of the Sparrow Health System Board of Directors, and as Vice President of the Hinman Endowment Fund Board of Directors. In addition, he sits on the Board of Directors of several other local organizations, including the Greater Lansing Area Advisory Council, the Lansing Area Safety Council, the Estes Palmer Foundation, the Urban Education Alliance, and Junior Achievement. He is also on the Advisory Board of the Lansing Area Safety Council, the Corporate Board of the Boys and Girls Club of Lansing, and is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Lansing Educational Advancement Foundation. 
   Dr. Halik is a member of Mt. Hope Presbyterian Church and the Lansing Host Lions Club, and has served as President of the latter group. He has also served as President of the Middle Cities Education Association and the Lansing Association of School Administrators. In 1978, he represented the State of Michigan at the National Institute of Education as advisor on the relationship of the Michigan Compensatory Education Program to ESEA Title I, and in 1993 he was a recipient of the National Leadership Award from the Institute for Education Leadership. 
   Dr. Halik's contributions to the Lansing School District, and to Michigan's education community in general, are truly immeasurable. I would like to thank him for his dedication and many efforts over the last thirty-four years. His leadership during this time has been exceptional and will be dearly missed. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Dr. Richard J. Halik on a wonderful and successful career, and wish him the best of luck in retirement.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, next Monday, May 1, 2000, is the first day of the first National Charter Schools Week in our nation's history, an event modeled after similar state level celebrations in Michigan and California. I feel that this is a momentous occasion which provides the nation with an opportunity to acknowledge and celebrate the hard work and many accomplishments of charter school teachers, students, parents, administrators, and board members. Charter schools are a relatively recent phenomenon, but they have already established their mark on our nation's public education system. 
   Mr. President, I am extremely proud of the role the State of Michigan has played in the development of charter schools. Since 1993, when Michigan became the ninth state to grant citizens the freedom to establish charter schools, 173 public school academies, as they are called, have been founded. This places Michigan third in the nation in number of charter schools, behind just Arizona and California. In the fall of 1999, over 50,000 students attended these public school academies, up from 30,000 in 1998. More importantly, 91 percent of Michigan parents said their charter public school did a better job of educating their child, and eight of ten said charter schools are better at motivating students. 
   It is my feeling that these numbers are an indication of the many benefits charter public schools offer to communities. They provide parents and students with choice in education. They allow teachers a degree of flexibility that cannot be found in traditional public schools. Furthermore, they allow administrators and board members a certain amount of innovation in the founding, and also the funding, of schools, and in the decisions that are made in how they are to be run. 
   Mr. President, what charter schools do, first and foremost, is give teachers, students, parents, and administrators the ability to experiment, to tinker with the system in the hopes of improving it, and they do this while at the same time remaining accountable to local and state school boards. If our educational system is to improve, if we are truly going to strive to provide our nation's children with the education they deserve, I feel that charter schools are going to play a vital role in this process. 
   Indeed, Mr. President, in charter schools, we have a situation where everybody wins. Parents are able to send their children to a safe school environment where they will have more say in the entire process. Teachers are able to find new ways to do their own work, to work together with one another, and to work with members of the community. Administrators are lifted from many of the restraints of the traditional public school system. And the greatest benefactor of all this will be our nation's public school students. They are the ones who will benefit from the competition, the experimentation, and the innovation, because of the effect that these things will have on our entire public education system. 
   Mr. President, I have long been a supporter of charter schools and the many opportunities they offer. It was my pleasure last year to have secured $925,000 in funding for Central Michigan University, which will use this money to establish a national Charter Schools Development and Performance Institute. The grand opening of the institute is May 1, 2000, which also happens to be Michigan's Third Annual Charter School Day. The goal of the institute is to foster high-performing students and effectively run charter public schools by promoting development, achievement, and accountability. It will also disseminate information on and assist schools with the design and the implementation of charter school models. 
   Mr. President, I am extremely excited that the week of May 1-May 5, 2000, is being officially recognized as National Charter Schools Week. I am hopeful that this will help to make our nation more aware of charter schools, and the wonderful opportunities they offer to teachers, parents, and students throughout our nation. The sooner we fully realize the potential of charter schools, the sooner they will be able to fully reach this potential.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of the City of Grand Rapids, Michigan, which on May 1, 2000, will celebrate its 150th birthday. Residents of the city have been invited to commemorate the occasion with Mayor John Logie at the Grand Rapids Sesquicentennial Community Party, an event which will highlight the growth and development of a city that is still on the ascent. 
   When a group of fur trappers, explorers, loggers, and sod busters took a break from their daily activities on May 1, 1850, to make Grand Rapids an incorporated city, the estimated population was 2,686 persons. The number of square miles that the city encompassed stood at four, the estimated number of city officials was sixteen, there were thirty two miles of road within city limits, and there was neither a police force nor a fire department. To be sure, the first mayor of Grand Rapids, Mr. Henry R. Williams, had his work cut out for him. 
   Today, I think Mr. Williams would be extremely proud to see how far the city of Grand Rapids has come in its 150 years. Its population now stands at 192,000 persons, and, when surrounding metropolitan areas are added to this, the figure grows to 1,021,200. This makes Grand Rapids the second largest city in Michigan and the 58th largest city in the Nation. The city encompasses 45 square miles, employs over 2,000 city officials, has 562.81 miles of road within its limits, a police force of 379 officers and a fire department of 260 firefighters. Mr. President, I think it goes without saying that Mayor Logie also has a lot of work on his hands. 
   The City of Grand Rapids has planned many events to be included as part of its Sesquicentennial Celebration. All elementary schools, public, private, and charter, will be served birthday cake on May 1. The original city boundary will be marked with special historic 1850 signs. City officials have commissioned the designing of a parade float to participate in area parades, which depicts the Grand River and is fully equipped with jumping fish, fireworks, and depictions of historic buildings and neighborhoods. Free coloring books entitled ``The City of Grand Rapids: Then and Now,'' will be distributed on April 29, 2000. 
   In addition, officials from the four sister cities of Grand Rapids--Omihachiman, Japan; Bielsko-Biala, Poland; Perugia, Italy; and Ga District, Ghana--will join in the celebration. A time capsule, to be built into the new Archive Center, will receive its first items. One hundred and fifty trees will be planted throughout the community to commemorate the birthday celebration. A beginning list of 150 historical sites in Grand Rapids will be released on April 29, 2000, and will be completed throughout the year. And finally, the Grand Rapids Press will publish four essays, submitted by Grand Rapids residents, as a tribute to the birthday, with the topics of these essays ranging from diversity to the city's quality of life. 
   Mr. President, in one hundred and fifty years, residents of Grand Rapids have experienced their fair share of both prosperity and decline. At the end of World War II, the future of Grand Rapids looked bleak. Through the incredible efforts of thousands of individuals in the years since, though, the city has managed to turn the tables full tilt. As we enter the new millennium, Grand Rapids is enjoying the greatest economic boom in its history. With this economic prosperity has come a remarkable turn in the overall quality of life that residents enjoy. Also, it should be noted that Grand Rapids is one of Michigan's most diverse cities, diversity which increases everyday as more and more jobs are created within city limits. The turnaround of Grand Rapids serves as a model, and an inspiration, to other cities, not only in Michigan, but throughout the Nation. 
   Mr. President, I extend greetings to all those participating in the Grand Rapids Sesquicentennial Community Party, and the many other events that have been planned for the celebration of the anniversary. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I wish the City of Grand Rapids a happy 150th birthday.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 85th anniversary of the 1915 Genocide of the Armenians by the Turkish Government. As so many of you are aware, between 1915 and 1923 more than one and a half million Armenians perished from atrocities committed against them. Yet the brave Armenian people persevered. 
   As the grandson of Lebanese immigrants, I am, of course, very familiar with the historic ties that have bound Armenians to the Lebanese. We have sheltered and strengthened one another in time of need. As peoples we have become close because the experience of being forced from one's home and homeland is not new to either of us. 
   Through mass deportations, starvation, disease, and outright massacres, Armenians have carried their heads high, as they carried on their way of life or carried their culture to new lands. The strength and pride in Armenian heritage have kept alive the memory of those who perished in the genocide. I rise today to pay tribute to that strong, proud heritage. 
   As a constant symbol of the strength and perseverance through which oppressed peoples survive, the Armenian genocide must serve as a reminder that we must never forget the atrocities of the past, lest they be repeated. 
   The Senate Immigration Subcommittee, which I chair, recently held hearings on the status of Albanian refugees in Kosovo. I must say that I was impressed with the strength and faith of these people in the face of the great hardships visited on their people. And I was reminded of another people ``cleansed'' from its homeland by brutal invaders. 
   But too few Americans are in a position to make that comparison. In the 85 years since the massacre of Armenians began, another great crime has been committed--the crime of keeping the truth from the world. 
   This was a crime against all people, because it denied them the lessons to be learned from that tragic tale. But most of all it was a crime against all Armenians, alive and dead. For even the dead have at least one right--that of having their story told. 
   The 1.5 million Armenians who died deserve to have the truth of their suffering known. Only when we know the horror that they went through can we comprehend the gravity of the crime. Only then will the rights of the dead be fulfilled. This is why we must make sure younger generations understand what happened and ensure that it never happens again. 
   Eighty-four years ago the world had the opportunity to prevent the Armenian holocaust. But the world did not act. While there was much talk, there was no real help for the Armenians. If only we had known then that tyranny must be opposed early and steadfastly, perhaps this and future acts of genocide could have been prevented. 
   But the world does not learn easily. Even today, massacres take place around the world, with people murdered not for what they have done but for whom they are. 
   And we must wonder about the final goals of those who continue the blockade of Armenia and Nagorno Karabagh. We must make known to the world our opposition to such policies. We must fight to defend Section 907, cutting off American aid to those enforcing the embargo. And we must not allow the lure of cheap oil from the Caspian, an illusion, really, lead us away from the path of truth and justice. 
   To do justice to the memory of those who died we must see to it that justice is done to the living, to those who survived them. That means doing justice to Armenia, as well as to Armenians and other refugees.  
   Today, I would like to join the Armenian-American community in remembering the horrors of the Armenian Genocide. We all would profit by reflecting on the strength of the Armenian people to persevere through this awful period in history. 
   But today is not only a day to mourn those lost in this genocide but also a day to celebrate the resilience of the people of Armenia as they build a new democracy. Finally freed from communist imperialism, Armenia has quickly become one of the most democratic of the former Soviet Republics and has made great strides to adopt a market economy. I am gratified at the many cultural exchanges taking place between our two nations. 
   As chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee I also am gratified at all the wonderful examples of success through hard work that have been provided by Armenian immigrants. Such stories make the argument for a kind and open policy toward refugees, victims of latter-day massacres, much stronger. 
   I salute all Armenians today, I salute their predecessors who suffered so grievously, and I salute their struggle to let the truth be known.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on May 2, 2000, the Great Lakes Construction Alliance will hold its annual Gender and Race Diversification Excellence Awards dinner. Each year, the G.A.R.D.E. Awards are given to labor owners and contractor organizations which have made significant efforts in improving the recruitment and retention of women and people of color in the unionized construction industry. Each award winner has developed, or engaged in, some substantial program with the goal of furthering opportunities for women and people of color, which is one of the fundamental principles upon which the Great Lakes Construction Alliance was founded. 
   Nominees are judged by a jury of construction industry representatives. To be considered for the G.A.R.D.E. Award, programs must show documentation, including numbers for minorities and women, of the number of people added to the organization's labor force, and promote quality, acceptable construction practices. Ultimately, the awards are given to those programs which have made significant efforts to improve the recruitment and retention of women and people of color in the unionized construction industry. The recipients of the 2000 G.A.R.D.E. Awards are the Human Rights Department of the City of Detroit, the Greater Detroit Building and Construction Trades Council, and the Comerica Park Construction Management Team. 
   The Greater Detroit Building and Construction Trades Council, with Barton-Malow acting as program manager, formed twenty construction management teams, which together coordinated over 750,000 hours of service during the Detroit Public Schools Summer Emergency Maintenance Program. 130 minority students, thirty-seven percent of whom were female, participated in the Summer Emergency Maintenance Program. The twenty construction management teams provided these students with the opportunity to work directly with prime contractors in a multitude of capacities, including administrative activities, painting, electrical, mechanical, and plumbing. Students were also assigned a mentor who helped them develop objectives and document their work experiences. The construction management teams also prepared outcome reports, which provided guidance for educators to continue support of the students' interests once the school year began. 
   Mr. President, I applaud the Greater Detroit Building and Construction Trades Council, and the members of the twenty construction management teams, for their willingness to help these students. Undoubtedly, their efforts had a profound impact on the lives of each and every one of them. Furthermore, this is the type of work that must be done if the revitalization of Detroit is truly to come about. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate the Greater Detroit Building and Construction Trades Council on receiving the 200 Gender and Race Diversification Excellence Award.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Ms. Robin Trumbull, whom the Battle Creek Enquirer will present with a George Award Tomorrow evening. These awards are given annually to individuals who ``Don't wait around for George to do it.'' Recipients are recognized for their leadership, and they are usually individuals who have spearheaded projects. Ms. Trumbull is being honored because she is the volunteer founder and president of Amber Alert of Michigan, a nonprofit organization in Battle Creek which works to create an effective communication system between local police and radio stations to immediately alert community members in the event of a child abduction. 
   The first few hours after an abduction has occurred are the most crucial in recovering the child, and the implementation of this effective emergency broadcast plan has the potential to save the lives of many children. The organization, which started in the Dallas/Fort Worth area in the memory of Amber Hagerman, has since spread throughout the country. It has done so because of the incredible efforts of individuals like Robin Trumbull. 
   I have had the privilege of working with Ms. Trumbull on this worthwhile cause, and I think I can safely say that all residents of Michigan owe her a debt of gratitude for the work she has done to save children from being abducted, and to help recover those who have been abducted as quickly as possible. Because of her efforts, and her dedication to the children of Michigan, the Amber Alert program has been kicked off successfully. 
   I applaud Ms. Trumbull for bringing this wonderful program to the State of Michigan. I also applaud the Battle Creek Enquirer for acknowledging her tireless efforts to do so. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Ms. Robin Trumbull on receiving her George Award. I could not imagine a more deserving recipient.

The recipients of the 2000 G.A.R.D.E. Awards are the Human Rights Department of the City of Detroit, the Greater Detroit Building and Construction Trades Council, and the Comerica Park Construction Management Team. 
   Comercia Park is the new home of the Detroit Tigers. It is a breathtaking, state-of-the-art facility. In my somewhat biased opinion, it is not only the newest, but also the nicest, stadium in the Major Leagues. Its construction would not have been possible were it not for the efforts of the many people who helped to build it. The construction of Comerica Park was a conglomerate effort, which was led by the Construction Management Team of Hunt, Turner, and White, Tigers General Manager John McHale, Jr., and aided by many Detroit City organizations: the Downtown Development Authority, the Minority Business Development Council, the African American Association of Business Contractors, and the Majority Business Initiative. 
   The Comerica Park project, with the cooperation of the aforementioned individuals and organizations, and also Detroit residents, targeted specific  groups for participation in its completion. The program resulted in the participation of 25 percent minority businesses, five percent women-owned businesses, 34 percent Detroit-based businesses, and 25 percent small businesses. Workforce utilization resulted in minorities comprising 38.15 percent of employees constructing the stadium. Women comprised 4.28 percent, and another 30.53 percent were residents of Detroit. 
   Mr. President, I applaud the diverse group of people who were responsible for the building of Comerica Park. The stadium stands as a symbol of the hope that I think many Detroit residents now feel for their city. More importantly, all Michigan residents can take pride not only in the final product, but in the production itself. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate the Comerica Park Construction Management Team on receiving a Gender and Race Diversification Excellence Award.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the members of the Waverly Warriors Boys Basketball Team, who defeated Detroit Pershing 75-63 to win the Michigan High School Athletic Association Class A State Championship. This victory brought Waverly High School its first ever state title. More importantly, it brought the entire west side of Lansing together, as it was an experience enjoyed not only by the players on the team, or even the students of the school, but by the entire community. 
   Coach Phil Odlum's team went 25-2 on its way to capturing the state title. The Warriors were led by seniors Marcus Taylor and Cortney Scott, who will attend, respectively, Michigan State University and the University of Iowa on basketball scholarships in the fall. Seniors Terry Reddick, Melvin White, and Chris Miller rounded out the starting five. These five players were backed by an extremely solid bench, both in the remaining players on the team and in the community support they received. 
   In the hierarchy of athletic competition, Mr. President, high school athletics represent the last time a community is able to look out onto the playing field, or, in this case, court, and say, ``These are our kids.'' There is an attachment there, and also, I think, a certain level of pride, that cannot be found at higher levels of play. A community can embrace a team as its own because that is what it truly is. And the west side of Lansing did embrace these kids. Clad in bright yellow t-shirts, a large band of Waverly supporters staked a claim on the northernmost side of the Breslin Center in East Lansing, Michigan, and cheered on their Warriors. 
   This community spirit and support played a large role, perhaps not in the on the court success of the team, but definitely in the overall enjoyment of their accomplishment. I am sure that the championship was made all the more special for the players when their victory lap was halted by a sea of yellow shirts. And for all the students and community members who occupied those yellow shirts, I am sure it was just as wonderful an experience seeing kids that they grew up with, or watched grow up, successfully complete their run for the title. And this, Mr. President, is the aspect of high school athletics that is truly irreplaceable. 
   Mr. President, I applaud both Lansing Waverly and Detroit Pershing on the completion of very successful seasons. And, on behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate the Waverly Warriors on winning the 2000 M.H.S.A.A. Class A Boys Basketball Championship.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Latin-Americans for Social and Economic Development, Inc., a nonprofit, community based organization which has served Southwest Detroit area individuals and businesses with a variety of social and self-help services for the past thirty-one years. On May 2, 2000, LA SED will hold its annual Recognition Luncheon, an event which provides the organization the opportunity to acknowledge the efforts of outstanding Hispanic citizens of the Detroit community. 
   It is appropriate that the theme of this year's luncheon is, ``21st Century: Hispanics Count in Detroit's Future.'' Since its founding in 1969, LA SED has been instrumental in ensuring that Hispanic citizens play a large role in the Detroit community. And now, Mr. President, there is finally an excitement about the future of the city of Detroit that has not been evident for quite some time. There is a real feeling that the city's future is going to look brighter than the past. And groups like LA SED, who outwardly display their own optimism for the future of Detroit, and for the integral role that Hispanics can play, and have played, in this picture of success, are a large reason for the excitement. 
   Mr. President, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Immigration, it has been my pleasure to hold hearings on the positive contributions immigrants make to this country in areas such as science, the arts, and the armed forces. It was my pleasure to sponsor legislation awarding the Congressional Medal of Honor to Alfred Rascon, a Mexican immigrant who heroically saved the lives of men in his platoon during the Vietnam War. And though I have my critics, their unfounded attacks will have no impact on my defense of America's tradition as a nation of immigrants. Organizations like LA SED illustrate to me everyday that in this regard, I am doing the right thing. 
   Mr. President, I extend my warmest regards and appreciation to Jane Garcia, chairperson of the luncheon, and also a wonderful friend whom I have had the pleasure of working with over the years. I would also like to acknowledge Mr. Anthony F. Early, President and C.E.O. of Detroit Edison, who will be the keynote speaker of the Recognition Luncheon. Finally, I thank everyone who is involved in making LA SED such a tremendous and effective organization. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I wish LA SED continued success in the future.

Award, programs must show documentation, including numbers for minorities and women, of the number of people added to the organization's labor force, and promote quality, acceptable construction practices. Ultimately, the awards are given to those programs which have made the greatest efforts to improve the recruitment and retention of women and people of color in the unionized construction industry. The recipients of the 2000 G.A.R.D.E. Awards are the Human Rights Department of the City of Detroit, the Great Detroit Building and Construction Trades Council, and the Comerica Park Construction Management Team. 
   In 1998, the City of Detroit's Human rights Department, which is responsible for promoting and enforcing a construction workforce diversity program through its administration of Executive Order 22, recognized an increasing number of construction projects coupled with a shortage of qualified skilled trades people. Their solution to this problem was to implement a Construction Workforce Diversity Program, altering the monitoring guidelines of Executive Order 22. The new  guidelines aim at maximizing the number of Detroit residents, minorities, and women in the construction industry while maintaining the quality of the end product. They have achieved success in this regard through increased enrollment in pre-apprentice and apprentice programs; through the establishment of partnerships with residents, business leaders, trade associations, unions, and ecumenical community city agencies; through the development of an internal information network; and through the review and validation of certified payrolls, skilled trade reports and subcontractor reports. 
   Mr. President, I applaud the efforts of the Human Rights Department to diversify the City of Detroit's workforce. Their efforts serve as a wonderful example to other agencies in Detroit and throughout the State of Michigan. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate the Human Rights Department of the City of Detroit on receiving this year's Gender and Race Diversification Excellence Award.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a resolution designating October 2000 as ``Children's Internet Safety Month'' on our national promotional calendar. This resolution, which I am submitting along with my colleague, Senator MCCAIN, recognizes the valuable information and opportunities for creative development provided by the Internet. It supports parents and guardians as they work to promote children's intellectual growth by encouraging safe, positive internet use with the aid of Internet filtering and blocking technologies. 
   Filtering and blocking technologies can help parents and guardians protect their children from objectionable material. This is particularly important in those frequent instances when such material is obtained by accident, via unsolicited correspondence. With more than 5,000 new web sites appearing on the Internet each day, we must recognize the problems raised by the significant number of sites containing objectionable material (defined as material that is violent, obscene or sexually explicit). Unfortunately, one-third of all Internet web sites are devoted to objectionable material. This presents our nation with a moral challenge: to find the means to sustain the wonderful freedom of the Internet while protecting children from unwanted and potentially harmful Internet material. 
   By designating October 2000 as ``Children's Internet Safety Month'' on the nation's promotional calendar, we can help parents, guardians, and concerned community leaders in their efforts to provide responsible Internet protection for our children. We can focus public attention on this important issue and encourage development of positive, community based programs and events highlighting the need to protect children from objectionable Internet material. 
   This resolution will help empower the young people of the Internet Generation to share ideas and dreams; and to do so free from unwanted and intrusive, objectionable Internet material.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a very special event taking place next week in the State of Michigan. The city of Battle Creek and the greater Calhoun County are officially recognizing April 17-21, 2000, as Character Education Awareness Week. Character Unlimited, a group which works to raise awareness of the importance of good character and to train others to integrate character development in their organizations and areas of influence, and the Battle Creek Chamber of Commerce are cosponsors of the event. 
   Four goals have been set for the week: first, to inform the public about character education initiatives throughout Calhoun County; second, to raise awareness and interest in the importance of mentoring and role modeling; third, to address youth about the importance of character based decision making and non-violent conflict resolution; and, finally, to raise community awareness of Character Unlimited and the work of the organization. 
   Increasingly, the notion of character has found a place in the national dialogue, particularly in this, an election year. What is getting lost in the debate, I feel, is a look at where character comes from, how it is developed within children and adults alike, and the role communities can play in developing character within their youth. Good character is not innate, Mr. President, it requires conscientious education, effort and role-modeling. 
   While it goes without saying that parents hold the most important role in this process, they are not the only cog in the wheel. Schools, youth organizations, churches, synagogues, temples, civic organizations, even governmental organizations, all of these groups have the opportunity to set positive examples for children, and in doing so provide them with a clear-cut example of what is right and what is wrong. More than this, though, for they also have the ability to teach them how to appropriately fight for what is right and against what is wrong. This is positive character development, and it is within all of our grasps. 
   Mr. President, good character in an individual is not automatic, but it is always attainable. What it requires is hard work by many people. The more positive influences our communities are able to have available to children, the more children we will see developing a strong sense of character. Continuing to use basic common sense as a guide, I think it is easy to imagine what kind of a positive effect this will have on our communities. 
   Mr. President, I am truly excited about what is happening in Calhoun County April 17-21, 2000. I thank Character Unlimited and the Battle Creek Chamber of Commerce for sponsoring Character Education Awareness Week. Also, I would like to recognize Mr. Erv Brinker, Chairman of Character Unlimited, and Ms. Pat Maliszewski, Program Director, whose hard work have been essential in making this event possible. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I hope that Character Education Awareness Week is a huge success.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the exceptional work of seventeen students who are being honored on April 18, 2000, at the ``Excellence in Education'' Awards Program. Each year, the Auburn Hills Chamber of Commerce recognizes a group of students whose ability and enthusiasm have not only proved to be outstanding, but also, I am told, has managed to please their teachers on a daily basis. 
   The purpose of the event is to provide these students with a job-shadowing experience in the field of their interest. For one day, the students work with local professionals in their chosen field, providing them with an unforgettable, and also inspirational, experience. Over the years, the chosen fields have ranged from medical specialties, to creative and performing arts, to business, to technology, and many more. 
   Mr. President, I applaud the following seventeen students for their outstanding efforts, and thank the Auburn Hills Chamber of Commerce for not only recognizing them, but encouraging them to continue their enthusiastic approach to education: Jeff Austin, Letrice Hudson, Elias Numan, Bryan Phillips, Heather Zygmontowicz, Tenealle Tenwolde, Collin Lasko, Lyndsay McGarry, Kyle Morrison, Brandon See, Jamiecee Baker, Deitra Officer, Ty Bleuenstein, Monique Bramlett, Cristal Moore, Pakou Ly, and Kenneth Venable. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate them on their participation in the ``Excellence in Education'' Awards Program.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of Mr. and Mrs. Robert VanMeter, who on April 22, 2000, will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. The couple was married at a simple ceremony on a Friday evening by a clergyman named Grover W. Cleveland. Since that evening, the two have shared the highs and lows of life together, lending support and comfort to the other whenever there has been need. 
   Mr. Robert VanMeter served in the 82d Airborne in Italy. He loved his job, and was particularly fond of taking  pictures of his jumps. Mrs. JoAnn VanMeter stayed at home, raising their four children. She baked everything from hamburger buns to apple pie. The children never knew what ``store-bought'' bread and pastries were until they were teenagers and Mrs. VanMeter returned to work. 
   Thirty-nine years ago, Mr. VanMeter completed the house that the couple lives in to this day. It took him two years to build, in part because of his refusal to allow anyone to help him with any part of the process, including the electrical and plumbing. 
   Mr. and Mrs. VanMeter have five grandchildren, ages 12-25. As they did their own children, they continue to show a patience and loyalty to them. They instill into their grandchildren the same principles they passed to their children: hard work, patience, and a willingness to try new things. 
   Mr. President, on this special occasion, I congratulate Mr. and Mrs. VanMeter. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I wish them a happy 50th wedding anniversary, and best of luck in the future.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Brownfield Cleanup Cost Recovery Act. This legislation would repeal the targeted area limitation on the expense deduction for environmental remediation costs and extend the termination date of such deduction to 2004. 
   Mr. President, the Environmental Protection Agency's brownfields program is designed to help communities restore less seriously contaminated sites that have the potential for economic development. Brownfields are defined as abandoned, idled, or under-used industrial and commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination. 
   In general, costs incurred for new buildings or for permanent improvements to increase the value of a property must be capitalized--the cost must be deducted over a period of years. Some expenses, such as repairs, are currently deductible--deductible in the year in which the cost is incurred. This is also called expensing. It is a considerable financial advantage to be able to fully deduct an expense in one year rather than over many. The brownfields tax provision would include environmental remediation costs as allowable costs for expensing. This would create the financial incentive needed to bring companies in to remediate brownfields. 
   Prior to the passage of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, the tax code discouraged the remediation of environmentally damaged property. In 1996, I introduced legislation to eliminate this bias. This legislation ultimately was included as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which is now law. However, the incentive expires at the end of this year. As part of the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999, Congress passed provisions expanding upon this important community development legislation. This bill contains the same provisions that were included in the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999, which Congress passed, but President Clinton vetoed. 
   In addition, Mr. President, current law limits expensing of brownfield sites to those sites within ``targeted'' areas--defined as being a renewal community under section 198. This bill would eliminate the ``targeted area'' limitation, allowing for increased remediation in all areas, not just federal designated zones. 
   Mr. President, encouraging community renewal has long been a very important issue to me. In 1995, my first year as a Senator, I joined with Senators LIEBERMAN, SANTORUM, DEWINE and Moseley-Braun, to introduce the Enhanced Enterprise Zones Act, to stimulate job creation and residential growth in America's most distressed rural and urban communities. More recently, Senator LIEBERMAN and I introduced the American Community Renewal Act. The ACRA would provide benefits to 100 distressed communities around the country, including tax benefits designed to attract businesses and employers to Renewal Zones. It is my hope that this bill will become law this year. 
   In my opinion, Mr. President, brownfield remediation is a crucial component of any policy for community renewal if that policy is to be successful. The provisions provided in this legislation will make such remediation more likely and more common. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to give it their strong support.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to submit a concurrent resolution commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the Katyn Forest massacre. For too long, Mr. President, too much of the world has been silent concerning this horrible crime against humanity, committed by the forces of communism. Through this resolution we may join with the Polish people in reminding the world of the horrors suffered by that nation's people at the hands of Soviet forces. 
   Now that the forces of Soviet communism have been defeated, Mr. President, it is too easy to forget those whose suffering has never been properly recognized. And few suffered as did the Poles. This proud nation, so often torn apart by opposing forces through the centuries, had once again achieved independence after World War I. The infamous Hitler/Stalin pact put an end to that independence, splitting the Polish nation in half, with each half being enslaved to a separate totalitarian dictatorship. 
   The horrors visited upon the Polish people by Hitler's Nazi regime are well known, they are rightly commemorated in monuments and declarations. But the victims of Soviet communism in Poland have not had their story told. For the sake of humanity and freedom around the globe, that story must be told. This resolution is a beginning to that process. It is a first step in telling the world the full, awful truth of what was done to real people in the name of an abstract, unreal vision of Soviet humanity. 
   Sixty years ago, 21,000 Polish military officers, justice and administration personnel were slaughtered in the Katyn Forest. Today the Lower House of the Polish Parliament, the Sejm, is paying homage to these murdered patriots. These ``best sons of the nation,'' as the Sejm calls them, those who refused to give in to Soviet ideology and physical intimidation, remained loyal to the Republic of Poland, and to the values of freedom, faith and nation, to which that Republic was dedicated. They paid for their patriotism with their lives. 
   For too long, Mr. President, the awful story of this massacre has been kept from the light of day. As we pay tribute to the patriots slain in the Katyn Forest, it is only right that we pay tribute to the brave citizens of the then-Soviet Union who risked their own lives and freedom in helping disclose the events we mark today. We also should be grateful to those who, after the fall of Soviet communism, have obeyed their own sense of honor in contributing to the confirmation and documentation of this crime. 
   Now the full story of the Katyn Forest can be told. It is my hope that this story will be told throughout the United States, Europe and the rest of the world as a reminder of the inhumanities perpetrated by those enthralled to the ideology of communism. By telling this story, we can help open the hearts and minds of people everywhere to the dangers of armed ideologies. The U.S. Congress itself has recognized the importance of remembering the victims of communism. That is why, in 1993, we passed a Resolution calling for a Victims of Communism Memorial and commending the work of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation for its work toward that objective. 
   Mr. President, it is my hope that this resolution can serve to bring us closer to our brethren in Poland and to people around the world who love freedom. The price paid by the Polish people for their liberty is one for which all of us owe them a great debt of gratitude and  respect. The blood of martyrs was spilled in the Katyn Forest. Martyrs to freedom and humanity. We have a duty, in my view, to pay tribute to the sacrifice they made for us all.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the Worker Economic Opportunity Act. This bipartisan legislation, also supported by the Department of Labor, will encourage employers to provide stock options to all employees, not just executives, ensuring that all of our workers will continue to have the opportunity for an ownership stake in their company. 
   In recent years, there have been revolutionary changes in the workplace, creating new opportunities for our working families--opportunities, which for a long time, frequently existed only for a select privileged few. One of the most positive developments has been the significant increase in the availability of stock option plans for workers, specifically hourly workers. 
   The decades-old employment laws do not accommodate newer workplace innovations and their application would unfairly punish hourly workers by making their stock-option programs disproportionately expensive and complex for employers. Subsequently, recent Department of Labor legal interpretations and policies have threatened the availability of stock option plans for hourly employees. 
   Mr. President, it is imperative that Congress send a clear message that the positive developments taking hold around the country should be encouraged, not thwarted. 
   The Worker Economic Opportunity Act would send just a message, ensuring that all employees will continue to have the opportunity to share in the economic growth and success of their company formerly enjoyed only by corporate executives. Moreover, companies, especially smaller companies with high capital costs in development, will be able to maintain the capital resources necessary to compete in the rapid evolving global economy and, at the same time, reward and retain highly qualified and valued employees. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank Senator MCCONNELL for his work and dedication toward this legislation and the Department of Labor for recognizing the need to accommodate today's employee and workplace innovations. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on April 18, 2000, the Kiwanis Club of Plymouth, Michigan, with the assistance of the Plymouth Community Chamber of Commerce, the District Library, the Plymouth Historical Society, and the City of Plymouth, will honor three men whose commitment to the community has earned them a place in the Plymouth Hall of Fame. These men are being recognized because over the years their dedication and many efforts have played a large role in making Plymouth the wonderful town that it is today. With this having been said, I rise today in honor of Mr. James Jabara, Mr. James B. McKeon, and Mr. Jack Wilcox, who are rightfully taking their place among the ``Builders of Plymouth.'' 
   A graduate of Plymouth High School and the University of Michigan, Mr. Wilcox is a retired U.S. Navy captain. He has served the community of Plymouth in many, and varied, ways. A semi-professional actor, he is a charter member of the Plymouth Theater Guild. He is a past president of the Plymouth Historical Society, as well as a lifetime member of this organization. He has served as City Commissioner, and helped to organize the Plymouth Council on Aging and the Plymouth Economic Development Corporation. Mr. Wilcox is a trustee of Riverside Cemetery, a member of the Munipal Tree Board, and a member of the Block Grant Citizen's Advisory Commission. In addition, Mr. Wilcox is the host of the local cable television show ``Profiles in Plymouth.'' 
   Mr. President, I applaud Mr. Wilcox for his many efforts to better the quality of life for every resident of Plymouth, Michigan. His dedication to the town over the years is truly admirable, and I am glad that the Kiwanis Club has taken this opportunity to recognize his many contributions. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Mr. Wilcox on his induction into the Plymouth Hall of Fame.

Mr. President, on April 18, 2000, the Kiwanis Club of Plymouth, Michigan, with the assistance of the Plymouth Community Chamber of Commerce, the District Library, the Plymouth Historical Society, and the City of Plymouth, will honor three men whose commitment to that community has earned them a place in the Plymouth Hall of Fame. These men are being recognized because over the years their dedication and many efforts have played a large role in making Plymouth the wonderful town that it is today. With this having been said, I rise today in honor of Mr. James Jabara, Mr. James B. McKeon, and Mr. Jack Wilcox, who are rightfully taking their place among the ``Builders of Plymouth.'' 
   Mr. McKeon came to Plymouth after graduating from a school that I myself am quite familiar with, Michigan State University. He has served Plymouth both as City Commissioner and as Mayor. He has been president of the Plymouth Chamber of Commerce, and was named Volunteer of the Year by that organization. Mr. McKeon is chairman of the Downtown Development Authority, and sits on the Board of Directors of Growth Works and the New Morning School. In addition, he is a member of the Schoolcraft College Development Authority Board and a benefactor of the Plymouth Community Arts Council. 
   Mr. President, I applaud Mr. McKeon for his many efforts to better the quality of life for every resident of Plymouth, Michigan. His dedication to the town over the years is truly admirable, and I am glad that the Kiwanis Club has taken this opportunity to recognize his many contributions. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Mr. McKeon on his induction into the Plymouth Hall of Fame.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Mother Teresa Religious Workers Act. This legislation will make permanent provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that set aside 10,000 visas per year for ``special immigrants.'' 
   Up to 5,000 of these visas annually can be used for ministers of a religious denomination. In addition, a related provision of the law provides 5,000 visas per year to individuals working for religious organizations in ``a religious vocation or occupation'' or in a ``professional capacity in a religious vocation or occupation.'' This has allowed nuns, brothers, cantors, lay preachers, religious instructors, religious counselors, missionaries, and other persons to work at their vocations or occupations for religious organizations or their affiliates. 
   The key component of the law will expire on September 30 of this year unless Congress acts. 
   Under the law, a sponsoring organization must be a bona fide religious organization or an affiliate of one, and must be certified or eligible to be certified under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Religious workers must have two years work experience to qualify for an immigrant visa. 
   Prior to 1990, churches, synagogues, mosques, and their affiliated organizations experienced significant difficulties in trying to gain admission for a much needed minister or other individual necessary to provide religious services to their communities. However, this improvement in the law in 1990 was not made permanent and, as such, has required reauthorization every two or three years, which has created uncertainly among religious organizations. 
   Bishop John Cummins of Oakland has written:  
   Religious workers provide a very important pastoral function to the American communities in which they work and live, performing activities in furtherance of a vocation or religious occupation often possessing characteristics unique from those found in the general labor market. Historically, religious workers have staffed hospitals, orphanages, senior care homes and other charitable institutions that provide benefits to society without public funding.  
   Bishop Cummins noted that,  
   The steady decline in native-born Americans entering religious vocations and occupations, coupled with the dramatically increasing need for charitable services in impoverished communities makes the extension of this special immigrant provision a necessity for numerous religious denominations in the United States.  
   The sentiments expressed by Bishop Cummins are widely held. Indeed this program has won universal praise in religious communities across the nation. In the past, our office has received letters from religious orders and organizations throughout the nation. 
   As a nation founded by people who came to these shores so they and their children could worship freely, it is only appropriate that our country welcome those who wish to help our religious organizations provide pastoral and other relief to people around this nation. 
   That is why I have introduced the Mother Teresa Religious Workers Act. The bill will eliminate the sunset provisions in current law and extend permanently the religious workers provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act. It is clear that religious organizations' ability to sponsor individuals who provide service to their local communities should be a permanent fixture of our immigration law, just as it is for those petitioning for close family members and skilled workers. No longer should religious institutions have to worry about whether Congress will act in time to renew the religious workers provisions. I am pleased Senators KENNEDY, DEWINE, and LEAHY are cosponsoring this legislation.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dr. Peter Levine, who on April 13, 2000, will be honored by the American Lung Association of Michigan-Genesee Valley Region as its Individual Health Advocate of the Year. Each year, the organization recognizes one individual whose efforts have greatly contributed to supporting the health, education and overall well-being of the Genesee Valley community. 
   Since 1986, Dr. Levine has served as the Executive Director of the Genesee County Medical Society in Flint, Michigan, which represents over 600 physicians. As Executive Director, Dr. Levine oversees the day-to-day operations of the Medical Society, ranging from the responsibilities of its financial, policy and staffing actions, to its lobbying activities, educational programming and media relations. He also serves as the Executive Director of the Society's three subsidiaries: the Medical Society Foundation, a 501C-3 educational and social policy charitable foundation; the Physicians Programs, Inc.; and the Emergency Medical Centre of Flint, an urgent care center designed to provide a low cost alternative care site for the community at large. The Emergency Medical Centre provides care for approximately 18,000 visitors per year. 
   Prior to 1986, Dr. Levine served as Program Director for the Greater Flint Area Hospital Assembly. In this capacity, Dr. Levine directed a six-hospital cooperative venture enabling these hospitals to provide better cancer care services to their patients. He developed and implemented strategies for cooperation in research, education, bioethics, resource coordination, standards of care, fiscal strategies, communication with hospital staffs, promotion of member hospitals outside of the region, innovative programming, cancer screening, and computerized tumor registry and data system. He staffed a multi-hospital joint venture to implement Magnetic Resonance Imagery technology in the Flint area, and served as the Executive Director of Community Hospice, Inc., a multi-hospice association designed to foster hospice growth in the region. 
   Dr. Levine is also a founding board member and volunteer for the Genesee County Free Medical Clinic, and a charter member of the Michigan Hospice Organization Board of Directors. He serves on the Medicare Advisory Board for the Ninth Congressional District of Michigan, sits on the Board of Directors of Health Education Systems, Inc., and is a Consultant to Michigan State Medical Society Committees on Bioethics, on Membership Recruitment and Retention, and on Medical Economics. He is also the State Medical Society's Liaison with Blue Cross/Blue Shield, and a member of its task force on professional liability. 
   Mr. President, I applaud Dr. Levine for his outstanding work for not only Genesee County, but the State of Michigan. His efforts have contributed to a higher standard of medical care throughout the state. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Dr. Levine on being named  the Individual Health Advocate of the Year by the American Lung Association of Genesee Valley. He is truly deserving of this honor.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to today to recognize Mott Community College, which on April 13, 2000, will be honored by the American Lung Association of Michigan-Genesee Valley Region as its 1999 Corporate Health Advocate of the Year. Mott Community College is being awarded for promoting lung health in the workplace, for encouraging its employees to participate in local non-profit organizations, for demonstrating financial support to these organizations, and for exhibiting an overall dedication to improving the quality of life of residents in the Genesee Valley area. 
   Mott Community College has a definitive plan to promote lung health in the workplace consistent with the mission of the American Lung Association of Michigan. There is a ban on smoking in all college buildings, the college's health insurance providers offer various educational programs to support employees who want to quit smoking, and smoking cessation material and counseling is available at the annual Mott Community College Health Fair. The college also has a program of assistance available to all students and staff who are disabled or suffering from disease, and has expended millions of dollars to make its campus fully accessible to the whole community. 
   Mott Community College is by its very nature a community service, but the college works hard to provide more to Genesee County than educational opportunity. Within its educational programs, and particularly in the health sciences, there is an interactive community component: senior nursing students work with area schools to provide health education classes, along with basic health screening, for students; faculty and staff work with the Genesee County Health Department to train teams, working through area churches, to provide citizens with health information; and the community has access to diverse facilities and programs on campus, programs which are all aimed at improving the health of the community. 
   Mott Community College also hosts many important events where health education is the theme. The annual Mott Community College Health Fair is a popular event which brings health professionals and the community together. The college holds national mental health town meetings, including a recent public forum which Ms. Tipper Gore chaired. On February 5, 2000, the college hosted the first annual ``Family Asthma Day,'' in which three asthma specialists presented informal sessions on the management of asthma. The event also included interactive sessions for adults and children. 
   Mr. President, for over seventy-five years, Mott Community College has worked to improve the quality of life of residents in the Genesee Valley area. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Mott Community College on being named the Corporate Health Advocate of the Year by the American Lung Association of Michigan-Genesee Valley Region. This award is the representation of the hard work of many people who truly care about the Genesee County community.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to recognize Mrs. Katherine Grayson Graham Heideman, resident of Hancock, MI, who today is celebrating her 90th birthday. It is my pleasure to honor her not only for having reached this landmark birthday, which is quite an accomplishment in itself, but also, and I think more importantly, for having lived her life in a manner truly worthy of commendation. 
   Mrs. Heideman was born in Audubon, Iowa, the daughter of Katherine Grayson Brown and James Melville Graham. She was the youngest of six daughters. After attending high school in Audubon, she headed out west to continue her education, first receiving a B.A. from the University of California-Los Angeles in 1931, and then in 1934 earning an M.A. from the University of Southern California. For the next twenty years, Mrs. Heideman taught English literature classes to intermediate students in four different states: California, Michigan, Illinois, and the District of Columbia. 
   On July 6, 1934, Katherine married Bert Heideman. The couple remained together until in 1991, when Mr. Heideman passed away. They had three children together, Eric, Bert, and Eric. The eldest child unfortunately died just six months after he was born, and Mr. and Mrs. Heideman named their third child in his honor and memory. 
   In 1958, Mrs. Heideman became the first woman to be named Houghton County, Michigan, Superintendent of Schools. She served in this capacity for four years, then spent twelve years as Superintendent of the Copper Country Intermediate School System, which includes Houghton, Baraga, and Keweenaw counties. During these years, Mrs. Heideman was a pioneer in developing special education initiatives. All of her efforts culminated in 1974, when the Heideman Bill, HB5013, was passed into law in the State of Michigan. This law made it possible for an intermediate school district to own and operate a school for handicapped children. 
   In 1982, Mrs. Heideman was elected to the Hancock City Council, and there she has continued to fight not only for the rights of disabled individuals, but also for the environment and the historic preservation of Houghton county. She is the author of a resolution forbidding any nuclear or toxic waste to be transported through the city of Hancock, and of a resolution condemning the dumping of iron ore tailings into Lake Superior. Mrs. Heideman was a charter member of the Hancock Historic Preservation Commission, and continues to be a strong voice in the efforts to retain the city's old world charm. She has played an instrumental role in the attempt to get the city of Hancock recognized as being the Finnish American culture center of the United States. And, due to her efforts, a sister city relationship was formed with the citizens of Porvoo, Finland. A candidate seven times, she now begins her eighteenth year representing the first ward. 
   Mr. President, I applaud Mrs. Heideman for her selfless dedication to improving the quality of life for individuals not only in the city of Hancock, but the entire State of Michigan. She is a remarkable woman and a true role model. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I wish Mrs. Heideman a happy ninetieth birthday, and best of luck in the future.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I rise today to recognize Mr. Donald T. Storck, who on Tuesday, April 11, 2000, will be honored by the Lutheran Luncheon Club of Metropolitan Detroit as its Lutheran Layman of the Year 2000. This is the 46th year the Luncheon Club has named a Layman of the Year, and I cannot imagine that any have been more deserving than Mr. Storck. For over thirty-five years, he has displayed a dedication to both his community and his church that are representative of an incredible desire to help others. 
   Mr. Storck was born in raised in Saint Louis, Missouri. He began working for General Motors in their St. Louis Chevrolet Plant in 1957. In 1964, after graduating from Washington University, he was transferred to the G.M. Building in Detroit, where he worked as an engineer. He and his wife, Ethel Steinmann, settled down in Royal Oak, Michigan, and they have lived there, and been members of the St. Paul Lutheran Church, ever since. 
   In his thirty-six years in Royal Oak, Mr. Storck has contributed to the community in many ways. Before recycling had become popular, he was part of a paper drive activity that raised over $60,000 for building projects. He has been very active in supporting the Boy Scouts of America, involving himself in a program at the G.M. Willow Run Transmission Plant. He sits on the Board of Directors of the Royal Oak Penguins, a youth swimming club. As a volunteer for Focus: HOPE, he has spent one Saturday per month delivering food to elderly and shut-in individuals. He has worked on many Habitat for Humanity projects, is a teacher of an after-school elementary woodworking class for 1st and 2nd grade youth at the Huntington Woods Community Center, and a regular donor of blood and blood platelets. 
   His devotion to the religious community has been equally impressive. He currently serves on the Board of Elders and the Board of Trustees of St. Paul Lutheran Church, and sings in the Men's Chorus and Chancel Choir. This is in addition to serving as chief chef of the men's breakfast, a tradition which he founded. He is the current president of the Lutheran Choralaires, a popular male chorus which performs regularly throughout the metropolitan Detroit area. He has been a member of the Lutheran Laymen's League Retreat Committee, and volunteers time at the group's annual retreat. He has also been very active in the Lutheran Luncheon Club, serving as its president in 1984-85, its secretary from 1986-1995, and has sat on the Board of Directors for the last five years. 
   Recently, he has donated much of his time to helping Grace Lutheran Church in Durham, North Carolina. This ministry provides for the transport of children to and from Belaruse and places these children with host families while they receive needed surgical and medical care at the Duke University Hospital. Mr. Storck discovered the ministry when he was at the Duke University Hospital visiting his youngest grandchild, Mollie, who died at the age of two after a battle with leukemia. At a time when Mr. Storck's faith was put to the test, it never wavered; he remained committed to the church and to helping others in the name of God. 
   Madam President, I applaud Mr. Storck on his many contributions to both his church and his community. He is truly a role model, and I applaud the Lutheran Luncheon Club for taking the opportunity to recognize him as such. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Mr. Donald R. Storck on being named the 46th Lutheran Layman of the Year.

Mr. President, if I might, in the Budget Committee as we prepared the resolution to come to the floor, we were successful in making the lockbox mechanism a permanent part of the budget process and making it enforceable with a 60-vote point of order. I consider that to be a victory on this matter. 
   In the interest of setting a good precedent today, I therefore seek unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment at this time, and hope others who have similar kinds of amendments will help us to expedite the process.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr. Burton H. Boyum, who on April 13, 2000, is being honored by the Board of Directors of the Quincy Mine Hoist Association. Mr. Boyum is being recognized for his many contributions to the history and preservation of the iron and copper mining heritage in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. 
   Mr. Boyum was born in Minnesota in 1919. In 1941, he came to the Upper Peninsula, and from that time until his retirement in 1984, he served Cleveland Cliffs International as a Mining Engineer. Mr. Boyum is considered the foremost expert on the geology, mineralogy, and mining heritage of the Upper Peninsula. He has published two books and two historical videos on the subject, and has also provided many fortunate citizens with free tours of the area. 
   In his time there, Mr. Boyum has been an active member of many groups that help to preserve not only the history, but also the pure natural beauty, of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. What is important to note, I believe, is not only Mr. Boyum's involvement in these organizations, but his leadership within them. In 1957, he served as Chairman of the U.P. Section of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, and worked to preserve the World's largest steam hoist. He is the only serving member of the Board of the Quincy Mine Hoist Association who took part in its foundation in 1961, and thus has played a pivotal role in making the Association the premier preserved mine site in the State of Michigan. He hosted the first Michigan State Historical Society Annual Meeting in Marquette. He organized the first Marquette County Historical Society county-wide conference. He led the charge in forming the Michigan Iron Industry Museum; the Marquette Range Iron Mining Heritage Theme Park; the National Ski Hall of Fame, located in Ishpeming, Michigan; and the Great Lakes Olympic Training Center, located in Marquette, Michigan. And in 1996, under President Boyum's leadership, the Quincy Mine Hoist Association built the first Cog Railroad in the Midwest. 
   In 1998, due to his incredible efforts for the organization, Mr. Boyum was named the Quincy Mine Hoist Association's first Chairman of the Board. He was also recognized in perpetuity by his peers, who created the Burton H. Boyum Award in his honor. On behalf of the entire Senate, I extend a much deserved thank you to Mr. Boyum for all of his incredible work.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 85th Anniversary of the Monroe County Chapter of the American Red Cross. Since April 30, 1915, this chapter has faithfully served the citizens of Monroe County, Michigan, providing aid and comfort in times when it is needed most. 
   The Monroe County Chapter was founded by several prominent citizens of the community, many of whom were members of the National American Red Cross. During that first year, the founders conducted a membership drive, recruited an anti-tuberculosis visiting nurse, provided funds to aid the starving in Mexico and began a Red Cross Christmas Stamp campaign. These activities were just the beginning of an 85-year tradition of services that have carried the generosity of Monroe County's residents to people in need in all parts of the world. 
   In addition to its emergency disaster relief efforts to residents countywide, the Monroe County Chapter has demonstrated remarkable adaptability, enabling it to continue to meet both changing local and global needs. Since the inception of the chapter's annual  blood drive, Monroe County donors have generously given over 4,000 units of blood each year. The chapter offers courses in cardiopulmonary resuscitation, first aid, water safety, babysitting and HIV/AIDS education, and remains the primary link between U.S. armed forces personnel and their families in Monroe County. 
   Mr. President, as I was preparing this statement I was reminded once again of the essential role the American Red Cross plays in our communities. Born from the mythic efforts of Clara Barton during the Civil War, the organization currently has more than 1.3 million volunteers working under its banner, providing disaster relief services for victims of more than 66,000 disasters per year. More importantly, the American Red Cross still holds firm to the principles it was founded upon. The mission remains to prevent and alleviate human suffering wherever it may be found. That is why, when things are at their worst, it continues to be the American Red Cross and its volunteers that are there to make them better. 
   Mr. President, I applaud the Monroe County Chapter of the American Red Cross on eighty-five years of successful service to the Monroe Community, and I extend a much deserved thank you to the many staff and volunteers whose efforts throughout the years have made this event possible. On behalf of the entire Senate, I wish them continued success in the future.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will speak briefly about the resolution. I know my colleague, Senator LEVIN, will as well. 
   We rise together today to offer this resolution and to congratulate the Michigan State University Spartans men's basketball team for their outstanding victory in the NCAA championships which took place Monday night. 
   As a graduate of Michigan State, I am proud of the skill and dedication shown by our Spartans as they defeated the Florida Gators by a score of 89-76. 
   This was a well-earned victory and the culmination of a splendid season. Their 32-7 record is a sign of hard practice, teamwork and an overwhelming desire to excel. 
   It also is the result of a long history of dedication to success on the court. Mateen Cleaves, Morris Peterson, and A.J. Granger, three seniors who have been playing together for four years, spurred this team to victory throughout the year. Mateen with his incredible leadership. Morris with his clutch shooting. And A.J. with his consistent long marksmanship. 
   Mateen Cleaves, Morris Peterson, and Charlie Bell, all hail from Flint, Michigan. As a result, thousands of fans known them by their nickname, ``The Flintstones.'' These three players have been playing basketball together since elementary school. Their comradeship and loyalty to one another carried out onto the floor throughout the season, and made the Spartans team a family off the floor as well. 
   Andre Hutson, the man in the middle, was often called on to shut down the teams top player, particularly in the 1999-2000 tournament. He handled his job with a workmanlike approach that defined professionalism. 
   Mike Chappell, Jason Richardson, and Aloysius Anagonye, each provided  the Spartans with quality minutes off the bench all year, and particularly in the championship game, where they held their own against the vaunted Florida bench. 
   David Thomas and Adam Ballinger, provided valuable contributions throughout the season and the tournament, both on and off the court, often providing the Spartans with the lift they needed. And Steve Cherry, Mat Ishbia, and Brandon Smith demonstrated the total devotion of the Spartans players to the team concept both on the court and in practice. 
   Finally, a special mention must go to Head Coach Tom Izzo, who hails from Iron Mountain, Michigan, and is in only his fifth year coaching the team. Coach Izzo has proven himself to be one of the finest coaches in men's college basketball. He and his staff instilled into the Spartans a will to win second to none, exemplified by their cutthroat defense, which suffocated many potent offenses throughout the season, and particularly in the second half N.C.A.A. Tournament games. 
   Coach Izzo has served as in inspiration to his team, and to young men throughout Michigan and the nation who share the spirit and excitement of the sport of basketball. 
   I acknowledge his and his family's contribution. In fact, I had the pleasure of attending high school with his wife, Lupe. 
   Mr. President, I had the opportunity to attend the championship game, and I want to compliment everyone associated with the Spartans for the courage and class they exhibited throughout the game, and during the entire season. Everyone in Michigan--from Copper Harbor to Monroe, to Niles--should be proud of what this team has accomplished. 
   In closing, let me say, as a graduate of Michigan State University and as one who attended Michigan State at a time when our basketball program was not as successful as it has been since Magic Johnson's arrival in 1978 and in the time since, how proud I am of my alma mater for this great victory for the Spartans green and white. 
   I yield the floor to my colleague.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Travel, Tourism, and Jobs Preservation Act. This bill makes the Visa Waiver Pilot Program permanent and strengthens the documentation and reporting requirements established under the pilot program. 
   This legislation is important not only because it facilitates travel and tourism in the United States, thereby creating many American jobs, but also because it benefits American tourists who wish to travel abroad, since visa requirements are generally waived on a reciprocal basis. 
   The Visa Waiver Pilot Program authorizes the Attorney General to waive visa requirements for foreign nationals traveling from certain designated countries as temporary visitors for business or pleasure. Aliens from the participating countries complete an admission form prior to arrival and are admitted to stay for up to 90 days.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in October of 1993, the State of Michigan Family Independence Agency commemorated the first anniversary its landmark welfare reform initiative, To Strengthen Michigan Families, by naming its first Achiever of the Month. In each month since, the award has been given to an individual who participates in the initiative and has shown outstanding progress toward self-sufficiency. I rise today to recognize Ms. Dionne A. Cole, who was the recipient of the award for the month of March, 2000. 
   Ms. Cole is the single mother of a three-year-old son. She began receiving assistance from the Family Independence Agency in September of 1999. Though at this time she was a single mother with no job experience, through a self-initiated job search Ms. Cole obtained employment as a security guard for Strategic Protection Group that same month. To ease the transition,  F.I.A. assisted Ms. Cole with child care and provided her with funds to purchase a car. 
   In December of 1999, her cash assistance from F.I.A. ended because of earned income. Nonetheless, by budgeting her money wisely, Ms. Cole recently has signed the lease on her first apartment. With the help of her Family Independence Specialist, electric and heat accounts were established for her at this residence. 
   Ms. Cole has her high school diploma and would like to attend Wayne County Community College to study Business Management. Her ultimate goal is to own her own beauty shop. 
   Mr. President, I applaud Ms. Dionne Cole for being named Achiever of the Month for March of 2000. It is an honor for which she has worked very hard and she truly deserves. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Ms. Cole, and wish her continued success in the future.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am honored to rise today in recognition of David and Doreen Hermelin, long-time residents of Detroit, Michigan. The couple recently returned home from Norway, where Mr. Hermelin served as United States Ambassador. On June 6, 2000, the Hermelins will be honored by Hillel Day School, an independent Conservative Jewish Day School located in Farmington Hills, Michigan. Together, they will receive the 2000 Dream Maker Award, which recognizes the achievements of a person or persons who are committed to the cause of Jewish education, and also the Rabbi Jacob Segal Award, given annually in blessed memory of Rabbi Segal, one of the founders of Hillel Day School. 
   Mr. and Mrs. Hermelin have often been recognized for their dedication to the Jewish community, both nationally and internationally. Before his ambassadorship, Mr. Hermelin served as the International Chairman of State of Israel Bonds, and as Vice-Chair of United Jewish Appeal. He has been honored by the State of Israel with the Golda Meir Leadership Award, given the Knights of Charity Award by the Archdiocese of Detroit, and received the Golden Menorah Award for Community Service from B'nai B'rith. Mrs. Hermelin is a recipient of the Women of Valor Award from the State of Israel Bonds, the Humanitarian Award from B'nai B'rith, the Heart of Gold from the United Foundation, and was also named the Woman of the Year by B'nai B'rith Women. 
   The Hermelin's philanthropic and humanitarian work has extended well past the bounds of their faith. Mrs. Hermelin currently serves on the Board of Directors of the Michigan Foundation for the Arts and on the Board of Trustees of the Michigan Opera Theater and the Michigan Parkinson's Foundation. She is a member of the Cranbrook Art Association and the Women's Committee of the Michigan Lung Association. Mr. Hermelin serves on the Board of Directors of the Community Foundation for Southeastern Michigan, the Greater Detroit Interfaith Round Table, and the Detroit Symphony Orchestra Hall. He sits on the Board of Trustees of the Michigan Developmental Foundation and on the Advisory Board of the United Way for Southeastern Michigan. Together, David and Doreen have volunteered their efforts on behalf of Friends of Modern Art of the Detroit Institute of Arts and the Children's Hospital of Michigan. 
   Mr. President, I am sure that June 6 will be a special day for David and Doreen Hermelin. They have long supported Hillel Day School, and their eldest of six grandchildren, Matthew Orley, will also be rewarded by the school this spring, with his high-school diploma. 
   It is my hope that these two events remind David Hermelin and Doreen Curtis how far they have come since they first met at Camp Tamakwa in 1949. I also hope that they take the time to think about just how many lives they have touched with their many charitable efforts. 
   Mr. President, I would like to welcome Ambassador and Mrs. Hermelin back to metropolitan Detroit. While I do appreciate the work the couple did in Norway, it is my preference that they stay in Michigan for a while. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate David and Doreen Hermelin on receiving the 2000 Dream Maker Award and the Rabbi Jacob Segal Award, and I applaud Hillel Day School for recognizing this magnificent pair.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in honor and in memory of a dear friend of mine, Mr. Jim Cash, who passed away on March 24 at the age of 59. Jim is internationally recognized as a screenplay writer. He co-wrote the movies ``Top Gun,'' ``The Secret of My Success,'' ``Dick Tracy,'' and ``Turner and Hooch,'' among others. I would like to recognize him today, however, not for his writing achievements, but for his contributions to the Lansing, Michigan, community, and the campus of our alma mater, Michigan State University. It is there, I believe, where his words found their most attentive listeners. It is also there where they had their most profound effects. 
   Jim began teaching a film history course at Michigan State in 1974, taking the job as an adjunct professor. He hoped only to earn some money to continue his screenplay writing. When he and co-writer Jack Epps, Jr., a former student, found success together in the mid-1980's, it would have been easy for Jim to leave Michigan State behind for the brighter pastures of Hollywood. Instead, Jim stayed in Lansing. He stayed because he had discovered that he loved to teach as much as he loved to write. And the reason that he loved teaching was because he loved instilling into his students the same love for writing and for film that he had. Witnessing this process occur in his students never got old. He stayed, Mr. President, because he realized that with his teaching he had a true impact on the lives of individuals, something he could not have attained in Hollywood, not on the same level as he could at Michigan State. 
   Jim taught more than just the six-hundred students who often filled his classrooms, though. He and his wife, Cynthia, were very active in Lansing community fine arts programs, volunteering their time throughout the area. They provided money for the creation of many fine arts scholarships. Jim also helped to write and direct a production at East Lansing High School entitled ``4 Years to Life,'' which dramatized the rigors of high school life. In the last year of his life, Jim and Cynthia could often be found at the Silverscreen Caf&#233;, a coffee shop that they owned together. 
   Mr. President, with his writing ability, Jim forever left his mark on Hollywood. With his incredible spirit and immense knowledge, he forever left his mark on Lansing, Michigan, Michigan State University, and thousands upon thousands of students. And with his personality, he forever left his mark on anyone who had the chance to meet him. Plain and simple, he was an incredible man, and he will be greatly missed.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, Alternatives for Girls is an organization which provides aid and assistance to vulnerable young women in the metropolitan Detroit area. Founded in 1987, Alternatives for Girls remains committed to its original mission of helping homeless and high-risk girls and young women avoid violence, teen pregnancy, and exploitation, while at the same time helping them explore and access the support, resources and opportunities necessary to be safe, to grow strong, and to make positive choices for their lives. It has been recognized by Newsweek as a social service agency that works, and named one of the best managed non-profit organizations in the Detroit area by Crain's Business Weekly. 
   Each year, the Alternatives For Girls selects two female role models to receive its Role Model Award. With this award, the organization seeks to identify and honor women who, through their professional accomplishments, personal attributes, and demonstrated commitment to community, affirm the principles embodied in Alternative For Girls' purpose, and provide inspiration  and concrete examples of what women can attain when afforded the opportunity and the guidance to make positive life choices. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor Dr. Maureen A. Fay and Ms. Pamela Rodgers, who will receive the Alternatives For Girls Role Model Award at the 11th Annual Role Model Dinner, on April 6, 2000. 
   Dr. Fay has lived a life dedicated to education. Before graduating from the University of Chicago with a doctorate in social sciences in 1976, she taught at the University of Illinois, Northern Illinois University, and DePaul University. After her graduation, she became Dean of Continuing Education and Graduate Studies at Saint Xavier University in Chicago. In 1983, she was named president of Mercy College of Detroit. In 1990, when Mercy College consolidated with the University of Detroit, she became the first president of the University of Detroit-Mercy. She has served in this position for the last ten years, focusing her efforts on the growth and revitalization of Michigan's largest Catholic University. 
   Dr. Fay is active, and provides leadership, in a variety of educational organizations. She serves on the executive committee of the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities, the executive committee of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities, is a member of the Association of Mercy Colleges, and is a member of the executive committee of the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of Michigan. 
   Dr. Fay has also been extremely active in the Detroit area. She currently serves on the boards of Bank One Corporation, Kelly Services, Inc., the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation, the Economic Club of Detroit, New Detroit, Inc., the National Conference for Community and Justice, and the Endowment Foundation for the Archdiocese of Detroit. In March of 1996, she was appointed by Mayor Dennis Archer to the Greater Downtown Partnership, Inc., an initiative to spearhead downtown economic revitalization and development. 
   Mr. President, I applaud Dr. Maureen Fay on her many remarkable achievements, and commend her for her dedication to improving the city of Detroit. Dr. Fay is truly a role model for women not only in Detroit but across the nation, and I am glad that Alternatives For Girls has recognized her as such. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate Dr. Fay on receiving the Alternatives For Girls Role Model Award.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor Dr. Maureen A. Fay and Ms. Pamela Rodgers, who will receive the Alternatives For Girls Role Model Award at the 11th Annual Role Model Dinner, on April 6, 2000. 
   After graduating with an M.B.A. from Duke in 1983, Ms. Pamela Rodgers returned to her hometown of Detroit, Michigan, to work as a financial analyst for Ford Motor Company. In 1988, she was admitted into the Ford Minority Dealer Development Program. In early 1993, Ms. Rodgers was finally given the opportunity she desired, when she took over General Motor's Flat Rock Dealership. 
   Since Ms. Rodgers became owner, the Flat Rock Dealership, now Rodgers Chevrolet, has prospered in every way. In 1995, G.M. named it number one in ``service satisfaction'' for the entire Detroit area. When Ms. Rodgers first took over in 1993, annual sales were under $15 million. In 1998, Rodgers Chevrolet eclipsed the $48 million sales mark, sold an average of 180 new and used vehicles per month, including fleet sales to large companies like Detroit Edison, and hired fifteen new employees. 
   Ms. Rodgers is active in a number of civic and professional organizations. She is a member of the Board of Family Services, the National Black M.B.A. Association, and the Women's Automotive Issues. She sits on the Board of Directors of the National Association of Minority Automobile Dealers and the General Motors Minority Dealers Association. 
   Mr. President, Ms. Pamela Rodgers has been a true pioneer in the automobile industry. No one has opened the doors for her, rather, it has been her hard work and will to succeed that have forced them open. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I congratulate her on being named as an Alternatives For Girls Role Model. It is an honor she truly deserves.

   In its thirteen years, Alternatives For Girls has grown from a small, volunteer-run program into a multi-service agency. It now has a staff of over fifty employees, one-hundred and seventy active volunteers, and an annual operating budget of over $2 million. It has been honored by Crain's Detroit Business Weekly as one of the best-managed non-profit organizations in the Detroit metropolitan area, and has also been named by Newsweek as a social service agency that works. 
   Mr. President, the staff and volunteers of Alternatives For Girls hold the firm conviction that they can make a difference in the lives of girls and young women in metropolitan Detroit by helping them build the foundations for trust, responsibility and success; by providing them with educational support and vocational guidance to become to become self-sufficient; by counselling them and linking them with the resources they need to build safe and healthy lives; and by listening to their concerns, responding to their needs, standing by them in times of frustration, and congratulating them in times of success. 
   Alternatives For Girls has three program areas, a Prevention Program, a Crisis Shelter and Transition to Independent Living Program, and a Street Outreach Program. The Prevention Program serves girls, ages 5-17, and their families, who are at risk for school dropout, early pregnancy, and involvement with gangs, drugs, and violence. The Crisis Shelter and Transition to Independent Living Program serves homeless girls and young women, ages 16-20, who are not in the foster care or judicial system. And through the Street Outreach Program, staff and volunteers provide support, referrals and other necessities to girls and young women who are involved in prostitution, substance abuse, gang activity and unhealthy relationships. 
   Mr. President, I applaud the staff and volunteers of Alternatives For Girls for their tremendous efforts to help the girls and young women of metropolitan Detroit. Their efforts have changed hundreds of lives, whether by providing  mentoring services, overseeing and aiding the transition to independent living of a homeless young woman, or offering counseling in a time of need. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I not only commend the staff and volunteers of Alternatives For Girls for their work, but also give them a much deserved thank you.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Hope Network, S.E., an organization which will hold its Fifth Anniversary Celebration on April 9, 2000. Since it opened in 1994, Hope Network, S.E. has provided disabled and disadvantaged individuals of Oakland, Macomb, and Wayne Counties not only with places to live, but, more importantly, with communities to live in. 
   Hope Network, S.E. is a member organization of the Hope Network, which employs more than 2000 people and operates from more than 130 different locations throughout the state of Michigan. The mission of Hope Network is to enhance the dignity and independence of people who have disabilities and/or are disadvantaged. The foundation of its efforts is the belief that every individual is created in the image of God and therefore has intrinsic worth and dignity. 
   The primary goal of Hope Network, S.E. is to provide the highest quality of living for people with disabilities. This is done by respecting the dignity and independence of these individuals, by giving them the opportunity to offer input and make decisions about their own personalized plan of service. The success of Hope Network, S.E. lies in this process, for it is a process which encourages disabled individuals to become involved in community and social activities. 
   Part of the Fifth Anniversary Celebration is an art show and auction. The pieces of art on display were created at The Art Experience, a gallery in Oakland County which offers art therapy for mentally ill individuals. Its biggest client, not surprisingly, is Hope Network, S.E. Employees of Hope Network, S.E. transport individuals, men and women who usually do not like to stray far from their homes, twenty-five miles to The Art Experience. I am told that it is a place where disabilities, though they do not disappear, are briefly forgotten. 
   Mr. President, I applaud Hope Network, S.E. Executive Director Pat Crandall, and her many employees and volunteers, for five years of successful service to Oakland, Macomb and Wayne Counties. Their dedication and selfless efforts have touched numerous lives and indelibly left their mark on these communities. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I wish Hope Network, S.E. a happy fifth anniversary. I hope that the coming years are as successful as the first five have been.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of Ms. Diane Ransom-McGhee, who on March 31, 2000, will be honored by the Wayne Metro Division of the Office of Juvenile Justice for twenty-seven years of service to the families and children of the State of Michigan. Early in her life, Ms. Ransom-McGhee decided that she wished to work in the field of Human Services, and over the past twenty-seven years she has continually demonstrated not only a love for helping people, but also impressive leadership capabilities. 
   Ms. Ransom-McGhee has worked at a number of organizations in the Detroit metropolitan area: from 1972 to 1979 she worked at the Wayne County Department of Social Services, from 1979 to 1986 she worked as a Child Welfare Specialist at the State of Michigan Children Youth and Services, from 1988 to 1989 she worked as the Director of the Monte Vista Reception Center, from 1989 to 1994 she worked as a Clinical Director in the State of Michigan Burton Youth Reception Center, from 1994 to 1997 she worked as the Administrative Director of Wayne Metro Day Treatment Services for juvenile delinquents, and in 1997 she returned to Burton Youth Reception Center to serve as its Director. 
   In addition to her work in the Human Services field, Ms. Ransom-McGhee has a number of outside interests. She is a board member of the State of Michigan Judiciary Detention Association; she is a Youth Counselor Consultant of the Girl Scouts of America; she is an Advisor Consultant of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Youth Council, she is a sponsor of the N.A.A.C.P. Black College Tour and Mentorship program; and she is a Youth Minister and Sunday School teacher at the New Hope Missionary Baptist Church. 
   Ms. Ransom-McGhee has received several awards for her dedication to her work and to her community. In 1996, she received the Pastoral Community Service Award. In 1997, she received the Director of the Year Award from the State of Michigan Office of Juvenile Justice. And in 1998, the city of Southfield, Michigan, awarded her with its Community Pride Award. 
   On April 1, 2000, Ms. Ransom-McGhee will assume new duties as Assistant Division Director at the Wayne County Juvenile Detention Center. Mr. President, I applaud Ms. Ransom-McGhee for her dedication to her job and her tireless work over the past twenty-seven years. She is a role model for us all. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I wish her the best of luck in her new position.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on April 1, 2000, the Southeastern Michigan Chapter of the American Red Cross will hold its seventh annual Rhapsody in Red Masquerade Ball, a celebration which allows its patrons to enjoy themselves and to support one of the most noble causes our country has ever known at the same time. I rise today not only to honor this occasion, but also to bestow praise and thanks upon an organization that truly deserves both. 
   Since 1994, this annual gala has raised over one million dollars for the Southeastern Michigan Chapter. The Rhapsody in Red Masquerade Ball plays a significant role in allowing this chapter to continue its disaster relief efforts in Macomb, Oakland, and Wayne counties. The annual event also provides members of the community with an opportunity to recognize the tireless efforts of the administrative staff and the volunteers of the Southeastern Michigan Chapter, and to appropriately thank them for these efforts. 
   In 1999 alone, the Southeastern Michigan Chapter provided disaster relief to more than 6,000 individuals. More than 14,000 volunteers offered their time to the chapter, collectively working more than 500,000 hours. I am proud to say that, of the fifty states, Michigan ranks fourth in the nation for exporting volunteers into emergency zones, and the efforts and organization of the Southeastern Michigan Chapter undoubtedly play a role in this success. In addition, through its Blanket Days for the Homeless Campaign, an operation spearheaded by fourteen volunteers, the Southeastern Michigan Chapter collected over 13,000 blankets, which were then distributed to seventy homeless shelters in Wayne, Oakland and Macomb counties. Recently, in response to an increase in residential fires, the Southeastern Michigan Chapter maintained 24-hour Disaster Action Teams, formed from a pool of sixty-four trained volunteers. 
   Mr. President, as I was preparing this statement I was reminded once again of the essential role the American Red Cross plays in our communities. Born from the mythic efforts of Clara Barton during the Civil War, the organization currently has more than 1.3 million volunteers working underneath its banner, providing disaster relief services for victims of more than 66,000 disasters per year. More importantly, the American Red Cross still holds firm to the principles it was founded upon. Its mission remains to prevent and alleviate human suffering wherever it may  be found. That is why, when things are at their worst, it continues to be the American Red Cross and its volunteers that are there to make them better. 
   Mr. President, I applaud the administrative staff and volunteers of the Southeastern Michigan Chapter of the American Red Cross for their remarkable efforts. Every day they remind the people of Michigan that the spirit of Clara Barton is alive and well. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I hope that the Red Rhapsody Masquerade Ball is a success for a seventh time.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Youth Connection, a strategic, non-profit prevention campaign with a ten-year goal of reducing youth violence, substance abuse and early sexual activity in Detroit, Michigan. The organization was founded to provide the youth of metropolitan Detroit with a sense of belonging to the present, and also with a sense of hope and inspiration for the future. 
   Presently, in coordination with Detroit Public Schools, Mt. Clemens Community Schools and the School District of Pontiac, Youth Connection is promoting an activity called Free 4 the Weekend, which encourages students within these districts to remain drug free during a designated weekend in April. 
   Mr. President, statistics tell us that eighty-seven percent of high school seniors report using alcohol. In addition, middle and high school students drink nearly thirty-five percent of all wine coolers consumed in the United States. These patterns have devastating consequences. Research shows that most youth misconduct and violence takes place after school between the hours of 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. It is my belief that by supporting and enhancing after school programs, expanding the ``Safe Night'' initiatives in partner communities, and expanding youth leadership programs and activities, we can enhance the quality of life for all metropolitan Detroit youth. 
   Mr. President, with Alcohol Awareness Month just a few days away, I applaud Youth Connection for encouraging the youth of metropolitan Detroit to remain sober. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, and also the State of Michigan, I would like to thank them for their efforts.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on March 31, 2000, the Saginaw County Commission on Aging will hold a luncheon honoring four women who have selflessly dedicated a significant amount of their time and their energy to improving the community of Saginaw, Michigan. Their tremendous efforts over the years have not only touched a great many lives, they have truly changed lives, whether by providing those in need with food and clothing, saving seniors hundreds of dollars in medical insurance payments, mentoring elementary school students, or helping people to understand and accept a culture different from their own. Thus, I rise today on behalf not only of myself, but also of the entire Saginaw County, Michigan, community, to sincerely thank Ms. Hazel Wilson, Ms. Mary Flannery, Ms. Sue Kaltenbach, and Ms. Yoko Mossner for their incredible efforts. 
   Ms. Hazel Wilson has been a Saginaw community leader for more than thirty years. Her charitable endeavors include working for the Family Indepence Agency in the 1960s, counseling laid-off auto workers for the UAW-GM Human Resource Center in the late eighties, serving on the Board of Trustees for the Saginaw Public Schools, and also serving on the Board of Directors for the Saginaw Voluntary Action Center. For the last ten years, she has been employed by the Saginaw County Community Mental Health Authority as a Prevention Coordinator. 
   Ms. Wilson demonstrated her outstanding leadership capabilities, and indelibly left her mark on the Saginaw community, when in the early 1970s she established the Good Neighbors Mission. Ms. Wilson's original goal in establishing this organization was to provide needy families with food and clothing. But because of her dedication the Good Neighbors Mission has continually grown, to the point where today it stands as a community resource center, a hub of activity, and, I am told, a virtual clearinghouse, where people can find help fulfilling much more than just their food and clothing needs. 
   Aside from working as a Prevention Coordinator, Ms. Wilson is also currently a member of the Zion Baptist Church, Zeta Phi Beta sorority, the Michigan T.A.G. Workgroup, and the  Michigan Prevention Association. I take great pride in recognizing community-oriented constituents like Ms. Wilson, and I applaud the Saginaw County Commission on Aging for ensuring that her efforts are not overlooked. On behalf of the United States Senate, I extend gratitude to Ms. Wilson for her dedication and work for her community.

Thus, I rise today on behalf not only of myself, but also of the entire Saginaw County, Michigan, community, to sincerely thank Ms. Hazel Wilson, Ms. Mary Flannery, Ms. Sue Kaltenbach, and Ms. Yoko Mossner for their incredible efforts. 
   Ms. Mary Flannery has been a resident of Saginaw, Michigan, long enough to remember that an ice cream cone once cost a mere three cents there. For many years, she was an employee of the Family Independence Agency. Fortunately for the citizens of Saginaw, no one has reminded Ms. Flannery that she has in fact retired from her position there. She remains a regular fixture at local hospitals and nursing homes, and also continues to volunteer her time at the Commission on Aging. 
   At the Commission on Aging, she shares the knowledge and skills she collected while working at the Family Independence Agency, assisting seniors who have questions related to Medicare, Medicaid, and general health insurance. I am told that Ms. Flannery's expertise, and her willingness to venture beyond the call of duty, have saved Saginaw's seniors thousands of dollars they may have spent on duplicated medical bills or services. I guess when one has lived their life aiding individuals in need, even retirement cannot prevent them from continuing to do so. 
   Mr. President, on behalf of the entire United States Senate, I take pride in extending gratitude to Ms. Mary Flannery for her dedication to making the lives of others better. She is truly a role model for us all.

   Ms. Sue Kaltenbach has been a resident of Saginaw County for thirty-seven years. During this time, she has served the Saginaw Township Community School Board in many ways: as president, vice president, secretary and treasurer. She was also once president of the Saginaw County School Board Association, a vice president of the Assistance League of Saginaw, president of the Saginaw County Lawyer's Auxiliary. In addition, Ms. Kaltenbach served the Junior League of Saginaw Valley as a corresponding secretary and the Street Smarts Investment Club as recorder. 
   Ms. Kaltenbach has been a mentor at Coulter Elementary School since 1996, as part of the H.O.S.T.S. program. She participates on the Election Scheduling Committee for Saginaw County, and is involved with numerous educational programs dealing with art, literature, drug abuse prevention and law related education. She is also chairperson of Family in Action, a former member of the Christian Service Commission and the Paris Council and a member at St. Stephen's Church. 
   Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Ms. Kaltenbach is that she has managed to do all of this while placing her primary focus upon raising her own three children. Mr. President, on behalf of the entire United States Senate, I applaud Ms. Sue Kaltenbach for her outstanding contributions to her community.

   During the forty-three years that she has lived in Saginaw County, Ms. Yoko Mossner has become involved with numerous organizations. She served as president and treasurer of People to People Chapter Seven, was a member of the Board of Trustees of People to People International, and has also held various leadership roles in the Saginaw's Culture Club, the Women's National Farm and Garden Association, the Saginaw County Lawyers' Auxiliary, and the Valparaiso University Guild. She is a former member of the Saginaw Zonta Club, and is currently a member of the Good Shepherd Lutheran Church. 
   More importantly, Ms. Mossner has played a leading role in finding Japanese culture a place in Saginaw County. For the last six years, she has served as volunteer director for the Japanese Cultural Center and Tea House, a project that was made possible by her efforts as a member of the Board of Trustrees of the Saginaw County Building Fund Committee. She also serves as Special Envoy and Liaison Officer from Saginaw to its Sister City, Tokushima, Japan. Undoubtedly, her efforts in this regard have played a significant role in expanding the cultural awareness of an entire community. 
   Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Ms. Mossner is that she has managed to do all of this while placing her primary focus upon raising her own three children. Mr. President, on behalf of the entire United States Senate, I applaud Ms. Mossner for her dedication to expanding the cultural knowledge in Michigan. I am sure that the effects of her work are immeasurable.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Compassion for Children and Child Support Enforcement Act. This important legislation would ensure that children from single parent households will have the financial support necessary for a healthy, happy and secure childhood. 
   Mr. President, over one quarter of today's American children live in a single-parent household. These children are more likely to live in poverty than children living in homes where both parents are present. Children growing up in a state of poverty suffer from far reaching, long-term effects: inadequate education, lack of access to quality health care and instability arising from lack of affordable housing frequently leads to poorer health, lower earning potential and greater instability as an adult. 
   Tragically, the financial hardship endured by many of these children is avoidable--simply put, Mr. President, these children are suffering because their absent parent has chosen to shirk his parental obligations and refuse to provide his child with the financial support he or she deserves and so desperately needs. According to the Federal Office of Child Support in its preliminary report for 1998, over $50 billion in accumulated unpaid child support is due to over 30 million children in the United States. This dismal statistic is due to the 23 percent collection rate in cases handled by overwhelmed state agencies. 
   Of the children living in a household with only one present parent, 40 percent are not eligible for child support because paternity has not been established or a support order has not been issued by the courts. Of the remaining 60 percent with established paternity and a support order, only half actually receive any financial support from their absent parent and more than half will not receive the full amount of their support payments. 
   The Compassion for Children and Child Support Enforcement Act would work to decrease the rate of delinquent child support payments and increase the rate of paternity establishment. 
   Mr. President, the Department of the Treasury is in the unique position to address problems arising from a lack of resources, organization and communication which frequently arise in child support cases involving two or more jurisdictions, by allowing the Internal  Revenue Service to collect child support in the same manner that taxes are collected and then disburse the payments to the custodial parents with penalties and interest if applicable. The IRS is already the most effective means by which child support is collected under the entire state/federal child support program nexus through its system of federal tax intercepts. 
   By taking over responsibility of enforcing all child support orders through routine withholding of support from obligated parents and the use of the enforcement tools at its disposal to collect from delinquent parents, the Department of Treasury would significantly reduce the demands on State judicial resources now devoted to child support enforcement. And, Mr. President, by reducing the drain on State resources in the area of support enforcement, States would be able to better focus on establishing paternity for the 40 percent of children currently unable to even file for a support order due to lack of recognized paternity. 
   Congress failed again and again to find a way to ensure that families receive the child support that is owed to them by deadbeat parents. Despite reforms in 1984, 1988, 1993 and most recently in 1996, there have not been any significant improvements in the rate of child support collections. 
   The Compassion for Children and Support Enforcement Act represents a unique opportunity to pass effective and efficient child support enforcement legislation which creates state /federal partnerships by capitalizing on the strengths of the governments, agencies and networks already in place. Chairman HYDE has already introduced this legislation in the House of Representatives, where it enjoys the bipartisan support of 21 cosponsors. It is my sincerest hope that my colleagues in the Senate will follow the lead of the House and demonstrate their support for ensuring that our children receive the financial support necessary for them to grow into healthy and productive citizens.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in my State of Michigan, we currently have less than a 3 percent rate of unemployment. 
   We used to think that just the people entering and leaving the job market, as well as those switching jobs, would keep unemployment to a minimum of 5 percent. 
   But our economy is exceptionally strong, and the demand for labor is through the roof. In fact, some companies in Michigan have threatened to leave the State because they can't find enough people to work. 
   Yet throughout the United States, we encourage our seniors between the ages of 65 and 69 to not work because of the earnings test on their Social Security benefits. 
   At the very time that we need experienced workers in the labor market, the government makes it uneconomical for our most experienced workers to stay in the work force. 
   Under the current earnings test, Social Security beneficiaries under the age of 65 lose $1 of social Security benefits for every $2 they earn over $10,000 per year. 
   And those under 70 lose $1 for every $3 earned over $17,000 of annual income. 
   Not until they reach 70 years of age are seniors free to work again on their own terms. 
   Seniors are being penalized by double taxation--and in this case, simply for working. 
   I find it incredible that we force our seniors to forego over $3.9 billion a year in Social Security benefits simply because they make more than $10,800 if they are under 65 and $17,000 if they are between 65 and 69 years of age. 
   But what is not seen is the income foregone by those seniors for whom the earnings test makes it uneconomical to work. 
   A recent study by the Institute for Policy Innovation shows that your typical 67-year-old married senior, making let's say the American average of $37,000, could have a marginal tax rate of over 80 percent. 
   This is a huge disincentive to continue working, even though we need these experienced seniors in our work force, many of them want to work, and they are able to do so. 
   In fact, a recent study by the Urban Institute indicated that because of longer life expectancies and better medical care, a 65-year-old today is healthier than a 40-year-old was before World War II. 
   This has the effect of forcing able workers out of the work force. In 1948, 47 percent of men over 65 worked. Today, it's one-third of that with about 16 percent continuing to work. 
   And if they do work, they limit how much they work because of the earnings test. In fact, 65 percent of those seniors that work, keep their total earnings under the earnings test limit in order to avoid the penalties. 
   But if we repealed the earnings test, we could unleash the economic power of our seniors. 
   The National Bureau of Economic Research estimates that repealing the earnings test on workers age 65 to 69 would increase the annual number of hours worked throughout the economy by 5.3 percent. 
   That may not seem to be much, but it actually represents 63 million more hours worked per year, or the equivalent of almost 31,500 jobs. 
   Because seniors would have more money to save, invest, and spend, it's estimated that overall gross domestic product would rise by $19.5 billion, increasing the projected growth in disposable personal income by more than 5 percent. 
   And this would ripple throughout the economy, adding $6.8 billion to the stock of U.S. capital invested in new jobs. 
   Finally, the extra growth that would be brought about by this repeal would generate enough new tax collections to totally offset the higher Social Security benefit payments within 10 years. 
   That is why I was proud to join Senator MCCAIN last year in cosponsoring S. 279 to repeal this antiquated test and allow our seniors to keep all of their Social Security benefits. And that is why I will also support passage of H.R. 5. 
   But I think we need to look at the broader issues of retirement security, including the taxation of Social Security benefits, and the forced depletions of individual retirement accounts. 
   In 1993, the President forced through an increase on the amount of Social Security benefits subject to taxation from 50 to 85 percent for those singles making more than $34,000 and those couples making over $44,000. 
   When coupled with the earnings test, these benefits taxes can punish some couples with a 103 percent marginal tax rate. These couples actually lose more than a dollar for making another dollar. Not only is this grossly unfair, it's also an even further disincentive for savings and work. 
   But the government's raid on senior's retirements assets doesn't even stop there. It also levies a 50 percent tax on IRA savings when seniors fail to withdraw when Washington wants them withdrawn. 
   Current law requires seniors to start withdrawing their IRA savings beginning at age 70 1/2 . 
   And seniors must usually make these withdrawals in annual amounts large enough to deplete the entire IRA by the time they reach age 85. 
   Failure to follow these rules earns a whopping 50 percent penalty. 
   This withdrawal requirement can only be viewed as a punishment for those who plan and save for retirement. Even worse, seniors who live past 85 may find themselves short on funds because the Federal Government forced them to spend their own savings. That's not right, and it must be stopped. 
   To remedy all of these gross disincentives to seniors planning and saving for their retirement, and staying active in the work force, I introduced the Senior Citizens' Financial Freedom Act, S. 2180. 
   This legislation would accomplish three objectives: 
   First, it would repeal the Social Security earnings test working penalty on seniors, just as the legislation before us today would. 
   Second, it would roll back the Clinton administration's 1993 tax increase on Social Security benefits. 
   Finally, it would increase the age when minimum IRA distributions must begin, from 70 1/2 to 85. 
   Passage of H.R. 5 is vitally important to the financial well being of our seniors who chose to remain in the work force. 
   And I hope we will continue to work toward truly protecting the financial well-being of America's seniors by also addressing this year the other issues of Social Security benefits taxation and forced IRA withdrawals. 
   With these two important pieces of legislation, we can really strengthen Social Security for our seniors in the most important place possible--their wallets.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of the 44th anniversary of Tunisian independence. On March 20, Tunisia--one of America's oldest allies--will mark its 44th year of independence, but our two nations have been sharing the ideals of freedom and democracy for a much longer time. 
   In 1797, our two nations signed a treaty calling for ``perpetual and constant peace.'' Indeed, for the past 200 years, our two nations have enjoyed such a friendship. Whether protecting Mediterranean shipping lanes against Barbary pirates, opposing the Nazi war machine in North Africa, or supporting Western interests during the cold war, the United States could count on Tunisia. More recently, Tunisia displayed great courage in urging other Arab nations to seek an accord with Israel. Tunisia has built on that pioneering stand by playing an important role as an honest and fair broker at delicate points in the Middle East peace process. 
   By adopting progressive social policies that feature tolerance for minorities, equal rights for women, universal education, a modern health system, and avoiding the pitfall of religious extremism that has tormented so many other developing countries. Tunisia has built a stable, middle-class society. In stark contrast to its two neighbors, Tunisia has been a quiet and wonderful success. In fact, Tunisia became the first nation south of the Mediterranean to formally associate itself with the European Union. 
   Tunisia has been a model for developing countries. It has sustained remarkable economic growth, and undertaken reforms toward political pluralism. It has been a steadfast ally of the United States and has consistently fought for democratic goals and ideals. Tunisia has responded to President Dwight D. Eisenhower's request to consider the United States as ``friends and partner'' in the most effective way--by its actions. 
   In commemoration of 44 years of independence for Tunisia, I urge my colleagues to reflect on our strong commitment to Tunisian people, who are still our friends and partners in North Africa.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr. John J. Lessner, resident of Lapeer, MI, who on March 10th of this year celebrated his 100th birthday. It is my pleasure to honor him not only for having reached this landmark birthday, which is quite an accomplishment in itself, but also, and I think more importantly, for having lived his life in a manner truly worthy of commendation. 
   One of Mr. Lessner's favorite sayings is ``Work-a-Million,'' and he has certainly lived by this virtue. For thirty-nine years he worked as a high-school teacher and coach, for thirty-seven years a football and basketball official, he sold world-book encyclopedias for twenty-four years, worked at the H.C. Frick Coal Mine and Monogahela Railroad for fifteen summers, spent nine years working towards his M.A. in Education, which he received from West Virginia University in 1953, spent six years constructing a home for his family and himself, spent three years playing fullback for the Brownsville (PA) Independence Football Team, and all this after he began his adult life by serving his country for a year in the U.S. Army. 
   On top of all this, Mr. Lessner, somehow found the time to be not only an active community member, but a community leader. He helped organize and develop two Parent Teacher Associations, in Greene County, PA, and Washington County, PA. He served as the first, twelfth and twenty-fifth president of the Greensboro Lions Club in Greensboro, PA. During World War II, he served as the Air Raid Warden for Brownsville, PA. And every Sunday, for eighteen years, he volunteered his time as a Sunday School Superintendent at Christian Church in Brownsville, PA, and then later at Mapletown Methodist Church in Mapleton, PA. 
   Most important to Mr. Lessner, though, has always been his family. He now resides in Lapeer, MI, with his son Jack, the eldest of his two children. He moved to Lapeer from Monroeville, PA, where he lived near his daughter, Maryjane. And undoubtedly one of his greatest days came on December 27, 1979, when he and his wife, Doris Steeves, celebrated their fiftieth wedding anniversary. 
   This may be selfish on my part, but as I read the biography of Mr. Lessner, my only wish was that he had spent more of his one-hundred years in Michigan. His is a brand of remarkable that, unfortunately, you do not run into everyday. Regardless, John J. Lessner is a true role model, and we are glad to have him now. So, on behalf not only of myself but also of all my Michigan constituents, I would like to wish Mr. Lessner a happy 100th birthday, and I hope that there are many more to celebrate in the future.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, a few weeks ago Senator HATCH, Senator NICKLES, and I, along with other Senators, introduced S. 2042, the Pardon Attorney Reform and Integrity Act. The Judiciary Committee has now reported this legislation to the floor. I wanted to say just a few words about why I believe this legislation is needed and why I hope the Senate will act quickly. 
   Last September, President Clinton decided to grant clemency to 11 members of the Puerto Rican terrorist groups FALN and Los Macheteros. When this decision became known, it was greeted with virtually universal shock and disbelief, followed by calls for the President to reconsider and ultimately by near universal condemnation. The FALN had been involved in numerous terrorist acts. The most heinous of these acts was the bombing of Fraunces Tavern in New York City. In the middle of the lunch time rush at this Wall Street tavern, FALN members planted a bomb. The explosion killed four people and left 55 people wounded. In addition, FALN has taken credit for more than 130 bombings, attempted bombings, bomb threats and kidnapings. They took credit for the bombing of office buildings in New York and Chicago where at least one other person was killed and several more injured. 
   Although it has been suggested that the individuals the President pardoned were not convicted of direct involvement in these acts, the conduct that they were convicted of made clear that they all played important roles in facilitating the activities of the organization, fully aware that the entity in question engaged in just this kind of conduct. Despite this, there is no evidence that any of them are seriously remorseful about their serious wrongdoing. Singling them out for the extraordinary favor of Presidential clemency is, under these circumstances, frankly inexplicable. 
   Both this body and the House of Representatives passed resolutions stating our disapproval of the President's action. Following these events, the Committee on the Judiciary held two hearings on how the President had made his decision. In the first of these hearings, it was discovered that Reverend Ikuta, a supporter of clemency for the terrorists, had several meetings with the Department of Justice concerning the potential grant of clemency. At the same time, law enforcement officials, who attempted to contact the President and the Department of Justice concerning the clemency, received no response from the administration. Nor were the victims consulted in any way. The son of one of the victims of the Fraunces Tavern bombing was told in 1998 by the FBI that they were still searching for the FALN member thought to have planted the bomb. Meanwhile, the President was considering granting clemency to individuals who not only were members of the group responsible for the bomb in the first place, but also who may have had information about the whereabouts of this primary suspect. The victims of the terrorists' acts were never even informed of the President's grant of clemency. They had to read it in the newspaper. Perhaps the gravest oversight of all is that the terrorists were never asked to provide any information about other FALN members who are still on the FBI most wanted list. 
   The goal of this bill is to try to do what Congress can to prevent this situation from recurring. The bill would require the Department of Justice, if asked to investigate a pardon request, to make all reasonable efforts to inform the victims that a pardon request is being reviewed and give the victims an opportunity to present their views. The Department is also required to notify the victims of a decision to grant clemency as soon as practical after it is made and, if it will result in the release of someone, before release of that person if practicable. The bill also requires that the Department of Justice make all reasonable efforts to determine the views of law enforcement on whether the person has accepted responsibility for his or her actions and 
   whether the person is a danger to any person or society. Finally the Department must determine from federal, state and local law enforcement whether the person may have information relevant to any ongoing investigation, prosecution, or effort to apprehend a fugitive, and to determine the effect of a grant of clemency on the threat of terrorism or future criminal activity. 
   Opponents of this bill argue that it is an unconstitutional infringement on the Presidential pardon power. This is not so. This bill dictates a process to be used when the President delegates investigatory power to the Department of Justice. Accordingly, this bill is not a usurpation of the President's pardon power, but within the legitimate exercise of Congress's power, in establishing the Department of Justice, to ``make all laws which are necessary and proper for carrying into Execution'' not only the powers vested in Congress but also ``all other powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.'' The President's own freedom to exercise the pardon power however he sees fit is in no way infringed by this bill. In fact, this bill only acts to ensure that the President has the information before  him to make a well rounded and informed decision. The President can ignore the information provided by the victims and the law enforcement officers if he chooses to do so. I would hope that he would not. But while requirements that would force him to give particular weight to their views would most likely be unconstitutional, requiring the Department to make this information available to him, for whatever use he chooses to make of it, surely is not. Indeed, the President and the Department of Justice should be supportive of this bill as it should help return to the American people confidence in the clemency process that may have been lost following the release of the FALN and Los Macheteros terrorists. 
   It is unconscionable that in this instance, the views of the victims and law enforcement officers, the parties most affected by both the criminal act and the clemency, were ignored in the decision making process. This bill goes a long way in helping to prevent a recurrence of the defects in process in President Clinton's grant of clemency last September to the 11 terrorists. It will enhance the quality of information available so as to ensure a more balanced basis for the President's decisions regarding clemency. I am, therefore, pleased the committee has reported this legislation to the floor of the Senate, and I urge its prompt enactment.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. If the majority leader will yield briefly, I thank him for making another attempt to appoint conferees on this legislation. 
   Mr. President, I share the majority leader's frustration over our inability to really move anywhere with this bill. This bill, the Millennium Digital Commerce Act, is a bipartisan bill. This legislation passed the Senate by unanimous consent. We worked together here to try to craft the legislation in a bipartisan fashion. The House companion legislation passed by an overwhelming margin. 
   I understand--and the majority leader has just indicated it again--there may be some Members who have concerns with the bill. But, obviously, going to conference is the usual procedure for moving legislation. As I understand the request that has been put forward, there would be six Democratic Senators on the conference committee, which is about 15 percent of the entire Senate Democratic caucus who would then be able to participate in the proposal.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Essentially, the legislation is designed to address a problem we have now with respect to the  enforceability of contracts that are entered into electronically. A number of States have attempted to deal with this. This would be where parties, over the Internet, engage in some form of contractual activity. A number of States have passed legislation--in fact, about 45 States have done so. The problem is that each of these State laws is different from the other. As a result of that, it has created a serious potential impediment to the expansion of electronic commerce because if the laws of two different jurisdictions are different, somebody can hide behind that difference to argue that they did not have to fulfill the terms of the contract. 
   Fortunately, the States are trying to work toward a solution, as they have done in other areas of commercial activity. We have a Uniform Commercial Code, and the States are trying to work together to address these kinds of interstate contracts. That will take time. Even after they come to final agreement on a specific format or formula for the legislation, it is going to take probably years for all the States to adopt it. So this would guarantee the enforceability of contracts entered into electronically in the interim. That is the approach we have taken, and we hope it will therefore allow continuing growth in the area of electronic commerce, which is, as you well know, becoming one of the key sectors and key activities in our economy today.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. I don't, for the very simple reason that in the House, the House-passed legislation went beyond the scope of what we passed in the Senate to include legislation, or to expand the use of this legislation to transactions that involved securities and other transactions which would fall under our Banking Committee's jurisdiction. Had those been in the initial legislation we introduced here, then the jurisdiction of this bill in the Senate might have been altered or in some way divided. 
   For that reason, I think there is a very valid argument for the Banking Committee, because of the broader nature of the legislation that came to the House, to participate in the conference.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, point of clarification: In the process of the appointment of conferees, obviously each Chamber has to appoint them based on the respective jurisdictions of the parts of this bill that are before us; that is, the House bill as it finished the House and the Senate bill as it finished the Senate. Although I don't have an intricate knowledge of the jurisdictions of various areas in the House, it is my understanding that matters that pertain to the SEC and securities-related issues in the House fall under the Commerce Committee's jurisdiction, whereas in the Senate they fall under the Banking Committee's jurisdiction. 
   I think that may explain the problem a little bit because in the House it is perfectly reasonable and appropriate that the Commerce Committee alone be represented. They have jurisdiction over those provisions that are securities-related as well as those that are related to the technology side of this. In the Senate, that is not the case. Our Banking Committee, not the Commerce Committee, has responsibility for those areas. I think that is part of the problem.

   I reiterate, had the bill that the House passed been the bill that was introduced here, clearly the jurisdiction on the Senate side would have been differently arranged in some fashion. I don't know if it is called sequential jurisdiction or what, but provisions would have fallen under the Banking Committee's domain.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on March 18 of this year, at the Lithuanian Cultural Center, in Southfield, Michigan, Lithuanian Americans will gather to mark the tenth anniversary of the reestablishment of Lithuanian independence. 
   Michigan's Lithuanian-American community also will celebrate the perseverance and sacrifice of their people, which enabled them to achieve the freedom they now enjoy. 
   I have reviewed the bare facts before: On March 11, 1990, the newly elected Lithuanian Parliament, fulfilling its electoral mandate from the people of Lithuania, declared the restoration of Lithuania's independence and the establishment of a democratic state. This marked a great moment for Lithuania  and for lovers of freedom around the globe. 
   The people of Lithuania endured 51 years of oppressive foreign occupation. Operating under cover of the infamous Hitler-Stalin Pact of 1939, Soviet troops marched into Lithuania, beginning an occupation characterized by communist dictatorship and cultural genocide. 
   Even in the face of this oppression, the Lithuanian people were not defeated. The resisted their oppressors and kept their culture, their faith and their dream of independence very much alive even during the hardest times. 
   The people of Lithuania were even able to mobilize and sustain a non-violent movement for social and political change, a movement which came to be known as Sajudis. This people's movement helped guarantee a peaceful transition to independence through full participation in democratic elections on February 24, 1990. 
   Unfortunately, as is so often the case, peace and freedom had to be purchased again and again. In January of 1991, ten months after restoration of independence, the people and government of Lithuania faced a bloody assault by foreign troops intent on overthrowing their democratic institutions. Lithuanians withstood this assault, maintaining their independence and their democracy. Their successful use of non-violent resistance to an oppressive regime is an inspiration to all. 
   Lithuania's integration into the international community has been swift and sure. On September 17, 1991, the reborn nation became a member of the United Nations and is a signatory to a number of its organizations and other international agreements. It also is a member of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and the Council of Europe. 
   Lithuania is an associate member of the European Union, has applied for NATO membership and is currently negotiating for membership in the WTO, OECD and other Western organizations. 
   The United States established diplomatic relations with Lithuania on July 28, 1992. But our nation never really broke with the government and people of Lithuania. The United States never recognized the forcible incorporation of Lithuania into the U.S.S.R., and views the present Government of Lithuania as a legal continuation of the inter-war republic. Indeed, for over fifty years the United States maintained a bipartisan consensus that our nation would refuse to recognize the forcible incorporation of Lithuania into the former Soviet Union. 
   America's relations with Lithuania continue to be strong, friendly and mutually beneficial. Lithuania has enjoyed most-favored-nation (MFN) treatment with the United States since December, 1991. Through 1996, the United States has committed over $100 million to Lithuania's economic and political transformation and to address humanitarian needs. In 1994, the United States and Lithuania signed an agreement of bilateral trade and intellectual property protection, and in 1997 a bilateral investment treaty. 
   In 1998 the United States and Lithuania signed the Baltic Charter Partnership. That charter recalls the history of American relations with the area and underscores our ``real, profound, and enduring'' interest in the security and independence of the three Baltic states. As the Charter also notes, our interest in a Europe whole and free will not be ensured until Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are secure. 
   I commend the people of Lithuania for their courage and perseverance in using peaceful means to regain their independence. I pledge to work with my colleagues to continue working to secure the freedom and independence of Lithuania and its Baltic neighbors, and I join with the people of Lithuania as they celebrate their independence.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to remember Jeff Clevenger, a dear friend who died on December 21, 1999. The illness which led to his death came suddenly and Jeff was taken from us all too soon. 
   Jeff Clevenger was a great American in that he gave everything of himself to make his community and this country great. He contributed to our economy as Vice President and General Manager of the Wickes Machine Tool Group, Inc., in Saginaw, Michigan. In 1983 he led a team of managers in the buyout of the machine tool group from Wickes. The new company was named SMS Group, Inc. From the formation of this new company until his death, Jeff served as President, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer of SMS Group, Inc. 
   Jeff contributed to his community unselfishly. And he was not satisfied to simply be a member of a club or board. In nearly every organization he joined, at some point, Jeff served as chairman. These organizations include: the Saginaw Chamber of Commerce; the Michigan State Chamber of Commerce; the Michigan Manufacturers Association; Saginaw Remanufacturing; Junior Achievement; the Government Relations Committee of the Association for Manufacturing Technology; United Way of Saginaw County; the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Association. In 1994 he became the founding Chairman of the United Way Alexis de Toqueville Society in Saginaw County. Jeff also served as a board member for Saginaw Future, Inc., and the Delta College Foundation. He also devoted his time to Saginaw Valley State University. 
   Jeff's dedication to his community did not go unnoticed. He has received a number of honors. He was given the ``Spirit of Saginaw'' award; the ``Entrepreneur of the Year'' award; the Junior Achievement Hall of Fame Award; the Robert H. Albert Award for Community Service from the Saginaw Chamber of Commerce; to name a few. 
   The State of Michigan is a better place because we were lucky enough to have Jeff Clevenger as part of our community. Even those who did not know Jeff will benefit for many years from his dedication to his community. And to those who did know him, myself included, Jeff's life will forever serve as an inspiration. 
   I would like at this time, on behalf of the United States Senate, to extend my sympathies to Jeff's family: Nell Clevenger, Lori Himes, Robin Vosen, Allana Clevenger, Angela Jennings, and Bradley Weaver. Your loss is shared by many.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I voted for both the Coverdell and Boxer sense of the Senate amendments relating to school safety. I voted for both amendments because I believe that Congress can and should enact legislation to provide for safer schools and a secure learning environment. The language of Senator BOXER's Sense of the Senate stated that ``Congress shall make schools safe for learning by implementing policies that will reduce the threat of gun violence in schools''; I rise now to briefly explain a few of the wholly-attainable measures that I believe would truly make a difference. 
   During the Juvenile Justice debate I offered a commonsense amendment that would allow local school districts to access existing funds available under the Safe and Drug Free Schools Act to conduct locker searches for guns, explosives, other weapons, or drugs. Mr. President, no one involved opposes cleansing our schools of these elements, other than those criminals who possess them; and to those few, I have no sympathy for any inconvenience these searches may cause. I am pleased that my colleagues supported my amendment, which was accepted by voice vote. 
   I also suggest that Congress should build upon a current tax deduction and reward businesses that donate school safety devices to K-12 schools. Qualified security equipment and technologies should include metal detectors, electronic locks and surveillance cameras. 
   Along with these security improvements, I believe it is important to provide training for school personnel and parents on how to recognize a troubled young person before tragedy strikes. And in the event of an attack, our school officials, security personnel, parents and communities must be trained for emergency preparedness and crisis response. 
   In that vein, I argue to my colleagues that we should allow ESEA funding available under the Safe & Drug Free Schools and Communities program and the Innovative Education Program to be used for innovative approaches to reducing violence in schools and improving the classroom environment. Among other uses of such funding could be the testing of students for illegal drug use, at the request or consent of a parent or legal guardian; comprehensive school security assessments; purchase of school security equipment and technologies; implementation of a school uniform policy; and collaborative efforts with groups demonstrating expertise in providing research-based violence prevention and intervention programs. 
   But the most important quality of these initiatives is that they would be initiated at the local level by those with the most knowledge of the community, not by some nameless Washington bureaucrat wielding a ``one-size-fits-all'' solution. 
   Finally, I was pleased to have the opportunity to vote for Senator DURBIN's amendment, which harkens back to a day when this country discussed issues of responsibility and society in a constructive manner, not in one based in fear or fantasy. Without question, we should educate our young people on right and wrong, and we must encourage constructive adult involvement in the lives of our young people, not only by parents and teachers, but also by community-based organizations, faith-based organizations, and local law enforcement personnel. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise, with sadness and a heavy heart today. On Tuesday, Kayla Rolland, a 6-year-old first grader was shot and killed by a classmate at Theo J. Buell Elementary School in Mount Morris Township, MI. 
   As Kayla's family mourns their lost, I am certain in my heart that Kayla's spirit is in a better place. 
   It is my hope that in this difficult time Kayla's family will find comfort in one another, in their community, in their faith and in the knowledge that across America their fellow citizens feel their grief. 
   Such a violent death is a great tragedy. But for someone so young, to have her hopes and dreams cut short by gunfire--stretches the limits of our power to understand and to accept. 
   As the father of two daughters, also in the first grade, I can't get out of my mind the pictures of Buell Elementary School, as so many frightened young children facing a terror few of us would want to know firsthand, rushed into the arms of their parents. 
   I thank God each day that my kids return home safe, away from the dangers of this world and from the senseless violence that haunts our communities. 
   But, as our Nation tries to address the questions and issues that surrounded this tragic event, I hope that, for the next few days, we focus on Kayla's family. 
   A family lost a child this week, and that we must not forget. 
   There is a time and a place to address the circumstances surrounding Kayla's death and the public policy issues involved, and I look forward to those discussions. 
   But, I hope that we will not allow the policy debates and the media rush to examine this tragic event cause us to forget the immediate needs of a family in mourning. 
   Above all, I hope that we will keep the Rolland family and Kayla in our thoughts and prayers. 
   In closing, Mr. President, on behalf of my wife Jane and myself, I would like to express our family's deepest sympathies to the Rolland family.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Senior Citizens' Financial Freedom Act, a bill which would accomplish three objectives. First, it rolls back the Clinton Administration's 1993 tax increase on Social Security benefits. Second, it repeals the Social Security Earnings Test working penalty on Seniors. Finally, it returns to our Seniors the ability to control their own savings, by increasing the age when minimum IRA distributions must begin, from 70 1/2 to 85. 
   Mr. President, our tax code mercilessly penalizes Seniors. In fact, Seniors are double taxed. First the government takes money from their paycheck to pay for the Social Security system. Then, when the senior receives their benefits, they are taxed again. The Government also penalizes Seniors for working by placing an ``Earnings Test'' just to receive Social Security benefits. Finally, the Government forces Seniors to withdraw benefits from their IRAs, whether they want to or not, and penalizes them with a 50% tax if they do not. 
   This is immoral, illogical and simply wrong. 
   Mr. President, I applaud our colleagues in the House for passing a bill to eliminate the Social Security Earnings Test, which takes away Social Security benefits simply because a 60 year old works. We should be celebrating those between 60 and 70 years old who can work, but instead, we punish them. For a Senior between 60 and 65, if they earn over $9,600 in income beyond Social Security benefits (which is just above the poverty level), they lose 50% of their benefits. For those between 65 and 70 years old, they lose 33% of their benefits for earning over $15,500. It's not until they turn 70 can they both work and keep their benefits. This represents a marginal tax rate for someone under 65 of almost 60%. While I agree that the Earnings Test must be eliminated, Congress should go beyond this. 
   In 1993, President Clinton proposed, and the Democratic-controlled Congress passed by one vote, a 70% increase on Social Security benefits. These benefits should not be taxed at all, but the fact that they were raised so much gives us the opportunity, during these large surpluses, to provide immediate relief for our Seniors. When coupled with the Earnings Test, these two taxes can result in some couples suffering under a 103% marginal tax rate. Seniors could lose more than a dollar for making another dollar. 
   Finally, Mr. President, we must amend the IRA distribution requirements. When a person reaches 70 1/2 years old, the Government forces them to begin taking out money from their IRA, which they personally have saved up for it's their money. They have to  take all of it out of their account within their life expectancy at the time they start making withdrawals, which for someone 70 1/2 , is currently about 15 years. They must make these withdrawals whether they need to do so or not. And if they do not take out the money, or cannot because they're invested in long-term projects, they lose 50% of the money to punitive taxes. Essentially, they are penalized for their foresight in saving for retirement, and their industry for finding other sources of income than these retirement assets. Mr. President, this is a policy that only the federal government could think up, and it comes from the bureaucratic mentality that says the people's money belongs to the government, and not the people. What is particularly worrisome, is that although the current rules assume someone 70 1/2 has a life expectancy of 15 years, people are living longer and retiring later, and these rules could result in individuals not having the money available when they really do need it. 
   Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support reducing the tax burden on Seniors, to give those Seniors who want to work the freedom to work, without the fear of penalty and to restore their control over their savings. In short, I ask my colleagues to restore to Seniors their financial freedom.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I comment to my colleague from Nevada, I appreciate the interest and support and efforts of all the Members he mentioned and those who previously were supporters of this legislation when it was introduced as a freestanding bill. I hope very much to ultimately succeed in bringing this legislation to final successful completion. 
   First, prior to a discussion on the amendment, I express my strong support for the Affordable Education Act and compliment Senator COVERDELL for his hard work on this effort. At a time when the new high-tech economy demands greater skills from our workers, our educational system is failing in its duty to provide enough of these skills. 
   At a time when the Department of Labor figures project our economy will produce more than 1.3 million information technology jobs over the next 10 years, our universities will produce, at least at the current pace, less than one-quarter of that number of graduates in related fields. 
   At a time when we enjoy a critical competitive edge in high tech, we are not giving our own children the skills they need to succeed in the high-tech economy, at least not, in my judgment, at an adequate level. We need to address that, and this amendment, in a small way, attempts to do so. 
   One crucial problem concerns the skyrocketing cost of education. According to the College Board, the average annual cost for tuition, room, and board at a public university is now $7,472. At a private college, it is a whopping $19,213 per year. 
   If costs continue rising as they have been, a 4-year college education will cost $75,000 at a public university and $250,000 at a private college by the time the average newborn begins attending in the year 2016. 
   The Affordable Education Act addresses this problem through practical, pragmatic reforms. I will not detail all of those at this time. Obviously, the proponents of the legislation have been doing an excellent job of outlining what this bill accomplishes. 
   I firmly believe the continuing growth and prosperity in America depends on continuing affordability of higher education. It is my firm belief we must do more, particularly in the area of closing what is regularly referenced as the digital divide between the digital haves and the digital have-nots.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on July 29 of last year, the Senate unanimously adopted this amendment to the tax reduction bill. I urge the Senate to do so again today. 
   This amendment aims to address our shortage of skilled high-tech workers by addressing the shortage of computers and computer training in our schools. 
   Advanced technology has fueled unprecedented economic growth and transformed the way Americans do business and communicate with each other. 
   Despite these gains, however, this same technology is just beginning to have an impact on our classrooms and how we educate our children. Thirty-two percent of our public schools have only one classroom with access to the Internet. 
   It is imperative that we act now to provide our Nation's students with the training they need to succeed in tomorrow's high-tech workplace. 
   The Department of Education recommends there be at least one computer for every five students. According to the Education Testing Service, in 1997 there was only one computer for every 24 students on average. Not only are our classrooms sadly underequipped, but the equipment they have is often obsolete, often incapable, for example, of accessing the Internet. 
   One of the more common computers in our schools today is the Apple IIc, a computer so archaic that it is now on display at the Smithsonian. 
   While this technological deficiency affects all of our schools, the students who are in the most need are receiving the least amount of computer instruction and exposure. According to the Secretary of Education, 75.9 percent of households with an annual income over $75,000 have computers, compared to only 11 percent of households with incomes under $10,000. 
   This disparity exists when comparing households with the Internet access as well. While 42 percent of families with annual incomes over $75,000 have online capability, only 10 percent of families with incomes of $25,000 or less have the same capability. 
   Rural areas and inner cities fall below the national average for households that have computers. Nationwide, 40.8 percent of white households have computers, while only 19 percent of African American and Hispanic households do. This disparity, unfortunately, is increasing, not decreasing. This unfortunate trend is not confined simply to individual households; it is present in our schools as well. 
   The Educational Testing Service statistics show schools with 81 percent or more economically disadvantaged students have only one multimedia computer for every 32 students, while a school with 20 percent or fewer economically disadvantaged students will have a multimedia computer for every 22 students. 
   That is a difference of 10 students per computer. Furthermore, schools with 90 percent or more minority students have only one multimedia computer for every 30 students. This is simply unacceptable. 
   It points up the importance of securing additional computers for use in our schools. Our schools should be great educational equalizers, providing resources and training to everyone, regardless of their race, class, or rural or urban location so all of our kids can succeed. 
   To achieve this end, our amendment expands the parameters of the existing tax deduction for computer deductions. It will also add a tax credit. 
   Specifically, it will do the following: First, it will allow a tax credit equal to 30 percent of the fair market value of the donated computer equipment. An increased tax credit provides a greater incentive for companies to donate computer technology and equipment to schools. This includes computers, peripheral equipment, software, and fiber optic cable related to computer use. 
   Second, it will expand the current age limit on donated computers to include equipment 3 years old or less. Many companies do not update their equipment within the existing 2-year period that currently is required for qualification for the existing tax deductions. 
   Yet 3-year-old computers equipped with Pentium-based or equivalent chips have the processing power, memory, and graphics capabilities to provide sufficient Internet and multimedia access and run any necessary software. 
   Third, the current limitation on original use will be expanded to include original equipment manufacturers or any corporation that reacquires the equipment. 
   By expanding the number of donors eligible for the tax credit, the number of computers available will increase as well.  
   Lastly, it would implement enhanced tax credits equal to 50 percent of the fair market value of equipment donated to schools located within designated empowerment zones, enterprise communities, and Indian reservations. 
   Doubling the amount of the tax credits for donations made to schools in economically distressed areas will increase the availability of computers to the children who need it most. 
   Bringing our classrooms into the 21st century will require a major national investment. 
   According to a Rand Institute study, it will cost $15 billion, or $300 per student, to provide American schools with the technology needed to educate our young people; the primary cost being the purchase and installation of computer equipment. 
   At a time when the Government is planning to spend $2.25 billion to wire schools and libraries to the Internet, the demand for this sophisticated hardware will be even greater. 
   Meanwhile, the Detwiler Foundation estimates that if just 10 percent of the computers that are taken out of service each year were donated to schools, the national ratio of students-to-computers would be brought to 5 to 1 or less. This would meet, or even exceed, the ratio recommended by the Department of Education. 
   This amendment will provide powerful tax incentives for American businesses to donate top quality high-tech equipment to our Nation's classrooms. And it will do so without unduly increasing Federal Government expenditures or creating yet another Federal program or department. 
   Encouraging private investment and involvement, this act will keep control where it belongs--with the teachers, the parents, and the students. 
   At the same time, all our children will have an equal chance at succeeding in the new technological millennium. 
   In my mind, these are laudable goals, goals we must attain if we are going to provide the kind of future our children deserve. 
   In closing, I am hopeful our colleagues will uniformly join in support of this legislation. It seems to me, as I travel around my State and go into classrooms, there are a lot of places in Michigan--and I suspect in all the other States--where just a little bit more equipment would allow for more students to get the kind of high-tech training they need. 
   How do we match up a situation where, literally across this country, we have schools that do not have enough computer equipment, and we have countless businesses and enterprises that have used equipment they don't know what to do with? Can't we find a way? In my judgment, this legislation is the way. 
   If we pass this legislation, I think we will provide a major incentive to merge the used surplus computers that exist in the private sector with the needs of our schools. In doing so, we will provide more students with access to the technology they need to have in order to be able to pursue the jobs of the new century. 
   I offer this amendment for my colleagues' consideration. I appreciate the attention of the Chamber. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, very briefly, this amendment would essentially expand the tax deductibility and create a tax credit for the donation of used computer equipment to schools in this country. 
   It enjoys strong bipartisan support, both in the freestanding bill as well as this amendment. What this will help us to do is address the problem of the digital divide by providing more hardware and software and other computer services and equipment to the public schools of this country to help improve the ratio of computers to students in our public school system. 
   We look forward to continuing to work on this digital divide challenge, but this legislation will move us in the right direction. I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the men and women of our U.S. Coast Guard. In particular, I salute the crew of the USCGC Mackinaw for their work, which ensures the full utilization of the navigation season in my state, and the Great Lakes region as a whole. 
   Mr. President, the ice that forms on the Great Lakes rivals that found anywhere in the continental United States. Even in a normal winter, ice six to eight feet thick will develop in the connecting channels. Windrows, chunks of ice piled atop one another by the wind, easily can reach 15 feet in height. Navigation under such conditions has been possible only because the Coast Guard's icebreaking forces are led by the Mackinaw. The icebreaker is capable of generating 10,000 shaft horsepower, and is wide enough--75 feet--to clear a track for Great Lakes vessels. Furthermore, the Mackinaw is crewed sufficiently to stay on station for days on end. 
   Annually, more than 10 million tons of iron ore, 4 million tons of coal, 1.5 million tons of stone, and 500,000 tons of cement are shipped across the Great Lakes. The iron ore, coal, stone, and Seaway trades generated nearly 14 billion tons of cargo during the 20th century. That commerce could not have been accomplished as safely and efficiently as it was without the assistance of the U.S. Coast Guard, and especially, the Mackinaw.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in sponsoring, S. 2003, the Keep Our Promise to America's Military Retirees Act of 2000. I am sponsoring this legislation because I believe it is necessary if we are to fulfill our moral obligation to those who devoted their careers to safeguarding our nation's people, our homes, and our way of life. 
   The brave men and women of our armed forces literally put their lives on the line for this country. We owe them a debt we can never repay. But one thing we cannot do, in my opinion, is fail to live up to our explicit promise that those who made military life their career would receive, in return lifetime medical care. That is a promise we have made; and it is a promise we must keep. 
   There has already been a great deal of discussion on this topic in the Administration and the Congress. In the 1998 National Defense Authorization Act, Congress expressed its sense that many retired military personnel reasonably believed that they had been promised lifetime health care in exchange for 20 or more years of service. Recruiters for the uniformed services, as agents of the United States government, had used recruiting tactics promising enrollees entering the Armed Forces prior to June 7, 1956, that they would be entitled to fully paid lifetime health care upon retirement. 
   Unfortunately, prior to 1956, a statutory health care plan did not exist for our military personnel. Since the establishment of CHAMPUS, and its successor, Tricare, we have seen the erosion of space-available health care at military treatment facilities for military retirees. Additionally, military health care has become increasingly difficult to obtain for military retirees as the Department of Defense reduces its health care infrastructure. As a result, military retiree's health care situation is woefully inadequate compared to health care afforded to other federal employees. Today, military retirees remain the only Federal Government personnel who have been prevented from using their employer-provided health care at or after 65 years of age. Military retirees deserve to have a health care program that is at least comparable with that of retirees from civilian employment in the Federal Government. 
   In statements before this Congress, our distinguished Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs have reiterated the importance of seeing to military retirees' health needs. According to Secretary Cohen, the loudest complaints he hears while traveling concern the military health care system. 
   I believe General Hugh Shelton expressed the correct response to these complaints when he stated, ``I think that the first thing we need to do is make sure that we acknowledge our commitment to the retirees for their years of service and for what we basically committed to at the time they were recruited into the armed forces.'' 
   It is morally imperative, that we keep our promise to the brave men and women who devoted their careers to protecting our country. 
   But we should also keep in mind that health care is not only a top issue for retirees; it is also a major source of dissatisfaction for active duty personnel. As such it affects readiness, recruiting and retention. The availability of quality, lifetime health care is a critical recruiting incentive for the all volunteer Armed Forces. 
   That incentive has been undermined by the declining services provided to military retirees. In its self-proclaimed ``Year of Health Care,'' the Department of Defense had a major opportunity to 
    take the lead in keeping commitments to service members and start erasing the skepticism and distrust that years of broken health care promises have engendered among the retired population. Putting these initiatives in the  President's budget would have made them much easier to enact. But, once again, the Administration has chosen to pass its moral responsibilities to the Congress. 
   For too long, this Administration has ignored the needs of the brave men and women who have defended our interests and our shores. This is unfair. What is more, in my view it is unwise to ignore the well-being of military retirees. 
   Well-trained, properly motivated troops have been and continue to be the single most important factor in protecting our national security. Without them we will not be able to achieve and maintain military readiness. We will not be able, as a nation, to fight and win. Under current conditions we cannot expect to maintain the levels of re-enlistment, expertise and morale we need to maintain an effective military force. 
   Last year this Congress took it upon itself to address the critical issue of unconscionably low military pay. I hope and believe that this year we will address the no-less critical issue of unconscionably inadequate health care services for military retirees. 
   This Congress and the President must take action to address the problems associated with the availability of health care for military retirees. Keeping this nation's promise and providing adequate health care for military retirees is an issue whose time has come. Every day, in hundreds of locations all over the world, our soldiers, sailors and airmen willingly serve in defense of our national interest, promoting peace and prosperity around the globe. 
   We have asked for the greatest sacrifice from our military retirees and today's men and women in uniform--to give one's life in defense of their nation. When people put themselves in harm's way for their country, they should not have to worry about their families' access to proper health care. 
   We must act upon the sense of this Congress that the United States has incurred a moral obligation to provide health care to former members of the Armed Forces who are entitled to retired or retainer pay (or its equivalent); and it is, therefore, necessary to provide quality, affordable health to such retirees. 
   For these reasons I am happy to join with Senators COVERDELL, JOHNSON, and 13 fellow Senators in co-sponsoring the bipartisan Keep Our Promise to America's Military Retirees Act (S..2003). This legislation is key to re-establishing the morale, confidence and trust of our military retirees. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and to salute our Nation's Veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs has designated the week of February 13-19 as ``National Salute to Hospitalized Veterans Week.'' I take this opportunity to pay special tribute to those veterans who are currently hospitalized, especially those hospitalized in the Battle Creek, MI, VA Medical Center. 
   These brave people served their country in time of need. Many of them were wounded. Many of them knew others who never came home from battle. It is only right, then, that our nation help them in time of physical need. 
   The Battle Creek VA Medical Center provides an excellent example of how our nation can repay some of the debt it owes our brave veterans. This facility has provided quality care for up to 325 residents at a time for over 75 years. It is an important part of our system of 172 VA Medical Centers across the United States, and an important part of the Battle Creek community. 
   I know that a festive schedule of special events has been planned for the week long salute. Our veterans, and particularly those who are currently hospitalized, certainly deserve every tribute we can give to them. And the same goes for the dedicated men and women who care for them. 
   The American people will be forever indebted to our veterans and their families. Without their sacrifice, dedication, and unwavering commitment to our nation and its ideals, America would not be the beacon of freedom it is today. I ask that you and my colleagues join me in saluting the veterans at the Battle Creek VA Medical Center and each and every individual who has served with distinction in the U.S. Armed Forces. Let us say to them: We salute you and we thank you.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the proud achievements of the 110th Fighter Wing of the Air National Guard. This group was recently awarded the prestigious United States Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for meritorious service, an award given to only three Air National Guard fighter wings. I would like to take this opportunity to share the history of success of this unit. 
   The 110th Fighter Wing has served America courageously around the world. Recently, the unit conducted flight operations from Aviano Air Base, Italy, in support of Operation Joint Guard over Bosnia-Herzegovina. During this period, the unit received a grade of ``Outstanding''--an honor reserved for only the elite forces in the U.S. Armed Services--for an Operational Readiness Inspection. This distinction was the first ever given to a Michigan-based unit. 
   Mr. President, I would also like to recognize the service of Col. Ken Heaton, USAF, the unit's commander. Under Colonel Heaton's command, the 110th Fighter Wing has continued its history of excellence with these most recent awards. In the unit's 52-year history, it has been awarded the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award four times. 
   I am proud to have the opportunity to share the accomplishments of the 110th Fighter Wing on the floor of the U.S. Senate.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to recognize Beulah Cool and congratulate her on the celebration of her 96th birthday. Ms. Cool was born on June 20, 1903 in Elmdale, MI, and is currently a resident of Webberville County, MI. 
   Ms. Cool has lived a life dedicated to helping others, as evidenced by her commitment to education and community service. She graduated from Clarksville school in 1921, took a six-week course in teaching, and taught at a rural school that same year. Upon her marriage to Kenneth Cool in 1929, she put a hold on her teaching career and gave birth to two sons, William Kenneth (1940) and Robert Arthur (1943), staying at home until they were both in school. In 1950, Ms. Cool returned to teaching, instructing first grade for 21 years until her retirement in 1971. 
   After her retirement from teaching, Beulah commenced her ``second career'' as a volunteer, with organizations such as the Red Cross, CROP Walk and Sparrow Hospital. One of her specialities when working at Sparrow was knitting caps for premature babies. Ms. Cool is also a member of the Webberville United Methodist Church (where she has taught Sunday School), the Webberville Women's Advance Club, the Webberville Garden Club, and the Webberville Extension Club. In honor of her extensive community service, Beulah was named Webberville Citizen of the Year in 1990, ``Queen of Webberville'' by the Webberville Fireman's Organization in 1996, and has served as Grand Marshal in a Webberville parade. 
   The town of Webberville and the State of Michigan are lucky to have Beulah Cool to call their own. I applaud her on her more than 70 years of community service through education and volunteer work and I wish her a very happy 96th birthday.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the St. Clair Shores, Michigan, AMVETS Post 121 upon the celebration of its 50th anniversary taking place this February 24th. 
   For the past 50 years the post has strived to make a home for many American service men and women, while in service and after they received an honorable discharge. The post has been involved in the St. Clair Shores Memorial festivities, and has provided community service and child welfare for both veterans and non-veterans yearly by giving college scholarships, baskets of food during Christmas time, and food and clothing donations to local children's facilities. 
   I applaud AMVETS Post 121 for its committed remembrance of the men and women who have served our country in the Armed Forces. Their dedication and hard work for veterans and non-veterans alike should serve a model for other veteran organizations around the country. It is an honor today, on behalf of the U.S. Senate, to recognize AMVETS Post 121 on its 50th annviersary.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police (MACP) who are attending their Mid-Winter Training Conference this week. I want to commend Michigan's Chiefs of Police for their dedication to protecting Michigan's citizens--for their unwavering effort to keep our communities safe, even when that means putting themselves in harm's way. 
   The MACP training conference is evidence of their commitment to learning the most current state-of-the-art practices and systems used by law enforcement in order to keep Michiganians as safe as possible. 
   Mr. President, I have had the pleasure of working with some of these police chiefs on legislation. Through this work, I have only gained more respect and appreciation for their dedication and their expertise in law enforcement issues. 
   At a time when some politicians are supporting clemency for terrorists, and others are effectively pitting our law enforcement officers against the very people they are protecting, I think it is essential that we publicly recognize the exemplary role that our police chiefs and officers play. 
   I am proud to have this opportunity, on behalf of the U.S. Senate, to publicly express our gratitude to police chiefs and officers across the country who risk their lives to keep us safe--who work every day on the side of law-abiding citizens. I call on all elected representatives to join me in supporting the efforts of police chiefs to keep our communities safe.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to offer my congratulations to Center Line High School in Center Line, Michigan, upon its recognition by the US Department of Education as a Blue Ribbon School. Fully accredited by the North Central Association and continuously endorsed since 1956, Center Line High School has demonstrated excellence in a variety of areas, including student focus and support, active teaching and learning, leadership, community partnerships, and educational vitality. 
   The Department of Education's Blue Ribbon Program promotes and supports the improvement of education in America by: identifying and recognizing schools that are models of excellence and equity, that demonstrate a strong commitment to educational excellence for all students; making research based, self-assessment criteria available to schools looking for a way to reflect on how they are doing; and encouraging schools, both within and among themselves, to share information about best practices which is based on a shared understanding of the standards which demonstrate educational success. 
   Center Line High School demonstrated its excellence to the Department of Education through a variety of innovative programs intended to prepare its students academically, physically, and socially to participate productively in this rapidly changing world. Center Line High is in its second year on an alternating A/B block schedule, which has allowed the school to implement 11 new courses this past year. Beyond its academic and curricular superiority, Center Line offers an array of student-run activities that integrate learning and service with community involvement. One such program allows students the opportunity to operate a branch of the Metro Credit Union (one of the first student-run credit unions in the county and state) while the student-initiated Community Outreach Program gives students the chance to engage in area service projects. 
   I applaud Center Line High School on its excellence in education and its commitment to the development of students and the community. I also with to congratulate the school once again upon its designation as a Blue Ribbon School by the Department of Education.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning the retirement of the Most Reverend Moses B. Anderson, S.S.E. Auxiliary Bishop of Detroit. Bishop Anderson was the first African-American Catholic Bishop in the State of Michigan. 
   Bishop Anderson will be honored at a Gratitude Dinner at the Sacred Heart Major Seminary in the City of Detroit on February 17, 2000, at which time he will also be presented with the Mother Theresa Duchemin Maxis Award. 
   Bishop Anderson has served the Catholic Church since his ordination as a priest in 1958. He was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Detroit in 1982, was consecrated in 1983 at the Blessed Sacrament Church, and was appointed Pastor of Precious Blood Parish in Detroit in 1992. While in service to the Catholic Church in Greater Detroit, Bishop Anderson has specialized in several areas, most notably those dealing with black theology, art, and evangelization. 
   Bishop Anderson's membership list includes: the National Catholic Conference of Bishops--United States Catholic Conference, the Society for the Study of Black Religion, the New Detroit Board of Trustees, Boysville of America, and the Ecumenical Forum. He has also given lectures or written papers on the following topics: Black Theology, Evangelization-Indigenization, the History of the Black Church in Louisiana, Racism--The Impoverishment of the Body and the Spirit, Black Awareness--The Harlem Renaissance and the Negritude Poets, and Black Spirituality. 
   Bishop Anderson's lengthy list of accomplishments also includes educational achievements, including the following degrees: Doctor of Humane Letters, St. Michael College; Honorary Degree in L.L.D. from Kansas Newman College; Honorary Doctor of Humanities Degree from Madonna College; and Honorary Doctor of Laws Degree from the University of Detroit Mercy. 
   I applaud the Most Reverend Moses B. Anderson for his contribution to the Catholic Church and the Greater Detroit area and wish to take this opportunity to personally thank him for his many years of selfless service to the City of Detroit and the State of Michigan.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate and honor two young Michigan students who have achieved national recognition for exemplary volunteer service in their communities. Jonathan Quarles of Flint and Gopalkrishna Trivedi of Grosse Pointe Park have just been named State Honorees in The 2000 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program, an annual honor conferred on only one high school student and one middle-level student in each state, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. 
   Mr. Quarles, a high school senior at Flint Northern High School, founded Students Against Violence Everywhere  (S.A.V.E.), a group that helps discourage crime through creative presentations. Since the group was founded in 1997, they have worked in collaboration with many organizations, including leadership workshops. ``In the past year, not one teen was killed by violence in Flint,'' says Jonathan. 
   Mr. Trivedi, an eighth-grader at Pierce Middle School, repaired and upgraded 120 obsolete computers to help non-English speaking students learn and work in English. He encouraged two of his computer classmates to help with the project, and the three students proceeded to carry the outdated computers from the school basement to the computer lab. They then inspected each computer to diagnose problems, and replaced all defective parts. Once the computers were repaired, Gopal then formatted the hard drives, installed CD-ROM's, and loaded each with an operating system. Most of these modified computers were donated to students who had recently arrived from Albania with very few financial resources. Gopal donated the rest of the computers to the school's science lab and the computer keyboarding lab. ``It is a really good feeling when sacrifices are made for other people and those sacrifices actually change some lives for the better,'' said Gopal recently. 
   In light of numerous statistics that indicate Americans today are less involved in their communities than they once were, it's vital that we encourage and support the kind of selfless contributions these young people have made. People of all ages need to think more about how we, as individual citizens, can work together at the local level to ensure the health and vitality of our towns and neighborhoods. Young volunteers like Mr. Quarles and Mr. Trivedi are inspiring examples to all of us, and are among our brightest hopes for a better tomorrow. 
   The program that brought these young role models to our attention--The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards--was created by The Prudential Insurance Company of America in partnership with the National Association of Secondary School Principals in 1995 to impress upon youth volunteers that their contributions are critically important and highly valued, and to inspire other young people to follow their example. In only five years, the program has become the nation's largest youth recognition effort based solely on community service, with nearly 75,000 youngsters participating since its inception. 
   Mr. Quarles and Mr. Trivedi should be extremely proud to have been singled out from such a large group of dedicated volunteers. As part of their recognition, they will come to Washington in early May along with other year-2000 Spirit of Community honorees from across the country, for several days of special events, including a Congressional breakfast reception on Capitol Hill. While here in Washington, ten will be named America's top youth volunteers of the year by a distinguished national service selection committee chaired by Senators Byron Douglas of North Dakota and SUSAN COLLINS of Maine. 
   I heartily applaud Mr. Quarles and Mr. Trivedi for their initiative in seeking to make their communities better places to live, and for the positive impact they have had on the lives of others. I would also like to salute other young people in my state who were named Distinguished Finalists by The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards for their outstanding volunteer service. They are: Nupur Kanodia of Rochester Hills, Lauren Lubowicki of Fenton, David Sherman of Dearborn, Korina Smith of Douglas, Brooke Southgate of Unionville, and Perry Williams of Grand Rapids. 
   All of these young people have demonstrated a level of commitment and accomplishment that is truly extraordinary in today's world. They deserve our sincere admiration and respect. Their actions show that young Americans can--and do--play important roles in their communities, and that America's community spirit continues to hold tremendous promise for the future.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Rick Jones, Captain of the Road Patrol for the Eaton County Sheriff Department, on his selection as the 1999 Service to Children Award winner. This award will be presented to Captain Jones by the Eaton County Child Abuse and Neglect Prevention Council. 
   Captain Jones was selected for his volunteer work benefitting youth activities throughout Eaton County. Captain Jones' involvement in youth activities in his area range from efforts to build both the Eaton Rapids Playground of Dreams and the Potterville Imagination Station Playground, to volunteer work with the ``Kids to the Rescue'' Earth Day activities, Grand Ledge Kid's Day, 4H programs, and the Special Olympics. 
   Captain Jones' efforts toward improving his community also reach beyond his work with area youth. He has participated in area programs including Meals on Wheels, 4-H, Eaton Shelter, and Eaton Community Hospice. 
   The newsletter of the Eaton County Child Abuse and Prevention Council said this about Captain Jones: ``Living a life of service is paramount to Rick Jones *.*.* As a young Sheriff's deputy, Jones learned that `life could be pretty short.' After being shot at, Rick Jones found himself evaluating life's meaning and concluding that what is truly important are contributions to his community.'' 
   Eaton County, and all of Michigan, are lucky to have Rick Jones to call their own. I am sure that his outlook on life and his volunteer work have made a positive difference in the lives of many in his community. It is an honor today, on behalf of the U.S. Senate, to congratulate Captain Jones on his receipt of the Service to Children Award.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the Veterans of Foreign Wars National Home on their 75th anniversary. The VFW National Home--also known as the VFW National Home for children--located in Eaton Rapids, MI, celebrated this milestone birthday on the seventh of January, 2000. 
   The VFW National Home for Children has served more than 1,600 people across the country who have family ties to members of the VFW and Ladies Auxiliary. The 600 acre facility grew from a plot of land that was initially donated by a Jackson farmer in 1925. Originally created as an orphanage for children of dead or disabled veterans, the home now has professional case workers on staff, while offering full college funding for children, a program for single parents, and other social programs. 
   The house is home to 91 children and 27 single parents. In addition to social services, it offers a nursery, sports programs, and several extracurricular activities. And, as if this wasn't impressive enough, the VFW National Home is run totally on private donations. 
   Mr. President, Michiganians are privileged to have this important home in their state. It is an honor today, on behalf of the United States Senate, to offer congratulations on their anniversary and thanks to all of those who donate their time, their love, and their financial resources to the VFW National Home.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the Warren, Michigan, YMCA upon the 20th anniversary of its annual ``Gourmet Dinner.'' The Warren YMCA holds a unique dinner each year, raising money for summer camp and similar youth projects. The banquet is attended by area residents who are treated to food and drinks prepared by area restauranteurs and served by notable community members. 
   Part of the funds raised from the gathering will go toward camperships for needy children, while some of the monies will supplement the Friday night drop-in centers for youths currently held at various church and school buildings around the city. Gym time, craft projects, pool and ping-pong games, and dances are also part of the available activities. 
   The event, believed to be the first of its kind in the Warren area, has been  considered a perennial success by members of the YMCA's Executive Board as it merges community cooperation with youth development. 
   The fund raising dinner is a very special event in Metropolitan Detroit and has been a success since its inauguration 20 years ago. I applaud the Warren YMCA for its vision of service and the community for its continued involvement in this very worthy event.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator HATCH in introducing the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act. 
   Mr. President, no company can grow if it fails to find enough employees with the skills needed to get the job done. And that is precisely the situation faced by our high-tech companies today. A Joint Venture: Silicon Valley study found that a lack of skilled workers is costing Silicon Valley companies $3 to $4 billion every year. A Computer Technology Industry Association study concluded that a shortage of information technology professionals is costing the U.S. economy as a whole $105 billion per year. 
   These costs should not be seen as mere abstractions. Because of skilled labor shortages, an increasing number of highly productive firms have had to curtail their economic activities and/or move offshore. At an October 21, 1999 Senate Immigration Subcommittee hearing, Susan DeFife, CEO of womenCONNECT.com, noted that ``as investment capital flows into start-ups and puts them on a fast growth track, the demand for workers will continue to far exceed the supply. In order to fill these positions, the options for tech companies are not particularly attractive: we can limit our growth, but then we lose the ability to compete; we can `steal' employees from other companies, which makes none of us stronger and forces us to constantly look over our shoulders; or, in the case of larger companies I know, move operations off-shore.'' 
   None of these solutions is good for our economy or our workers. As e-commerce and other forms of high technology become increasingly integrated throughout our economy, the long-term solution to our dilemma will be for earlier and better training for our young people to qualify them for high-tech tasks. But we are losing productivity and opportunities for growth right now. If we are to maintain our high-tech edge in an increasingly competitive global market, we must find the skilled workers we need wherever we can. 
   We must meet our training and education needs. And we need wise and careful reforms to our immigration laws. This is not an either/or proposition. We have studied this approach for some time. In February of 1998 the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on high technology workforce issues. This hearing demonstrated that many companies could not find enough qualified professionals to fill key jobs. It also showed that the foreign-born individuals hired by companies on H-1B temporary visas typically many additional jobs for Americans through their skills and motivations. 
   Mr. President, shortly after that hearing, Congress raised the cap on H-1B visas from 65,000 to 115,000 in FY1999 and 2000, and 107,500 in 2001. A number of provisions in this legislation increased enforcement efforts and established a $500 fee per visa--currently generating $75 million per year--for training and scholarships to encourage Americans to enter high-tech related fields. 
   Unfortunately, this was not enough. Despite the raised cap, a tight labor market, increasing globalization and burgeoning economic growth all combined to increase demand for skilled workers. The 1999 cap on H-1B visas was reached by June of last year. 
   We must do more to enable American employers to hire job-creating high-tech professionals. That is why I have sponsored this legislation that would: 
   Provide a temporary increase in H-1B visas. Caps would be increased by 80,000 for FY 2000; 87,500 for FY 2001; and 130,000 for FY 2002. 
   Create exemptions for universities, research facilities, and graduate degree recipients to help keep in the country top graduates and those who help educate Americans. 
   Modify per-country limits on permanent employment visas to allow companies to hire talent without regard to nationality. 
   Increase labor mobility by allowing H-1B professionals to change jobs as soon as the new employer files the initial paperwork, instead of waiting for a new H-1B application to be approved. 
   Continue and extend the $500 per visa fee to provide over $150 million in additional funding over three years for training and scholarships. Counting the existing money brought in by the fee, this will raise the total to over $375 million over three years and will help over 50,000 American students receive scholarships in math, science or engineering. 
   These provisions will increase our economic competitiveness, sustain our economic growth, and provide new opportunities for workers and entrepreneurs. Julie Holdren, President and CEO of the Olympus Group, told the Immigration Subcommittee that ``For every H-1B worker I employ, I am able to hire ten more American workers.'' A study for the Public Policy Institute of California by U.C. Berkeley Professor Annalee Saxenian bears this testimony out. It found that Chinese and Indian immigrant entrepreneurs in northern California alone were responsible for employing 58,000 people, with annual sales of nearly $17 billion. 
   Critics of the last H-1B visa increase have been proven spectacularly wrong, as the U.S. economy added 387,000 new jobs in January and the unemployment rate dropped to a 30-year low of 4 percent. Specialty jobs in the computer industry alone are projected to grow by 1.5 million between 1998 and 2008, according to the Department of Labor. 
   President Clinton's former chief economic advisor, Laura D'Andrea Tyson argues that ``it's time to raise the cap on H-1B visas yet again and to provide room for further increases as warranted. Silicon Valley's experience reveals that the results will be more jobs and higher incomes for both Americans and immigrant workers.'' 
   Mr. President, the final word should belong to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. At a Budget Committee hearing last month he was asked ``Do you believe we should do something with our laws--immigration--that would allow high tech ..... labor to come into the country to ease the burden'' on our labor force? 
   Chairman Greenspan responded: ``I would certainly agree with that. It's clear that under existing circumstance ..... aggregate demand is putting very significant pressures on an ever-decreasing available supply of unemployed labor. The one obvious means that one can use to offset that is expanding the number of people we allow in, either generally or in a specifically focused area.'' 
   By increasing the number of highly skilled professionals we allow to work in America, and providing additional funding for training and scholarships, we will create jobs for all Americans and keep our high-tech driven economic expansion on the move.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, this week, I joined with my good friends, Senator LIEBERMAN and Senator SANTORUM, to introduce the Savings for Working Families Act of 2000. This important legislation would enable low-income working Americans to increase their savings and build assets, thus allowing them to enter and become a contributing part of America's economic mainstream and benefit from its unprecedented period of economic growth. 
   Right now, despite the fact that the net worth of American families has increased dramatically over recent years, the net worth of families with incomes below $25,000 per year has actually decreased. As many as 20 percent of American families are ``unbanked''--meaning that they do not have either a checking or a savings account. 
   This disparity has had a severe and damaging affect not only on the ability of lower-income Americans to obtain financial assets but it has drastically reduced the chances of the working poor to achieve upper, or even middle class status. Even more distressing is the impact this disparity has had on children and minorities: one-third of all American households, and 60 percent of African-American households, have zero or negative net financial assets and 40 percent of all white children, and a staggering 73 percent of all Black children, grow up in households with zero or negative net financial assets. 
   The lack of financial assets creates almost insurmountable obstacles against purchasing a home, starting a small business or investing in a post-secondary education--all investments which would enable these families to better their economic status and fully participate in the American dream, a dream which should be available to all American's willing to put forth the effort and initiative. 
   And, Madam President, providing economic opportunity to all Americans is not only the right thing to do morally, but it is the right thing to do economically. Not only will this legislation empower our lower-income working Americans but it will benefit the entire society in the form of new businesses, new jobs, increased earnings, greater tax revenue, reduced welfare expenditures and a higher national savings rate. Case-in-point, Mr. President, IDAs yield over $5 for every $1 invested. 
   Simply put, Madam President, without productive assets such as a home, a college education or a business upon which to build a successful financial future, the working poor may continue to work but they will also continue to remain poor. 
   The legislation we are introducing today, the Savings for Working Families Act of 2000, recognizes the need to invest in the working poor: empower them with the ability to build assets, own a piece of their neighborhood and achieve wealth. 
   Specifically, this legislation would establish Individual Development Accounts for poorer Americans, through which account holders can deposit any discretionary earned income and their Earned Income Tax Credit refund and have up to $500 of their savings matched, each year, by a financial institution. A tax credit would be made available to financial institutions and for investment in qualified non-profits administering qualified IDA programs, in order to provide incentives to match, dollar-for-dollar, IDA account savings, up to $500 per person per year. 
   In order to promote asset building, the matched savings accounts would be restricted to buying a first home, receiving post-secondary education or training, or starting a small business. In addition, account holders would participate in classes designed to increase their financial literacy and better prepare them for full and successful participation in the mainstream economy. 
   Madam President, I am also pleased to note that Congress has already recognized the important contributions that IDAs make to our communities and our economy in several important ways. In 1996, Congress included in the 1996 welfare overhaul law, a provision allowing states to include IDAs in their Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF)--welfare-to-work--plans. Since then, 28 states have included IDAs in their state TANF plans, 27 states have passed some form of IDA legislation, and five more states have IDA legislation pending. In addition, Congress established the Assets for Independence Act in 1998, which provided $125 million over 5 years for IDA demonstration programs. This Act is expected to reach an additional 30,000 to 40,000 working-poor Americans by 2003. 
   Last summer, the Senate tax bill included a provision, similar to this bill, which would also have established tax incentives to encourage financial institutions to match the savings of lower-income account holders. I feel privileged to have voted for the tax bill, which included many pro-family and pro-community provisions such as the establishment of the Individual Development Accounts. 
   Lastly, I am proud to be the lead sponsor of comprehensive bi-partisan and bi-cameral community development and renewal legislation, the American Community Renewal Act, which includes IDAs as a means by which communities can help themselves. Please allow me to take this opportunity and thank Senators LIEBERMAN and SANTORUM for their continued support and effort of IDAs and the American Community Renewal Act. 
   In closing, Madam President, the Savings for Working Families Act of 2000 provides a common sense long-term solution by providing working lower-income Americans the education and the tools by which they gain the financial know-how necessary to succeed in today's economy. 
   It is important to recognize that achieving family development, neighborhood revitalization and community resurgence begins by empowering people to help themselves--this legislation provides this opportunity. I am looking forward to working with my colleagues this session to ensure the passage of the Savings for Working Families Act into law.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to praise Ford Motor Company's president and chief executive, Mr. Jacques Nasser, and Ford Motor Company's unprecedented gift of a home computer, color printer and unlimited access to the Internet to each and every one of Ford's 350,000 thousand employees worldwide. 
   Through this act, Ford Motor Company has shown that it has truly recognized the need to provide all Americans with computer and Internet access. Not a single Ford employee will be left out of Ford's initiative to provide its people with access to the Information Age. To its great credit, Ford has recognized that competing in today's high-tech global marketplace means doing everything possible to secure and train a skilled and informed workforce. 
   What is more, Mr. President, Ford has recognized that any company that wants to continue to succeed must see to it that everyone in its workforce, and not just a select few ``specialists'' be fully plugged in to the Information Age. 
   Mr. President, there is a growing digital divide in this country. Although over 40 percent of all households owned computers and one-quarter had Internet access by the end of 1998, figures show a disturbing and significant gap between two growing classes: the technical haves and the technical have-nots. This divide is defined by income and education levels, race and geographical location. 
   Household with incomes of $75,000 and greater are more than twenty times more likely to have Internet access in the home than households in the lowest income levels. Wealthier  families are nine times as likely to have a computer in the home. Whites are more likely than African Americans or Hispanics to have Internet access from any location, including work and the home. In addition, where a family lives can impact the likelihood of having computer and Internet access, regardless of income level. Americans living in rural areas are lagging behind in Internet access. Even at the lowest income levels, households in urban areas are more than twice as likely as their rural counterparts to have Internet access. 
   We are all aware that the increasing dominance of computers throughout the workplace demands computer proficiency. Right now, 60 percent of all jobs require high-tech skills. Mr. President, it is only through readily available access and consistent use of computers and technology that Americans will gain the skills necessary to participate and succeed in the New Economy. And, it is only through a skilled and educated workforce that the United States will continue to maintain its dominance in the New Economy. 
   That means, Mr. President, that we cannot afford to leave anyone behind in our journey into the New Economy. We will need everyone to help us face the tasks ahead. I take this challenge seriously. That is why my New Millennium Classrooms Act would give businesses increased incentives to donate used but still highly useful computers to our schools. It's unconscionable that 32 percent of public schools have only one classroom with access to the Internet when U.S. businesses are trying to figure out what to do with literally millions of used computers. It's also bad policy. 
   We need to get everyone onto the information superhighway. And I strongly believe, Mr. President, that Ford's exceptional program will help us in that effort. It will ensure access to the fundamental tools of the digital economy, and that is one of the most significant investments in our country that we can make. Ford's initiative not only benefits their immediate workforce, but their families and our greater communities. I would encourage all of our companies to look closely at Ford's contributions and the overwhelming good it creates. 
   Again, please allow me to commend Mr. Nasser and Ford Motor Co, for their dedication and invaluable contribution.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator WYDEN, in introducing legislation to extend indefinitely the current moratorium on new and discriminatory Internet taxes. Once again, Senator WYDEN has demonstrated his grasp of the crucial issues surrounding electronic commerce and has moved rapidly to assure that potential barriers to the new economy are eliminated before they do any harm. I am pleased to join him in his latest effort.  
   By now, it is obvious to everyone that e-commerce is the wave of the future. As a matter of fact, it's safe to say that the future is already here. During the week of December 6 alone, Americans bought $1.22 billion of merchandise online. Sales for 1999 should reach $64.8 billion. Beyond shopping, 5.3 million households had access to financial transactions like electronic banking and stock trading by the end of last year. 
   The rate of growth for Internet commerce has been exponential for the past several years. Unfortunately, it's also a tempting target for taxation by the Federal Government, States and localities. And that could slow the growth of e-commerce and of our entire economy. 
   We responded to this potential problem by passing Senator WYDEN's legislation in 1998, to place a three-year moratorium on new or discriminatory Internet taxes, fees or charges. That legislation also established a Commission to explore the issue of Internet taxation and to submit to Congress a list of recommendations on how the Federal Government should legislate in this area. 
   We are only halfway through the moratorium, but already it seems there are only two possible conclusions to the Commission. The first is that the wide differences of opinion within the Commission will make it impossible for the members to muster the majority of support necessary to submit a report. This is worrisome, Mr. President, because, unless action is taken by this Congress, the moratorium will expire and the door will be opened to new, discriminatory taxes on the Internet. 
   The other possibility, more recently offered, is that the Commission may actually recommend an extension of the current moratorium. Whatever the conclusion therefore, the role of Congress is clear; the Internet Tax Moratorium must be extended indefinitely. And because of the limited number of legislative days scheduled in this election year, the process of doing so 
   should begin now. 
   As everyone knows, the current moratorium only precludes new and discriminatory taxes. It does not address the more difficult question of how to apply existing, State sales taxes to Internet transactions. The Supreme Court has spoken to this issue, ruling that States can indeed impose taxes on transactions much like Internet sales--namely catalog sales. However, States cannot force a business to collect sales taxes on purchases made to States where they have no physical presence or ``nexus.'' This discrepancy in sales taxation between main street businesses and those that sell goods over the Internet will be difficult to address for the following reasons: 
   First, very soon every business will be an e-business in the sense that they will be using the Internet for sales, supplies, contracting and other purposes. We couldn't stop this process if we wanted to, and we shouldn't want to. According to one recent survey, 74 percent of brick and mortar, main street businesses have added ``click and mortar'' Internet services to their business. 
   Second, the border less nature of the Internet is going to make it difficult--if not impossible--to determine what constitutes ``nexus.'' For example, what happens when someone in California uses America Online in Virginia to order fudge from the ``shopmackinac'' website in Michigan, and ships them to a friend in Rhode Island? Which State should claim ``nexus?'' 
   Perhaps a ``destination-based'' Internet sales tax regime would be more effective in terms of collecting State sales taxes. Whatever the eventual outcome, I believe that in light of the present uncertainty it would not be proper for Congress to intervene on this issue. The States must have every opportunity to debate and possibly even initiate a model for addressing the current impasse. 
   What is necessary is Congressional action to ensure that new, discriminatory taxes are not levied on the Internet by States or localities as a means of substituting perceived lost revenue. Many Governors--including Governor Engler of Michigan--support an extension of the current Internet tax moratorium. 
   Access fees and similar Internet taxes, whether imposed by the States, localities, or the Federal government, pose a grave threat to the continued evolution of the Internet. America is experiencing a record period of growth and prosperity. In my view, the continued expansion of the economy is due primarily to electronic commerce. The spirit of entrepreneurship which has energized our nation, the adoption of new business models to more fully explore marketing and 
   sales possibilities and the dramatic increase in consumer and business services are all largely the product of our new e-economy. Why on earth would anyone, or any government, want to threaten this dynamic medium when it is still in its infancy by increasing the cost of doing business over the Internet? I certainly do not, and I will continue to work to ensure that neither the Federal government nor other units of government threaten electronic commerce. 
   If we are able to keep the government focused on removing impediments to electronic commerce rather than interfering in the development and implementation of new technologies then very soon the e-economy will simply be the economy, and our nation will be more prosperous as a result.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on February 6 of this year, in the Divine Providence Church, in Southfield, Michigan, several hundred Lithuanian Americans will gather to mark the tenth anniversary of the restoration of Lithuania's independence. Joined by Lithuania's ambassador to the United States, His Excellency, Stasys Sakalauskas, they will be celebrating their nation's original, modern independence day, February 16, 1918, as well as the events of March 1, 1990, the date on which Lithuania was finally and irrevocably released from the grip of Soviet communism. 
   Michigan's Lithuanian-American community also will celebrate the perseverance and sacrifice of their people, which enabled them to achieve the freedom they now enjoy. 
   I have reviewed the bare facts before: On March 11, 1990, the newly elected Lithuanian Parliament, fulfilling its electoral mandate from the people of Lithuania, declared the restoration of Lithuania's independence and the establishment of a democratic state. This marked a great moment for Lithuania and for lovers of freedom around the globe. 
   The people of Lithuania endured 51 years of oppressive foreign occupation. Operating under cover of the infamous Hitler-Stalin Pact of 1939, Soviet troops marched into Lithuania, beginning an occupation characterized by communist dictatorship and cultural genocide. 
   Even in the face of this oppression, the Lithuanian people were not defeated. They assisted their oppressors and kept their culture, their faith and their dream of independence very much alive even during the hardest times. 
   The people of Lithuania were even able to mobilize and sustain a non-violent movement for social and political change, a movement which came to be known as Sajudis. This people's movement helped guarantee a peaceful transition to independence through full participation in democratic elections on February 24, 1990. 
   Unfortunately, as is so often the case, peace and freedom had to be purchased again and again. In January of 1991, ten months after restoration of independence, the people and government of Lithuania faced a bloody assault by foreign troops intent on overthrowing their democratic institutions. Lithuanians withstood this assault, maintaining their independence and their democracy. Their successful use of non-violent resistance to an oppressive regime is an inspiration to all. 
   Lithuania's integration into the international community has been swift and sure. On September 17, 1991, the reborn nation became a member of the United Nations and is a signatory to a number of its organizations and other international agreements. It also is a member of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and the Council of Europe. 
   Lithuania is an associate member of the European Union, has applied for NATO membership and is currently negotiating for membership in the WTO, OECD and other Western organizations. 
   The United States established diplomatic relations with Lithuania on July 28, 1992. But our nation never really broke with the government and people of Lithuania. The United States never recognized the forcible incorporation of Lituania into the U.S.S.R., and views the present Government of Lithuania as a legal continuation of the inter-war republic. Indeed, for over fifty years the United States maintained a bipartisan consensus that our nation would refuse to recognize the forcible incorporation of Lithuania into the former Soviet Union. 
   America's relations with Lithuania continue to be strong, friendly and mutually beneficial. Lithuania has enjoyed Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) treatment with the United States since December, 1991. Through 1996, the United States has committed over $100 million to Lithuania's economic and political transformation and to address humanitarian needs. In 1994, the United States and Lithuania signed an agreement of bilateral trade and intellectual property protection, and in 1997 a bilateral investment treaty. 
   In 1998 the United States and Lithuania signed The Baltic Charter Partnership. That charter recalls the history of American relations with the area and underscores our ``real, profound, and enduring'' interest in the security and independence of the three Baltic states. As the Charter also notes, our interest in a Europe whole and free will not be ensured until Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are secure. 
   Mr. President, I commend the people of Lithuania for their courage and perseverance in using peaceful means to regain their independence. I pledge to work with my colleagues to continue working to secure the freedom and independence of Lithuania and its Baltic neighbors, and I join with the people of Lithuania as they celebrate their independence.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I rise today to speak in favor of S. 2005 which would repeal the effective capital gains tax increase contained in the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999. This legislation would protect small business owners from paying taxes on money not actually received. 
   Overlooked in last year's legislation was a provision that repealed the installment method for accrual method taxpayers when assets or entire businesses are sold. Under this new method, the seller of an asset or business is required to pay taxes on total gains in the first year of the sale, no matter when the actual proceeds are received. S. 2005 would revert this practice to its previous method in which the seller of an asset only paid taxes on the profits from the installment received in that year if he or she should receive payments in increments. 
   While this tax measure provides for only modest tax revenue, the negative impact on small business owners that this measure affects is quite significant. In effect, this tax increase cripples seller financing of small businesses and prevents thousands of men and women from purchasing small businesses. By potentially reducing the sale price of small businesses by up to 20 percent or more, small business owners will be much less likely to sell their businesses. Larger publicly traded corporations are not impacted as they tend to use other financing methods involving cash or stock transactions. So, this tax increase unfairly targets small business owners already overwhelmed with federal taxes and regulations. 
   Madam President, it makes common sense that taxes should only be paid when profits are realized--and not on money that will not be collected for years to come. Small businesses are an important provider of new jobs and a driving force in this nation's economy. We must not penalize or restrict such a vibrant source of innovation, invention and creativity that has enabled the United States to realize previously unimaginable prosperity. 
   I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in support of this legislation so essential in the success of this great nation.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I wanted to make a few comments about the legislation we are about to pass. Before I do so, I would like to thank a number of people for their help in this effort. 
   First, I would like to thank my colleagues who cosponsored this legislation: Senators FEINSTEIN, LIEBERMAN, DEWINE, GRASSLEY, COVERDELL, and GRAHAM. Their support was crucial to moving forward with this bill and doing so in a timely fashion. Second, I would like to thank Senator HATCH, his Judiciary Chief Counsel Manus Cooney, his Deputy Chief Counsel Sharon Prost, his Chief of Staff Patricia Knight, and Bruce Artim and Pattie DeLoatche, all of whose commitment to seeing this effort through to fruition I appreciate both for the advice and guidance they provided and as the act of friendship I recognize it to be. Third, I would like to thank Senator BIDEN and his staff, especially Marcia Lee, whose assistance and cooperation in working out a final version of this bill acceptable to all involved, including the Administration, was indispensable. I would also like to thank my good friend Fred Upton, who first brought the serious problem that is the focus of this legislation to my attention, and Congressman BLILEY and his able staff, especially John Manthei, who patiently tolerated and assisted with the vagaries of bicameral legislative drafting. Finally, I would like to thank my own staff, especially my Subcommittee General Counsel Chase Hutto, who worked tirelessly and creatively on this effort, and Lee Otis, my Subcommittee Chief Counsel.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will briefly comment on this legislation. First, I thank the cosponsors of this legislation, the Millennium Digital Commerce Act, and Senator WYDEN, the lead cosponsor of the legislation, and Senators MCCAIN, BURNS, and LOTT, who joined as cosponsors. I also thank Senator LEAHY, Senator SARBANES, Senator HOLLINGS, Senator MCCAIN and others who have worked with Senator WYDEN and me in moving this through the legislative process. I express my appreciation to all my colleagues. 
   As we move into the era of e-commerce it is important that people who wish to engage in commercial transactions online over the Internet be able to do so as effectively and efficiently as possible. Part of the challenge we confront is when people are entering into contracts in this nonwritten context, the potential exists for questions to be raised as to the validity of the contractual arrangements. Without getting into all the details, the goal of the Millennium Digital Commerce Act is to address this issue. Approximately 42 States have already passed what in effect are digital signature authentication laws which address contracts entered into online or which address the validity of contracts entered into through the web. The problem is those 42 bills are all different. It is possible for people to argue that a contract is valid in one State and not valid in the State of the other contracting party and, thus, is an invalid document. 
   The purpose of our legislation is to try to make all such agreements valid if they fit or meet some parameters, identical to the ones the States are moving toward; a uniform system. In short, we believe this will be an interim approach until the States have passed a model uniform act. If we don't do this, impediments will exist between parties who wish to contract via the Internet and through electronic commerce. We believe the passage of this bill will relieve those impediments and allow for e-commerce to continue to expand and grow and strengthen our economy. 
   I am very pleased at the passage of the bill today, and look forward to working with our counterparts in the House, they have passed a slightly different bill, to pound out a final consensus through the conferencing process and bring back to the Senate the output of that process. I hope to do this very early in the next session, so we can enact this legislation and move it to the President for his signature, and, as I said at the outset, improve the efficiency with which we engage in an expanded e-commerce universe. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the Senate is soon expected to pass the Millennium Digital Commerce Act--a bill introduced by Senators WYDEN, MCCAIN, BURNS, LOTT and myself which is designed to promote electronic commerce. I rise today to speak in support of this legislation and to thank the cosponsors for their tireless efforts to pass this legislation. I believe it will have a profound impact on the way commerce is conducted on the Internet. 
   By now, all of us have heard the prophetic pronouncements: ``The Internet will change of all of our lives.'' ``The Computer Age is reshaping the world.'' And so on. These words are true, and a review of the indicators which document the Internet's extraordinary growth bear this out. In 1993 about 90,000 Americans had access to these on-line resources. By early 1999 that number had grown to about 81 million, an increase of about 900 percent. The Computer Industry Almanac predicts 320 million Internet users world-wide by the end of the year 2000. 
   And now the figures are coming in on how electronic commerce is transforming the way we do business. They are equally impressive. E-commerce between businesses has grown to an estimate $64.8 billion for 1999. 10 million customers shopped for some product using the Internet in 1998 alone. And 5.3 million households had access to financial transactions like electronic banking and stock trading by the end of 1999. 
   While the Internet has experienced almost exponential growth since its inception, there is still room to expand. Today, new technologies enable the Internet to serve as an efficient new tool for companies to transact business as never before. This capability is provided by the development of secure electronic authentication methods. These technologies permit an individual to positively identify the person with whom they are transacting business and to ensure that information being shared by the parties has not been tampered with or modified without the knowledge of both parties. While such technologies are seeing limited use today, the growth of this application has out-paced government's ability to appropriately modify the legal framework governing the use of electronic signatures and other authentication methods. 
   The growth of electronic signature technologies will increasingly allow organizations to enter into contractual arrangements without ever having to drive across town or fly thousands of miles to personally meet with a client or potential business partner. The Internet is prepared to go far beyond the ability to buy a book or order apparel on-line. It is ready to lead a revolution in the execution of business transactions which may involve thousands or millions of dollars in products or services; transactions so important they require that both parties enter into a legally binding contract. 
   Mr. President, the Millennium Digital Commerce Act is designed to promote the use of electronic signatures in business transactions and contracts. At present, the greatest barrier to such transactions is the lack of a consistent and predictable national framework of rules governing the use of electronic signatures. Over forty States have enacted electronic authentication laws, and no two laws are the same. This inconsistency deters businesses from  fully utilizing electronic signature technologies for contracts and other business transactions. The differences in our State laws create uncertainty about the effectiveness or legality of an electronic contract signed with an electronic signature. This legal uncertainty limits the potential of electronic commerce, and, thus, our nation's economic growth. 
   Fortunately, the need for uniformity in electronic authentication rules was recognized early by the States. For the past two years, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Law, an organization comprised of e-commerce experts from the States, has been working to develop a uniform system for the use of electronic signatures for all fifty States. Their product, the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, or UETA, was finished in July. As was expected, the UETA is an excellent piece of work and I look forward to the day when this model legislation is enacted by each of the 50 states. 
   But agreement on the final language of the UETA proposal is not the same as enactment, and despite the hard work of the Commissioners, uniformity will not occur until all fifty States actually enact the UETA. That will likely take some time. Because some State legislatures are not in session next year and other States have more pressing legislative items, it could take three to four years for forty-five or fifty States to enact the UETA. When you consider the changes that have taken place in just the last two years, it is obvious that in the high-technology sector 
   four years is an eternity. 
   The Digital Millennium Commerce Act is therefore designed as an interim measure to provide relief until the States adopt the provisions of the UETA. It will provide companies the federal framework they need until a national baseline governing the use of electronic authentication exists at the State level. Once States enact the UETA, the Federal preemption is lifted. 
   To be specific, this legislation promotes electronic commerce in the following manner. First and foremost, the legislation provides that the electronic signatures used to agree to a contract shall not be denied effect solely because they are electronic in nature. This provision assures that a company will be able to rely on an electronic contract and that another party will not be able to escape such certainty, this bill will reduce the likelihood of dissatisfied parties attempting to escape electronic contractual agreements and transactions. 
   To ensure a level playing field for all types of authentication, the bill grants parties to a transaction the freedom to determine the technologies to be used in the execution of an electronic contract. In essence, this assures technology neutrality because businesses and consumers, not government, will make the decisions as to what type of electronic signatures and authentication technologies will be used in transactions. 
   Since the Internet is inherently an international medium, consideration must also be given to the manner in which the U.S. conducts business with overseas governments and businesses. This legislation therefore sets forth a series of principles for the international use of electronic signatures. In the last year, U.S. negotiators have been meeting with the European Commissioners to discuss electronic signatures in international commerce. In these negotiations, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the State Department have worked in support of an open system governing the use of authentication technologies. Some European nations oppose this concept, however. For example, Germany insists that electronic transactions involving a German company must utilize a German electronic signature application. I applaud the Administration for their steadfast opposition to that approach. This bill will bolster and strengthen the U.S. position in these international negotiations by establishing the following principles as the will of the Congress: 
   One, paper-based obstacles to electronic transactions must be eliminated. 
   Two, parties to an electronic transaction should choose the electronic authentication technology. 
   Third, parties to a transaction should have the opportunity to prove in court that their authentication approach and transactions are valid. 
   Fourth, the international approach to electronic signatures should take a non-discriminatory approach to electronic signature. This will allow the fees market--not a government--to determine the type of authentication technologies used in international commerce. 
   Mr. President, it is my hope that adoption of these principles will increase the likelihood of an open, market-based international framework for electronic commerce. 
   Finally, the bill directs the Department of Commerce and Office of Management and Budget to report on Federal laws and regulations that might pose barriers to e-commerce and report back to Congress on the impact of such provisions and provide suggestions for reform. Such a report will serve as the basis for Congressional action, or inaction, in the future. 
   Mr. President, Senator WYDEN, Senator MCCAIN, Senator BURNS, the Majority Leader and I worked very hard to address the multiple of issues and concerns raised by those most affected by this legislation, namely the high-tech industry, the states and the consumer. I also want to recognize the considerable time and effort dedicated to this legislation by Senator LEAHY, Senator HOLLINGS and Senator SARBANES. Senators LEAHY and SARBANES worked diligently with the sponsors of this bill to address protection issues. In particular, my colleagues were concerned about the effects of this legislation on the notification and disclosure requirements required by law. I understand very well the concerns my colleagues raised and I agree with many, but not all, of their conclusions. 
   I believe the use of electronic records in electronic transactions is crucial to real growth in electronic commerce. And if e-commerce is to truly expand the opportunities for individuals, 
   businesses and consumers must have the freedom to agree to the types of documents and information they receive electronically. This right to choose to receive records electronically must be provided by Congress. The best way to do that is to pass laws which establish legal certainties for the sending, receipt and storage for the broad range of electronic records, and in particular, for records associated with loans and mortgages. Today, a vacuum exists with respect to these records. Aggressive businesses and small banks are filling this vacuum by providing loans and mortgages electronically even though there is question as to whether such transactions are protected under law. The increasing demand for such services demonstrates the popularity for electronic loans. By making applications easier and reducing associated consumer costs, these businesses are providing a service which is becoming increasingly popular with the American public. Rather than ignore this new market, or worse, condemn it, Congress should work with the industry and the proper regulatory agencies to ensure that these increased consumer opportunities are maintained and that relevant consumer protection provisions are modernized. I believe my proposal to permit individuals to opt-in to the receipt of records and to opt-out of receipt at any time represented reasonable middle ground on this issue, and am disappointed that my colleagues and I could not agree on a framework for records based on this model. 
   I intend to continue working toward a resolution which will permit individuals to have access to electronic records. It is simply in the long-term best interest of both consumers and the economy. And I am sure I will not labor on this effort alone. I am pleased to note that, among parties familiar with this debate, there is growing support for legislation to quickly address this important issue. 
   Mr. President, despite our philosophical differences, it was clear from the beginning that everyone involved was interested in working cooperatively to enact good legislation. And while I wish this bill could go further, I am nevertheless pleased with the product that we have passed today. So I want to thank Senator LEAHY and Senator SARBANES for their cooperation and hard work. I also want to recognize the efforts of the Ranking Member of the Commerce Committee, Senator HOLLINGS. Senator HOLLINGS made  it clear very early that he had concerns surrounding the issue of preemption. His staff and mine worked quickly and effectively to find common ground on this legislation and his spirit of compromise allowed us to move forward on a bill that I do not doubt he would have written differently. I want to thank him for his contribution. 
   Finally, I wish to express my thanks to the Technology Division of the State of Massachusetts. Governor Paul Cellucci's staff provided indispensable counsel on existing State law governing the use of electronic signatures and the manner in which Federal law can bolster or hamstring State contract law. I value the Governor's input and will continue to work with him to address the extent to which the States are impacted by this legislation as it advances. Of course, the business and technology sectors have also been crucial in helping to craft this bill. Representatives from the Information Technology Association of America, Ford, the Coalition for Electronic Authentication, the Information Technology Industry Council, Apple, the American Electronics Association, NCR, America Online, the Electronic Industry Alliance, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and the National Association of Manufacturers have each lent their time and expertise to this effort. I appreciate their contributions and look forward to continuing this effort to ensure that we develop the best approach possible to promote use of electronic signatures in business transactions. 
   Mr. President, despite the great work that has taken place here in the Senate, there is more work to do on this legislation. The House is currently working on a companion bill and I look forward to working with the Chairman of the Commerce Committee and other Representatives to ensure that the legislation sent to the President for his signature is the best and most effective approach to expanding electronic commerce possible.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Yes, Senator Hollings, that is certainly the intent of the legislation in its current form, but I would note that there must be a modicum of common sense involved in this approach. It is expected that states will pass consumer protection provisions in conjunction with the Electronic Transactions Act. It is important, however, that states not use the heading of ``consumer protection'' to enact changes which are inconsistent with the spirit of UETA and which threaten to undermine the uniformity which UETA is intended to convey. I believe the current language realizes these important goals.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support for this final Appropriations package. This is a good package that protects the Social Security surplus from being raided to pay for non-Social Security spending, that provides sufficient funds for important national programs, and which addresses critical issues specifically for Michigan. I trust that the President will be able to sign this quickly and get these Fiscal Year 2000 funds to the programs that will disburse them to Michiganians as soon as possible. 
    Mr. President, I am confident that this package will not raid the Social Security surplus as has been the norm for almost 30 years. The Congressional Leadership and the Administration  have crafted a package of appropriations and offsets that will not touch the Social Security surplus The precise bookkeeping agreed upon by the Administration and Congress used in this bill will help regulate how these funds are actually spent by the government, so that we don't spend the Social Security surplus. These aren't gimmicks, but finely crafted tools necessary for the Office of Management and Budget to ensure that bureaucrats don't spend their funds faster than Congress intended, so as to protect the Social Security surplus. 
   However, for those that are concerned that such tools could potentially be insufficient to control the rate of spending, and may in fact lead to the government dipping into the Social Security surplus, I will carefully track the revenue and outlay totals for the Federal Government over the next few months. And if it appears that we are falling behind in maintaining a sufficient buffer to protect the Social Security surplus, then I will immediately introduce and push for as large of a rescission package as necessary to prevent that from occurring. But that, in my opinion, will not be necessary. Already for the first month of Fiscal Year 2000, the Congressional Budget Office is reporting that we are running $6.4 billion ahead of last year, or almost $77 billion more in net revenue than last year. Considering the CBO estimated that net revenues would actually drop by $1 billion between Fiscal Years 1999 and 2000, I believe we will have more than enough of a non-Social Security surplus buffer to accommodate even the worst case assumptions that CBO may put forward. 
   As a specific note, Mr. President, one of the tools used to control spending in this package is an across-the-board 0.38 percent cut in discretionary spending. Although I would rather see specific cuts to achieve the $1.3 billion in fiscal discipline provided by this cut, such as cutting in half the funding for the Space Station, this is a modest enough cut to be palatable, especially considering the significant latitude given the executive agencies in finding these cuts. However, because of the vagaries of the budget process, the pay of Congressional Members has been exempted from this cut. I cannot support such unequal treatment, and declare that I will return an equal proportion of my Senatorial pay to the Department of Treasury. Nothing else would be fair. 
   But this package is not just about what it does not do. Mr. President, this appropriations package does a great deal of good as well. It increases funding for Head Start by over 10%, while providing over $35 billion for education in general, including funds for 100,000 new teachers while also significantly expanding the discretion local school districts will have to use that money for teacher testing and quality training. It will put 50,000 more police on our streets as well as providing over $2.1 billion for assistance programs to local law enforcement agencies. The National Institute of Health will see its funding increased by 15% to almost $18 billion, while important high-tech legislation that I sponsored to stop the poaching of corporate and identifiable World Wide Web address names by unscrupulous profiteers and carpet-baggers does not continue unimpeded. 
   And maybe most significantly, the unintended effects upon Medicare and Medicaid of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, as well as the onerous additional regulations levied by the Health Care 
   Financing Agency in implementing that Act, will be softened through the provision of over $27 billion in additional health care funds over the next 10 years. This will provide specific relief for Michigan's hospitals by easing the reductions in the reimbursements they receiving for treating our Medicare beneficiaries in Michigan, and thereby expanding the access for quality medical care. It will also increase the unrealistically low reimbursement rates set for Skilled Nursing Facility care, while also ensuring that the arbitrary $1,500 per patient cap on physical and rehabilitative therapy set by the Administration is not allowed to deny our seniors the help they need to recover from such debilitating conditions as strokes and severe heart conditions. It improves the ability of women to receive pap smear tests, provides greater access to renal dialysis treatment, while also making immunosuppressive drugs more readily available. And it provides very much needed protection for Rural Health Clinics and Federally Qualified Health Centers from capricious reductions in their reimbursements, thereby allowing them to protect the uninsured and Medicare dependent population that they overwhelmingly serve. 
   But, Mr. President, this package is good for Michigan is well as our nation. A number of issues that significantly affect my constituents are addressed in this package. Our unique Great Lakes environment is protected through the continued funding of the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, increased funding for the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, Sea Lamprey control, and Sea Grant Research funds, as well as funding for a new simulator at the Great Lakes Maritime Academy in Traverse City to ensure our commercial shipping maintains its peerless safety record. This appropriations package funds worthy projects such as Detroit's Focus:HOPE information technology training program for the city's poorest residents, Central Michigan's charter school and education performance institute, Northern Michigan's Olympics Training Facility, and almost $2.5 million in funding to protect and preserve Isle Royale National Park and Keweenaw National Historical Park. This bill brings new Tribal funding for a new band of the Pottawatomi Indians and $15 million more in PILT (Payment in Lieu of Taxes) funds which are desperately needed by Michigan's more rural counties. And on the international front, this package provides almost $2 million to support the Middle East Peace Process through the Wye River Accord agreement, as well as a number of policy and funding initiatives overseas such as continued support for Armenia in its dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh and the further development of education and infrastructure in Lebanon. 
   Mr. President, many will try to make political hay out of opposing this bill for this or that various reason. But on the whole, this final appropriations package achieves three very important goals: it stops the 30-year raid by big Washington spenders on the Social Security Trust Fund, it adequately funds important national priorities, and it addresses several specific programs in Michigan important to my constituents. We were sent to Washington to govern, Mr. President, and at this point in the session, I asked myself if I was going to be an effective legislator, or simply a politician. I'm glad I chose the former in supporting this bill. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to rise as a cosponsor of S. Con. Res. 74, a resolution which recognizes the United States Border Patrol's 75 years of service to this country. 
   These brave men and women serve, day in and day out, as both defenders and ambassadors of our nation. With professionalism, civility and a watchful eye, members of the United States Border Patrol watch out for illegal immigrants and the entry of illegal drugs. 
   It is a difficult task, Mr. President. But one that our Border Patrol Agents perform well. And these duties are not just difficult, Mr. President. Oftentimes they are dangerous as well. Particularly in this era of well-armed thugs and smugglers, Border Patrol Agents may find themselves out-gunned as they protect our nation's borders. 86 Border Patrol Agents and Pilots have lost their lives in the line of duty--6 in 1998 alone. 
   We all owe our Border Patrol our thanks for their bravery and their willingness to put in long, hard hours in service to their country. 
   I would like to make special note, Mr. President, of the members of the Detroit Sector of the U.S. Border Patrol. These fine individuals perform with grace in the face of very difficult assignments. In the Detroit sector, fewer than 20 Border Patrol field agents are expected to be responsible for four large Midwestern states--Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, an area covering hundreds of miles of border. This small number of Border Patrol agents also must assist INS investigators in responding to local law enforcement requests in these four states. 
   I salute the good work of the United States Border Patrol, and especially thank the members of the Detroit Sector for their work above and beyond the call of duty.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and congratulate the Wayne County Medical Society as they gather in celebration of their 150th Anniversary. 
   The Wayne County Medical Society has set a pioneering tradition in health care since it was founded on April 14, 1849. They began with only 50 physicians and have grown to include more than 4,200 physicians. They work together to promote unity and loyalty among physicians in the community and to raise awareness of public health issues concerning the citizens of Wayne County. 
   What is truly remarkable about this select group is the profound impact they have had on the public health of the people in Detroit and Wayne County. One of its most notable accomplishments was leading a polio immunization drive which vaccinated thousands of Detroiters and all but eliminated the threat of the crippling disease. 
   The WCMS continues to provide health care that shows no bounds with the free medical and dental clinic they run at the Webber School in Detroit. Every child is offered free services such as physical examinations, dental fluoride sealants and prophylaxis. The WCMS also takes a proactive approach to health care, in 1998 they sponsored a teen pregnancy conference with more than 500 Detroit Public School students in attendance. The children were encouraged to abstain from sex and to understand the consequences of not practicing safe sex. By sponsoring an annual party for foster children in Wayne the WCMS shows their commitment to the community extends beyond healthcare. The WCMS is truly an asset to the Detroit Community. 
   The accomplishments this elite group has made in the past 150 years are to be commended. Guided by the spirit of charity the WCMS has improved and enriched the lives of countless people. It is my hope that they will continue encouraging unity among physicians and be a crusader for public health in Detroit for many years to come.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Margaret Holtschlag on receiving the Michigan Teacher of the Year award given by the Michigan Department of Education. 
   Mrs. Holtschlag, a fourth grade teacher at Murphy Elementary School in the Haslet School District, was selected from nearly thirty regional finalists as the Michigan Teacher of the Year. Described by colleagues as an innovative, thoughtful and progressive teacher, her dedication is second to none. As the winning teacher, Mrs. Holtschlag will share her expertise as she travels across the state working with teachers to improve programs and teacher quality. 
   What is truly remarkable about Mrs. Holtschlag is that her classroom extends beyond a room filled with desks and chalkboards. Two years ago she took a group of students on a trip to Korea and set up an Internet pen-pal link between Haslet, China and Korea. In the past, her students have built weather stations and explored nearby wetlands. Additionally, her students have spent time at the Michigan Library and Historical Center, discovering and exploring aspects of Michigan history that can not be learned from a text book. 
   For twenty-one years Mrs. Holtschlag has devoted her life to teaching and making a positive impact on each and every student she encounters. Her captivating teaching style inspires both students and colleagues alike. This is truly a rare gift. 
   A quality education is one of the most important tools that a child needs and it gives me great joy to know that such a dynamic and caring teacher is helping to shape the lives of Michigan students.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to rise today and honor Imam Vehbi Ismail for his fifty years of dedicated service to the Islamic community. 
   The Imam has been an instrumental force in the Albanian American and Islamic communities in Michigan. Originally, from Albania he emigrated to the United States in 1949 after studying theology in Egypt. Through his spiritual leadership the Imam set himself on a path to improve the Albanian American community. One of his greatest accomplishments was the establishment of the Albanian Islamic Center where he served as the Senior Cleric. 
   What is truly remarkable about this extraordinary individual is his work in the areas of democratic and human rights. The Imam has been the driving force in the Michigan community, raising awareness for human rights for Albanians world wide. 
   The Imam has proudly served as one of the longest active Clerics in the country. His family and the Albanian American community look to him as the elder statesman and guiding spirit for their community. 
   Mr. President it is with sincere joy and appreciation that I honor the Imam Vehbi Ismail. He is truly an example of unselfish charity and an inspiration to many.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, apparently a UC had been entered into which had set in order speakers through Senator WELLSTONE. I know Senator ALLARD and I have been here for some time. I noticed Senator KENNEDY has joined us. We were hoping we might come up with another UC which would ensure continuing order in terms of the speakers; ideally, the order in which we have been here. If that is possible, I would appreciate it. Therefore, that leads me to propose that following the speech of Senator WELLSTONE, if we might then proceed in an order in which I would be allowed to speak next, followed by Senator ALLARD, followed by Senator KENNEDY, if that is possible. If it is not, we would be open to adjusting that. I am not sure how.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate having the opportunity to speak on this amendment. I yield myself such time as I might require at this point. I believe it will be probably 15 minutes. 
   Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment which, in my judgment, will help protect our children and our neighborhoods from the scourge of drugs and drug-related violence. 
   This amendment contains a number of provisions that are critical to our war on drugs. 
   It includes a package of provisions aimed at fighting the production and distribution of methamphetamines. 
   Authored by Senators ASHCROFT, HATCH, and GRASSLEY, these provisions include additional money to hire additional personnel, including almost $10 million for additional DEA agents to assist state and local law enforcement. 
   Also included is a provision raising penalties for offenses involving methamphetamines, including production of methamphetamine precursors. 
   And the amendment includes additional funding for prevention and treatment programs. 
   Contrary to some of the positions and assertions made, in fact, this amendment includes significant increases in those funding proposals. 
   The amendment also enhances penalties for drug distribution to minors and in or near schools. Also to protect our schools, the amendment provides incentives for schools to develop policies expelling students who bring drugs on school grounds and school choice for victims of school violence. 
   Mr. President, today I want to focus in particular on the amendment's provisions concerning sentences for powder cocaine dealers. These provisions are drawn from legislation I introduced earlier this year along with Senator ALLARD and quite a few other Senators. As the father of three young children, I am deeply disturbed by the trend for almost all of the last 7 years in teenage drug use. This represents a reversal, really, of the decade long progress we had been making in the war on drugs. 
   In 1997, 9.4 percent of teens reported recent use of marijuana, up 180 percent from 1992. The percentage of teens using cocaine tripled during those same years. And most disturbing of all, the greatest increases took place among our youngest teens. For example, the percentage of 12 and 13 year olds using cocaine increased 100 percent from 1992 to 1996, compared with a 58 percent increase among 17- and 18-year-olds. This spells trouble for our children. Increased drug use means increased danger of every social pathology we know. 
   This trend may finally have been arrested for most drugs. In 1998, the Monitoring the Future Study, prepared annually by the University of Michigan, showed improvements--although very modest ones--in levels of teenage drug use. All three grades studies--8th, 10th, and 12th--showed some decline in the proportion of students reporting any illegal drug use during the previous 12 months. Equally important, use by 8th graders, who started the upward trend in use at the beginning of this decade, declined for the second year in a row. 
   We also are finding heartening news in our war on violent crime. The FBI now reports that, since 1991, the number of homicides committed in the United States has dropped by 31 percent. Also since 1991, the number of robberies has fallen 32 percent. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, robberies fell a stunning 17 percent in 1997 alone. 
   This is good news, Mr. President. And there is widespread agreement among experts in the field that the principal cause of this decline in violent crime is our success in curbing the crack cocaine epidemic and the violent gang activities that accompany that epidemic. 
   The New York Times recently reported on a conference of criminologists held in New Orleans. Experts at the conference agreed that the rise and fall in violent crime during the 1980s and 1990s closely paralleled the rise and fall of the crack epidemic. 
   At the same time, there is a warning signal here. The most recent ``Monitoring the Future'' Study also showed an increase in the use of cocaine in all three grades studied. Use of both crack and powder cocaine within the past 30 days likewise rose in all three grades, except for powder cocaine in the 12th grade, where it did not fall but at least held steady. This is in contrast to the study's finding that the use of other drugs by kids may finally be leveling off, albeit at unacceptably high levels. Yet surprisingly, despite these developments, in last year's Ten-Year Plan for a National Drug Control Strategy, the administration proposed making sentences for crack dealers 5 times more lenient than they are today. 
   We have already heard the case made by the preceding speaker--and I suspect successive speakers on the other side of the aisle will be likewise making the case--that by somehow making crack sentences more lenient, notwithstanding the clear evidence that as we have gotten tough on crack cocaine dealers, the spread of crack cocaine and incidental crime related to crack cocaine addiction has been going down. This is a strikingly bad idea, and one that this Congress should emphatically reject. 
   The President's principal explanation for the proposal to lower crack sentences is that the move was recommended by the U.S. Sentencing Commission to address the disparity in treatment between crack and powder dealers. I agree we should reduce this disparity, which produces the unjust result that people higher on the drug chain get lighter sentences than those at the bottom. But going easier on crack peddlers--the dealers who infest our school yards and playgrounds--is not the solution. Crack is cheap and highly addictive. Tough crack sentences have encouraged many dealers to turn in their superiors in exchange for leniency. Lowering these sentences will remove that incentive and undermine our prosecutors, making them less effective at protecting our children and our neighborhoods. 
   No, there is a better way to bring crack and powder cocaine sentences more in line. Instead of lowering sentences for crack dealers, we should instead raise sentences for powder dealers. Doing so will accomplish every legitimate policy objective that can be advanced by the President's proposal--except greater leniency for these individuals, which in my view is not a legitimate policy objective. Raising sentences for powder dealers is accordingly what this amendment proposes to do. Specifically, it changes the quantity of powder cocaine necessary to trigger a mandatory 5-year minimum sentence from 500 grams to 50 grams, and makes a similar change in the amount necessary to trigger a mandatory 10-year sentence. 
   The effect of this will be to raise sentences substantially for those who deal in powder cocaine, a change that I think is entirely justified.  
   Even without taking into account the differential treatment of crack, powder sentences are currently too low. Powder is the raw material for crack. Yet sentences for powder dealers were set before the crack epidemic, without accounting for powder's role in causing it. It is also one of the drugs the use of which continues to increase, not only among teenagers but also among adults. 
   Moreover, we occasionally see a large powder supplier get a lower sentence than the low-level crack dealer who resold some powder in crack form simply because the powder dealer took the precaution of selling his product only in powder form. That is plainly an unjust result and one that our legal system should not countenance. 
   By making the changes in the quantity triggers for mandatory minimums I have described, our amendment will reduce the differential between the amount of powder and crack required to trigger a mandatory minimum sentence from 100 to 1, the current differential, to 10 to 1. That is the exact same ratio proposed by the administration in their proposal. But our proposal in this amendment will accomplish that goal not by making crack dealers' sentences more lenient but, rather, by toughening sentences for powder cocaine dealers. 
   Now the administration has charged--and we have heard a comment about this on the floor today; I suspect we will hear more--that the proposal we are offering is nevertheless the wrong way to proceed on account of its allegedly racially disparate impact. In my judgment, if the sentencing structure being proposed is in fact desirable on its merits, that is a dubious basis on which to evaluate the merits of this proposal or, for that matter, the administration's. 
   Since the administration has made this charge, I think it is important to understand it is not true. In fact, if our proposal is enacted, overall the percentage of cocaine dealers sentenced to tough, mandatory minimum sentences should be less disproportionately African American than it is under current law. This is because under current law and under the administration's proposal, persons convicted of dealing between 100 and 250 grams of powder are not subject to mandatory sentences. Under the proposal, they are contained in our amendment. 
   According to the Sentencing Commission statistics in the most recent year for which they were collected, for fiscal year 1996 the percentage of non-Hispanic whites in that group, 38.9 percent, was higher than the percentage of members in any other racial category. Therefore, imposing mandatory minimum sentences on this group of people would accordingly reduce the racially disparate impact of current law. Thus, the sentencing outcome under our proposal should have a less racially disparate impact than the current proposal which is in place in law. 
   By contrast, the administration's proposal to change the triggers for mandatory minimums for crack dealers is highly likely to increase the percentage of individuals sentenced to mandatory minimums for dealing cocaine who are African American. Had the administration's proposal been in effect during fiscal year 1996, the proportion of individuals sentenced to a mandatory 5-year minimum sentence who are African American would have increased--not decreased--increased slightly from 82.8 
   percent to 85.2 percent. Thus, contrary to the administration's charge, the proposal contained in this amendment will actually decrease the racially disparate effect of mandatory sentences on cocaine dealers. 
   On the other hand, what is not true of our proposal and is true of the administration's proposal is to change the quantity trigger for crack dealers. Their proposal will increase the racially disparate impact of mandatory minimum sentences for cocaine dealing compared to current law. 
   All that being said, I would like to get away from these numbers and talk about some of the contacts I have had with people in my State who are the victims of these drug dealers. Despite the disparity reduction justification given for the President's proposal, I have not found anyone in my State--any parents, regardless of their race, whose children have been touched by a crack cocaine dealer--who don't want to see the person responsible suffer serious consequences, no matter who the crack dealer was. Their families are already suffering consequences; their schoolyards are suffering consequences; their neighborhoods are suffering consequences. They believe that the people behind it, whether it is the peddler in the schoolyard or the kingpin selling the powder cocaine, ought to suffer the consequences, as well. 
   Reverend Eugene F. Rivers II, cochair of the National Ten Point Leadership Foundation in inner city Boston, says:  
   To confuse the concerns of crack dealers with the broader interests of the black community is at best inane and at worst immoral. Those who are straining to live in inner-city neighborhoods that are mostly adversely affected by the plight of crack and who witness crack's consequences first hand want crack dealers taken off the streets for the longest period of time possible.  
   We owe it to the thousands upon thousands of families struggling to protect their children from the scourge of drugs and drug violence. That means staying tough on those who peddle drugs and sending a clear message to our young people that we will not tolerate crack dealers in our neighborhoods or powder dealers who supply the crack dealers. 
   President Clinton had it right 3 years ago when he agreed with this Congress in rejecting an earlier Sentencing Commission plan to lower sentences for crack dealers. Back then, President Clinton said:  
   We have to send a constant message to our children that drugs are illegal, drugs are dangerous, drugs may cost your life, and the penalties for drug dealing are severe.  
   Unfortunately, President Clinton's new plan to reduce sentences for crack dealers does not live up to that obligation. It sends our kids exactly the wrong message, and it does not do any favor to anybody except drug peddlers. In contrast, the approach taken by our amendment is faithful to this obligation. It achieves a reduction in the disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentencing in the right way, through legislation making sentences for powder cocaine dealers a lot tougher. 
   At this crucial time, we may be making real progress in winning the war on drugs and violent crime in part because we have sent the message that crack gang membership is no way to live and that society will come down very hard on those spreading this pernicious drug. At the same time, our kids remain all too exposed to dangerous drugs, far more exposed than we can probably imagine. 
   In light of these two trends, it would be, in my opinion, catastrophic to let any drug dealer think that the cost of doing business is going down. This is especially no time for lowering sentences for dealing in crack, a pernicious drug that brought our cities great danger, violence, and grief. It will be nearly impossible, in my judgment, to succeed in discouraging our kids from using drugs if they hear we are lowering sentences for any category of drug dealers. 
   By adopting this amendment, we can send our kids the right message: We will not tolerate crack dealers in our neighbors, and we will make the sentences on powdered cocaine dealers a lot tougher. Success in the drug war depends upon all the efforts of parents, schools, churches, the medical communities, and local law enforcement community leaders. There is no doubt about that. They are doing a great job in the drug fight. The Federal Government must do its part, too. We must provide needed resources, and we must reinforce the message that drugs aren't acceptable and that drug dealers belong in prison for a long time. Our kids deserve no less. That is why I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   To address a couple of the points that were made by previous speakers, first, we have to concern ourselves not just with costs that are attendant to incarcerating crack cocaine dealers but with the costs that are brought about when those crack cocaine dealers are running wild in our communities. The notion that there are no costs involved when these folks remain on the streets, in our playgrounds and neighborhoods, addicting children, precipitating violence when the crack gangs are busy in their communities, is to miss, I think, a very vital part of this debate. 
   The costs of addiction are significant. Who exactly are the targets of the addiction? Very often, they are, themselves, members of minority communities. I don't think we are doing a  favor to the minority communities of this country if we allow the schoolyards in those communities to be infested with crack cocaine dealers. The key is, Do we want to rid our communities of drug dealers? In my judgment, that certainly ought to be our objective. That is what we have tried to do in this amendment, not just with the sections relating to powder cocaine sentences, for the dealers of powder cocaine, but the other provisions of the legislation. I am proud to be a cosponsor. 
   I hope my colleagues understand when they cast their vote on this issue, the question is very simple: Do you think it is time for powder cocaine dealers to serve tougher sentences for drug kingpins to go to jail for a longer time or don't you? That is what is at stake. If you believe in tougher sentences for powder cocaine dealers, we ask for your support for this amendment. 
   If you believe in getting tougher on methamphetamines, we ask for your support for this amendment. If you believe we should devote more resources to drug treatment programs, then you should vote for this amendment. But don't be fooled by claims that somehow or another we are doing anybody a favor by not moving forward in this area, and by letting drug dealers continue to infest our schoolyards. That is not doing any favors to anybody. I hope our colleagues will join us and support this amendment. 
   I yield the floor to the Senator from Colorado.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the amendment offered by the Senator from Utah, Mr. HATCH, Senator ASHCROFT, and myself. 
   I wish to be somewhat responsive to a few of the statements made in some of the speeches in opposition to this amendment, as they pertain specifically to the issue of changing the mandatory minimum sentences on dealing with powder cocaine. I think it is important that we reflect on how we got to where we are today. There has been for some time, as reflected in actions of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, concern about the disparity between the mandatory minimum sentences for crack cocaine triggers of 5-year mandatory minimums for the dealing of 5 grams, of 10 years for dealings of 10 grams, and the mandatory minimums for powder cocaine, which are 100 times greater with the 5-year mandatory minimum trigger at 500 grams and the 10-year trigger at 1,000. 
   The Sentencing Commission has tried on a couple occasions to address this issue. The first time they tried this we were forced to take action as a Congress to stop their proposal from going into effect. I remind my colleagues that we overwhelmingly voted, I believe unanimously voted, to say no to the proposal of addressing this disparity by simply changing the powder cocaine thresholds to the same as crack cocaine. We thought it was a big mistake to make the cost of doing business go down. 
   The President signed that legislation into law, making the very same statement, that the message we would be sending to young people, to drug dealers, to everybody, was the wrong message if we made crack cocaine sentences more lenient. 
   The Sentencing Commission came back with a second proposal--that was a proposal actually in response to a study we requested--that we would simultaneously make the crack cocaine mandatory minimum sentences more lenient while making powder tougher. The Sentencing Commission decided that a ratio of a 10-to-1 difference in the thresholds versus a 100-to-1 difference was the appropriate ratio. 
   A number of us found this second suggestion also unacceptable because,  once again, it would require making the sentences for crack cocaine dealers more lenient. I speak for myself, but I think others who cosponsored this legislation share the view that we should not be making drug sentences more lenient, particularly for crack cocaine dealers. 
   I want to talk about why we should not do that because the only way to change the disparity between powder cocaine mandatory minimums and crack cocaine mandatory minimums is either make the mandatory minimums for crack cocaine more lenient and the mandatory minimums for powder cocaine tougher or do a little of each. 
   I think anything that changes the crack cocaine mandatory minimum threshold is a mistake, for several reasons. First, the current mandatory minimum with respect to crack cocaine, the 5-gram threshold, to trigger a 5-year mandatory, has been a very effective device in terms of getting the lower end drug dealers to begin giving up to prosecutors up the drug chain so we can begin prosecuting people higher on the drug chain. If we make those mandatory minimums more lenient, if in fact the sentences being confronted by people at the bottom end of the drug chain aren't very severe, they are not going to cooperate. They are not going to provide the evidence or finger the higher-ups in the drug chain itself. 
   A second argument not to change the crack cocaine thresholds is that we have differences in a lot of States already between what the State mandatory minimums punishments are and the Federal mandatory minimum punishments are. 
   In Michigan, we have a pretty tough set of State laws, similar to the Federal laws. They are sufficiently similar so that if somebody is being pursued for crack cocaine dealing, they don't really gain anything by playing off the State versus the Federal law enforcement officials. But if we begin to make crack cocaine thresholds for mandatory minimum sentences more lenient, in Michigan, what is going to happen--and I predict in a lot of other States--is that the crack cocaine dealer is going to begin to make a deal with the Federal prosecutors, as opposed to the State prosecutors, to get the lighter sentence. I can't imagine that is what we want to do here in the Congress of the United States. 
   The third issue I think is important is to understand exactly how crack cocaine is sold. I have talked to people who are in our drug task forces in Michigan. They have pointed out that you really can't increase the thresholds very much beyond 5 grams because people don't walk around with larger quantities of crack cocaine in their possession when they are dealing. They hide their stuff, and they deal in quantities smaller than 5 grams or slightly greater than 5 grams. If you change that as 
   significantly as has been proposed by the Sentencing Commission, if you make the thresholds more lenient, you are not going to find anybody carrying around or being apprehended with sufficient levels of crack cocaine to be pursued under the mandatory minimum structure. 
   Fourth, if we make the sentences for crack cocaine more lenient, we are going to be sending a terrible message as well as providing incentive for people to pursue crack dealing in greater amounts. Do we really want to send the message to young people that we are getting less tough on crack cocaine dealers? Do we want to send the message to crack dealers that the cost of doing business just got cheaper? Do we want to tell the families that we want to, in fact, make it harder to pursue, prosecute, and ultimately confine and incarcerate crack cocaine dealers who are in their neighborhoods, their schoolyards and playgrounds, selling dope to their kids? Is that the message we want to send? I hope not. 
   Finally, of course, as we know, crack is both cheaper and more addictive than cocaine in powder form. That is the reason there is a disparity to begin with, much the same as between heroin and opium. 
   For all these reasons, it does not make a lot of sense to make the mandatory minimum threshold for 5-year or 10-year sentences for dealing in crack cocaine more lenient. If you rule out the notion of making crack cocaine sentences more lenient, then the only other way to address the disparity between powder and crack cocaine is to make the powder cocaine sentences tougher. 
   So if people are on the other side of this issue and want to simultaneously make the disparity between crack and powder closer, lower that disparity, and oppose this amendment, then the only thing they can be saying is they want to make sentences for crack cocaine dealers more lenient. I can't believe many Members of this body want to do that. That is the only option we have. That is why we have pursued an option that will reduce the disparity by making sentences for powder cocaine dealers tougher. 
   What we have done in setting the standard we have chosen in this amendment is to use the ratio that was agreed upon by the Sentencing Commission in their proposal, and by the administration, of a 10-to-1 ratio between the triggers of mandatory minimum sentences for crack dealers and for powder dealers. But we have reduced the disparity from 100-to-1 to 10-to-1 by making tougher sentences for powder cocaine dealers--the change in our proposal. 
   I want to address two or three other points that were made in some of the earlier speeches. First, we have heard talk about the cost of incarceration. I addressed this earlier in my first speech because I get frustrated when I hear people talking about how much it costs to keep crack dealers and drug dealers out of the playgrounds and neighborhoods of our communities. The impression is that the only cost on which we should focus is exclusively the cost of incarceration. But what is the cost to us as a society and of having larger numbers of children becoming addicted to crack cocaine, having these people not in prison but in our neighborhoods? What about those costs? Can we possibly equate the cost of someone who dies as a result of their drug addiction or kills somebody in pursuit of the resources to be able to meet their drug addiction? What are the costs of that? 
   So I think it is a little bit unfair to only add up the costs on one side of this equation. I think we should also be talking about the costs to our communities of allowing larger numbers of drug dealers to avoid sentencing and to stay in business. 
   The other point I make, as I did earlier today, is that we have seen a dramatic reduction in the last few years in both the number of murders and robberies and other numbers of violent crimes across the board in our country, in city after city. Those with expertise on this issue have consistently cited that the reason for these declines in the murder rates, the rates of armed robbery, and so on, is the effectiveness with which we are finally beginning to address the crack cocaine epidemic in America. 
   So, Mr. President, the notion that we would do anything that would reverse our course with regard to cracking down on the dealers of crack seems to me to be a mistake. 
   Finally, I say our goal should be to lower the disparity so that more people up the drug chain are subject to mandatory minimum sentences. That is a good reason, in my judgment, by itself, to make tougher the threshold for mandatory minimum thresholds for the sale of powder cocaine. 
   In addition, by doing that, we will reduce this disparity that exists. I believe if we accomplish both objectives, we will make a greater impact on our fight against drugs in this country. But our colleagues should make no mistake about the fact that if we don't take this approach and want to reduce this disparity, their only option is to make the sentences for crack dealers lighter and more lenient. I don't believe the Members of this Chamber want to go on record as saying they want to move in that direction. So we have offered an amendment that constructively addresses the disparity without making crack sentences more lenient. 
   I think the other components of this amendment are also good--those that deal with methamphetamines, the increased amount of support for drug treatment programs, and the variety of other components of this amendment. 
   I say, finally, with respect to the question of why it should be in the bankruptcy bill, there are a lot of issues that were agreed upon when we moved to the bankruptcy legislation that were going to be included in the debate here, the so-called nongermane  amendments, ranging from amendments dealing with East Timor, to agriculture, and so on, and this amendment as well. Perhaps this isn't the ideal spot for this debate. I only say that was the agreement that was reached by 100 Senators, 
   that we would have amendments that were not specifically germane to bankruptcy as part of the final bill we will deal with on the floor this year. 
   I hope those who argue somehow that we shouldn't be dealing with this issue will be equally vocal in complaining about the insertion of other less germane issues in the bankruptcy debate because clearly we are going to hear it argued from both sides that some of the issues are inappropriate in this context. The fact is, I think the American people want us to take a tough stand on drugs and want us to take a tough stand in favor of tough drug sentences. Our amendment accomplishes that. I sincerely hope our colleagues will join us in supporting its passage. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the late Frederick Alber of Lapeer County, MI. On November 13, 1999, the community of Oregon Township will dedicate a new headstone for Mr. Alber and also honor other veterans buried in the Oregon Township Cemetery. 
   Frederick Alber enlisted in the Seventeenth Michigan Infantry on July 2, 1862 at age 24 and served valiantly during the Civil War. On July 30, 1896, Private Alber was issued the Medal of Honor for his undaunted bravery in the wilderness and his heroic actions at Spotsylvania. On May 12, 1864, Private Alber rescued Lieutenant Charles Todd of the 17th Michigan Infantry who was in the hands of a party of rebels. Private Alber shot down one enemy rebel and knocked over another with the butt of his musket. He then took the rebels as prisoners and conducted them both to the rear of the formation. 
   The Civil War is one of the most important events in our nation's history. Thanks to the brave actions of soldiers like Frederick Alber, we are a united, free country. It is only fitting that we remember the great sacrifices made by those who have gone before us. The marker dedication at Frederick Alber's grave site is a meaningful way to remember and honor the past heroes of our country and is an appropriate manner in which to salute our cherished liberties. 
   I join the entire community of Oregon Township and Lapeer County as they pay their respects to a real American hero, Frederick Alber.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for this important amendment. Without touching Social Security, it would provide significant assistance to millions of Americans struggling economically even during this time of sustained growth. 
   I believe this amendment demonstrates my party's continuing commitment to fostering economic growth and helping those in need. And we should not forget that, despite recent economic good times, there are many Americans who remain in economic need. 
   African-American youths continue to suffer from an unemployment rate  three times that of white youths. Hispanic youths suffer from an unemployment rate ten points higher than that of whites. And 8 million American families continue to live in poverty. 
   We can do better. We can do better. 
   I believe this amendment constitutes an important step forward in our drive to unleash the entrepreneurial energies of the American people; energies that can lift individuals out of poverty as they push communities to higher levels of prosperity. 
   This amendment contains an important provision of the Renewal Alliance package I have been working toward since coming to the United States Senate. It also contains a number of other provisions that I believe represent the responsible way to raise the minimum wage: by ensuring that businesses do not find themselves saddled with costs that lead them to lay off minimum wage workers, exactly those proponents of a minimum wage hike are trying to assist. 
   This amendment addresses three major areas of concern to Americans striving to work their way into our vast middle class: work opportunity, investment, and health insurance. 
   First, as to work opportunity. In my view opportunity is the key to progress. I have sought to increase this opportunity through the Renewal Alliance, a bipartisan group of Senators seeking targeted tax benefits to spur economic growth in our nation's distressed urban and rural communities. This amendment contains key provisions of the Renewal Alliance program. 
   Most important is a provision to permanently extend the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. A credit of up to $2,400 for wages paid would provide businesses with extra funds for investment in growth and employee training. As a result, many Americans currently without bright futures will receive experience and training--the keys, in my view, to economic success. 
   Also critical to providing increased work opportunity are provisions in this amendment that encourage greater investment, and greater investment in small businesses in particular. 
   Mr. President, 99 percent of American employers are small businesses. Small businesses employ more than half our private work force, and they have consistently been the engine of our economic growth, whether in traditional industries or on the cutting edge of high technology. 
   Further, Mr. President, it is often small business owners who are willing to take a chance on someone in need--someone without experience, someone who has fallen on hard times. 
   If they are to employ more Americans who are in need, Mr. President, our small businesses must have access to more investment capital. This amendment would addresses our continuing shortage of investment, thereby spurring small business growth and hiring. 
   First, it would increase the maximum dollar amount small businesses can deduct for investment in business property. By increasing this amount to $30,000, beginning in 2001, the amendment would provide an additional $3,850 in annual tax savings for small businesses investing in new equipment. 
   Second, the amendment would provide more than 50 provisions encouraging investment in pensions. They would expand coverage, enhance fairness for women, increase portability, strengthen security and reduce regulatory burdens. 
   Finally, this amendment would addresses inequities in our tax structure that keep an estimated 44 million Americans from affording health insurance. 44 million is a distressing number. Equally distressing is the fact that fully 81 percent of uninsured Americans have jobs. 
   Too many Americans, including the self-employed, the unemployed, and employees of small companies that do not provide health insurance, can't afford coverage. Why not? Because, under our tax code, they must pay taxes first, and buy insurance with whatever they have left over--if anything. 
   Paying with after-tax dollars can make health insurance twice as expensive--too expensive for millions of working Americans. 
   We must address this inequity in our tax code. This amendment would do just that. 
   First, it would enable self-employed Americans to deduct the full cost of health insurance. Finally, entrepreneurs would get the same tax benefits as larger companies. 
   Second, this amendment would provide an above-the-line deduction for individuals whose employers do not subsidize more than 50% of the cost of health coverage. Thus all workers, not just those who itemize, would be better able to afford health care costs. 
   Taken together, these provisions would provide significantly greater economic opportunity for all Americans. They would safeguard our economic growth and spur further investment in American workers. 
   I urge my colleagues to give this important amendment their full support.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on two pieces of legislation designed to protect the habitat of this continent's migratory birds. Both H.R. 2454, known as the ``Snow Goose'' bill, and S. 148, the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act are intended to protect bird habitat, and by extension, the species which frequent these lands. 
   At the Senate markup last month, Senator Chafee combined these two bills in the hopes of passing them as a complete package this year. Unfortunately, it has become obvious that this strategy will not work because some Members of the House, lacking a better vehicle, intend to use the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act as a tool for debating the merits of property rights legislation. Apparently, they do not care that in doing so they jeopardize the passage of both bills. 
   I want very much for the Congress to pass the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act and am disappointed that the House has failed to even bring this issue to the floor. It is an important bill that will help ensure that the migratory species which Americans enjoy will receive additional protection in their winter habitats.  
   But the Snow Goose is equally important and it is imperative that the Congress Act on this legislation as soon as possible. I fear the refusal of the House to act on S. 148 jeopardizes the chances of the Snow Goose legislation this year. For that reason, I have offered an amendment to H.R. 2454 to strip the language pertaining to the neotropicals from the text of the Snow Goose bill. 
   As part of my agreeing to do this, I have been assured by both the Chairman of the House Resources Committee and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Fisheries Conservation, Wildlife and Oceans that they will do everything they can to assure that the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act is considered by the full House early next year. I am encouraged by their support and wish to thank them for their willingness to try to move this legislation. 
   Therefore, I believe that removing the text of the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act is only a short-term setback. I am confident that once the full House has the opportunity to consider this legislation that a good bill will emerge from that respected body. I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 2454, as amended.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President I rise today to honor and congratulate St. Joseph's Mercy of Macomb Hospital as they gather in celebration of their 100th Anniversary. 
   St. Joseph's Mercy of Macomb has set a pioneering tradition in health care since it was founded in 1899. One year after its beginning, the hospital opened a 50 bed facility for treatment of the acutely ill. With its healing waters and mineral baths it attracted patients world wide. St. Joseph's Mercy continued to take great strides in healthcare by establishing a disabled children's clinic, physical therapy department and the area's first alcoholism treatment center which was one of the first to recognize mental illness as a disease. Continuing to provide the best quality of healthcare for the people of Macomb County, in 1990 St. Joseph's became partners with Mercy Health systems and Henry Ford Health System. 
   What is truly remarkable about the people involved in St. Joseph's Mercy is the commitment they have to removing barriers to better health and making services available close to home for people of all ages. St. Joseph's Mercy has become a strong force in the community--working with parishes and schools to create healthcare teams and reaching out with HomeCare and neighborhood based healthcare centers. St. Joseph's Mercy is working hard to plan for the future of healthcare needs with critical, life saving initiatives and community outreach activities all designed to create a healthier Macomb County. 
   The accomplishments this group has made in the past 100 years are to be commended. St. Joseph's Mercy has made a hospital much more than four walls filled with medical equipment. They have taken their guiding spirit and reached out to the community delivering a century of caring and charity. 
   It is my hope that the St. Joseph's Mercy of Macomb will continue to provide excellent healthcare that knows no bounds.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to show appreciation and honor to Daniel Jacob Miller as he receives the Heroism Award presented by the Boy Scouts of America. Daniel is a true hero, good Samaritan and model citizen. On December 31, 1998, there was a tragic and massive automobile pile-up in Northern Michigan. The lone police officer on the scene needed help and that is when Dan stepped up. The officer asked if anyone had medical training and Dan, who had learned first aid training through the Boy Scouts, immediately offered his assistance. Dan's unselfish acts, putting his own life at risk helped save the lives of a mother and her children and enabled the police officer to tend to the many other seriously injured motorists. 
   What is most exceptional about Dan is that he genuinely cares about all people and their well being. After the devastating tornados which struck Oklahoma last May, Dan instigated and helped organize a trip to aid in the disaster clean-up. Dan's leadership was also apparent when he taught fellow Boy Scouts how to operate a Ham Radio and assisted them in getting certified in Ham Radio operations in case of a disaster. 
   Dan is described as a quiet and reserved person who enjoys doing his good deeds in secret and throughout his life he has continually put others' needs before his own. Daniel Miller is an exemplary person, Boy Scout and citizen. Time and time again his devotion and good will have blessed the lives of numerous people. It is my hope that many more people follow the path that Dan has set himself on and continue to make the state of Michigan and our nation a better place. 
   I would also like to take this opportunity to commend the Boy Scouts of America for their dedication to teaching young people the skills they need to assist in life-saving situations. The Boy Scout leaders who so unselfishly give of their time to help young men could never understand the far reaches of their work. Daniel Miller gives us one incredible example of the importance of the training young men get through the Boy Scouts of America.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, It is my great pleasure to recognize and honor the Downriver Guidance Clinic as they celebrate their First Downriver Guidance Clinic Week November 7 through November 13, 1999.  
   For forty-one years the Downriver Guidance Clinic has been at the forefront of providing exceptional health care, mental health services and support to those people who are in need. The Downriver Guidance Clinic has enhanced the quality of life for children, adults and families in the Downriver community. Their programs have built foundations of support for children with behavioral problems, first time parents, teenage mothers, and adults who need help coping with unexpected changes in life. 
   What is truly remarkable about the Downriver Guidance Center are the innovative and progressive programs they provide. The Opportunity Center combines traditional therapy, volunteer mentoring, and other activities to assist young people who need extra help interacting with parents, teachers and peers. Their Center for Excellence focuses on evaluating and assessing programs as a means for improved services. The Downriver Guidance Center programs continue to reach out to the community by providing employment programs that help ease chronically unemployed people into the workforce. The Center also provides an early childhood development which encourages good emotional and physical health ensuring that children enter school ready to learn. 
   The accomplishments and work of the Downriver Guidance Center are to be commended. Their impact on the Downriver Community of the future is immeasurable. I applaud the Downriver Guidance Center for all the help they give others as they strive to meet the ever changing needs of the community they serve.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce my resolution which would recognize August 1st, 2000 as ``National Relatives as Parents Day.'' 
   Mr. President, last year the state of Michigan and its Governor, John Engler, declared August 1, 1999, as Relatives Raising Relative Children Day in order to recognize the enduring and valuable contributions of those individuals willing to raise relative children as their own sons and daughters. I believe that we should follow the example set by my home State and recognize all of our relatives raising relatives. 
   Mr. President, my resolution declaring August 1, 2000 as ``National Relatives as Parents Day'' provides the perfect opportunity to recognize and honor the dedication and compassion of relatives who willingly take on the often thankless responsibility of providing a relative child in need of a family and home. 
   Mr. President, there is little doubt that children are our Nation's most valuable resource. They are, quite literally, America's future. And, it is our most important responsibility as lawmakers and as citizens to protect and care for our most vulnerable charges. 
   Mr. President, there is also little doubt that the family plays a vital and irreplaceable role in providing young children with the secure and caring environment necessary to teach them the values integral to leading a happy, healthy and productive life. Mr. President, it is within the family that children best receive the special care and attention necessary for their proper development. 
   Unfortunately, not all children grow up in a healthy home environment. Too many children will suffer from child abuse or neglect, poor nutrition and insufficient child care, all of which jeopardize the well-being of a young child and his or her opportunity for a fulfilling and successful adulthood. Sadly, in the event that the family unit breaks down, the child cannot remain in his or her existing home situation. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to note that there are many individuals willing to open their hearts and homes to children whose families are in crisis. These special people play an indispensable role in helping children heal--providing children with a stable and secure environment in which they can grow and develop into successful adults. 
   Mr. President, approximately 520,000 children live with foster families--about 150,800, or 29 percent, of whom are children living with relatives who are willing to take in relative children, providing them with guidance and a caring and positive home environment. It is in honor of these individuals that I stand today, for without their selflessness, many of the close to 160,000 children would either remain in unhealthy and unsafe environments or be uprooted and placed in temporary group homes. Relatives who take on the responsibility of parents deserve special recognition for their long-lasting contributions to their children and to the larger community. 
   It is my hope that all of my colleagues will join with me in recognition of all of this country's relatives, who as parents, have had an incalculable positive impact in the lives of young children in need of a family and home.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, recently the Senate passed the last of the Fiscal Year 2000 appropriations bills, the Labor, Health & Human Services, Education appropriations bill. Despite tight budgetary constraints, the Senate has passed a bill which embodies the basic principles of our democratic society--all of our citizens deserve an equal opportunity to reach one's highest potential--by providing access to a good education, jobs skills training and protection from illness. 
   While I believe that this is a well balanced bill which appropriately reflects the priorities of the Senate, many of the votes that we cast in relation to the this bill challenged these priorities as well as our commitment to protecting the Social Security surplus from careless government over-spending. Therefore, please allow me to address some of the specifics of individual amendments which touch upon these issues. 
   As I stated before, this legislation rightly embodies the ideals of responsibility, accountability and flexibility. No greater are these ideals highlighted than in the areas of education. This legislation provides for $37.6 billion for the Department of Education; $6 billion for special education; and $892 million in education impact aid. In fact, the Committee exceeded the President's funding level requests by $537 million, $586 million and $156 million respectively. This support will provide the foundation by which we can continue to strengthen and improve the education system for all of our children. 
   In addition, this legislation respects the right of the states and local districts to make appropriate decisions regarding education. 
   However, some of my colleagues would jeopardize the jurisdiction of states, schools and parents to decide the most appropriate means by which to address the specific concerns of their children. 
   Senator MURRAY offered an amendment (No. 1804) which would have increased the levels for the class-size reduction program from $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. This increase would be coupled to a mandate which requires that the funding must be used to reduce class size. Now, I agree that smaller class size is preferable to a larger class-size, just about anyone would; children receive more individual attention from the teacher when there are fewer children in the classroom. However, not all schools have the need for smaller class-sizes--42 states have already met the goal of 18 students per teacher. Thus, not all districts place priority on smaller class-sizes. Why would the federal government force districts and states to spend limited resources on a program which is unnecessary? What right does the federal government have to decide for the schools and the parents what their priorities should be? Forcing schools to spend funding on one particular program, simply takes valuable resources from other programs which might better address the needs of their students. Although this amendment failed, the funding itself is still available to schools; to reduce the number of children in each classroom if they so choose or, if further class-size  reduction is unnecessary, to fund a more appropriate program such as technology-related training for teachers, dropout or drug abuse prevention programs and building new school facilities. 
   It is for similar reasons that I could not support an amendment (No. 1809) to increase funding for 21st Century Community Learning Centers. Again, I do not doubt that after-school programs offer structural, educational, and health services to children and the families of communities. However, the funding for this program had already been increased $200 million over FY99 funding levels by the Committee. I cannot justify forcing states and localities to spend additional funding on specific programs which might not be appropriate for their communities. 
   As we continue to raise the bar on the quality of education provided to our children, we have also increased state and local accountability for reaching these high standards. Accountability is a key component of a successful education policy, without it there is less incentive to succeed or exceed goals. Earlier this session, we passed the Education Flexibility Partnership Act (Public Law 106-25), which in exchange for greater accountability, provides states with expanded flexibility to choose which education initiatives best fit the needs of their children. In the five years the Ed-Flex program was in effect, prior to its expansion to all states with the passage of this bill, it has realized modest to spectacular results, and in no case has performance declined or has a state abused its increased flexibility by diverting or misrepresenting funds. I am proud to have voted for Ed-Flex and the principles it upholds. 
   Unfortunately, some of my colleagues, while espousing the virtues of accountability, would at the same time take away the flexibility states need to respond quickly and effectively to the needs of their students and schools. This is why I opposed an amendment (No. 1861) offered by Senator BINGAMAN, which purported to increase accountability for states. This 
   amendment undermined the principles of responsibility, accountability and flexibility. While the amendment would increase funding for disadvantaged students by $49 million, it specifically mandated that $70 million in funding must be used for state accountability programs. This represents a net loss of $21 million in funding which could have gone directly to the classrooms--funding which could have directly and positively impacted the quality of education provided for economically disadvantaged students. This amendment represents accountability, or at least requires the implementation of an accountability program, without the accompanying flexibility states need to effectively address education issues. 
   Mr. President, there is another side to responsibility as well. Earlier this year, we made a promise to the American people that we would not raid the Social Security surplus. Even as the President's budget proposal threatened drain the Social Security surplus by $158 billion over five years and the Democrats continued to filibuster my Social Security Lockbox legislation, we still held true to our commitment not to spend a single penny of the Social Security trust fund. Now, as we are nearing the end of the appropriations process, it is vital that we uphold our responsibility to the American people and keep this promise. 
   Senator NICKLES offered an amendment (No. 1889) which rightly expressed the sense of the Senate regarding the importance of protecting the Social Security surplus. Recognizing the possibility that the amount of funding appropriated through the 13 appropriations bills could exceed budgetary restraints, the Senate agreed that a solution could be an across-the-board reduction in discretionary funding in an amount equal to that needed to stay within budget constraints, thereby protecting Social Security. My vote reflects my unwavering belief that the social security surplus must be protected from wanton government spending. It also highlights my continuing opposition to rasing taxes on America's working families, especially when cutting wasteful Washington spending is certainly a viable alternative. 
   Some of my colleagues, many of whom are the same individuals who have continued to vote against a Social Security Lockbox, denounced the across-the-board proposal. Although they could have offered a substantial and realistic alternative to across-the-board reductions in reductions, instead they choose to introduce an amendment (No. 2267) which merely denounces the proposal for a reduction in discretionary funding and offers vague support for paying for the budget shortfall by raising taxes and using other offsets. 
   When my colleagues were pressed about details, they stated that there is currently $4 trillion in tax expenditures which could be examined and possibly eliminated to raise revenue for excess spending: that ``there may very well be an opportunity to squeeze some resources out of tax expenditures.*.*.*''. Another term for tax expenditure is tax relief. And when my colleagues talk about squeezing out resources, this includes ``squeezing'' relief measures such as the tax credit for post-secondary education, the $500 per child tax credit, estate tax relief and the home interest deduction, among many other provisions which allow families to save and invest in their own and their children's futures. Without a clear explanation of exactly how enough revenue would be raised to fill the budget shortfall, thereby avoiding spending the Social Security surplus, I could not support the alternative amendment to the across-the-board reduction in discretionary spending levels and I will not support any proposal which would increase the already excessive tax burden on American families. 
   In addition, some of my colleagues offered an amendment (No. 2268) which would reduce the level of fairness inherent in an across-the-board reduction by insisting on an exemption for specific programs from the resulting decreases in discretionary funding, specifically education funding. While I believe that education is a top national priority, this amendment primarily highlights a general lack of understanding about the actual education funding levels in this appropriations bill. 
   My votes on these Sense of the Senate amendments simply express my preference for spending reductions versus raising taxes or spending the Social Security surplus. In that there are many specific areas of federal spending that in my view can and should be cut back, I would prefer to see us balance the budget with reductions of that type. Unfortunately, gaining consensus on such reductions will be difficult, although I will continue to press for this type of approach. Failing that, some type of across-the-board reductions may be the last resort. 
   As I mentioned earlier, the education funding in this bill exceeds the levels requested by the Administration on many fronts. While it is impossible at this point to know exactly what the final spending level will be at the end of the day, even after including all of the President's emergency spending and a possible Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) pay-back bill, an across-the-board reduction, designed to protect Social Security, would result in approximately a 1.4 percent decrease. 
   Mr. President, even with a 1.4 percent reduction in discretionary funding, I would further note that special education and education impact aid would have funding levels $521 million and $143 million above the President's request levels, respectively. In addition, the Department of Education would be funded $10.6 million over that which the President requested. Far from under-funding education, this bill continues to provide strong support for our schools and our students. 
   We have almost completed our appropriations work this year, and I applaud the effort and dedication demonstrated by my colleagues on the Senate Appropriations Committee and in the Senate as whole. I hope, as we go into the final stages of this process, we will continue to abide by the ideals of responsibility, accountability and flexibility by upholding our promise to protect Social Security and by producing a final package which will serve Americans well. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deepest condolences to the family of the slain Prime Minister of Armenia, Vazgen Sargsian, and the other assassinated leaders of the Armenian Parliament who were tragically killed in the brutal attack on the Armenian Parliament on October 27, 1999. My thoughts and prayers are also with the people of Armenia and the Armenian community around the world and in the United States. 
   The tragic turn of events that took place earlier this week should not be viewed as an impediment to the on-going positive trends the world has seen in Armenia. Indeed, Armenia has proven its commitment to a democratic future in its recent elections which were deemed free and fair by international election monitors. They have also made substantial progress on the peace process regarding Nagorno Karabakh. 
   The United States is enjoying a growing and mutually beneficial relationship with Armenia. Our focus should be on our continued support of the Armenian people. We must not allow the recent terrorist activity to eschew our dedication in helping Armenia achieve the highest form of freedom, liberty, and opportunity. To reaffirm our commitment to the progress embodied by the fallen Armenian patriots not only should be our goal, but our duty as a global leader. 
   For this reason, I ask to submit a resolution that condemns the terrorist activities that took the lives of the Armenian Prime Minister, Vazgen Sargsian, and other leaders of the Armenian Parliament, and pledges continued alliance between our two countries. Our thoughts are with the families, friends and loved ones of those affected by this tragedy, and we send our hope that those who perpetrated this horrible act will be brought to justice. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. I will speak briefly with respect to the passing of our dear colleague, John Chafee. He was a great friend to all Members, those who had the chance to work with him closely across the board from one side of the Chamber to the other. I think all felt the highest degree of respect and admiration for him. Today I want to express to his family my deepest condolences and those of my family. 
   A lot of great things have already been said about John Chafee's remarkable career both in public service and in service of his country, his academic achievements, as well as his professional achievements. I will have many memories of him. Probably one that will be the most vivid in a certain way is something I took note of after reading a book about the Korean war which talked about John Chafee. The book made reference to his very distinguishable way of walking, the sort of commanding stride with which he moved among the troops. After I read that, I started noticing the way he walked from one building to another of the Senate, and I noticed the same absolutely distinguishable stride with which he carried himself; somebody who was in command, somebody who moved purposefully forward to meetings, to the floor of the Senate, to attain the objectives which he had for his State and his country. 
   Certainly, anyone who had the chance to work with him, whether in the context of the issues that came before the Finance Committee or the Committee on Environment and Public Works, knows he brought to the Senate a great sense of dedication, commitment, integrity, and principle. We worked together quite a bit last go-round on the highway transportation bill. I remember on numerous occasions appearing in his office to make the plea for my State of Michigan. While he didn't have the ability to provide each and every Member with everything we wanted, he certainly put the time in to make sure he did the best for all of us in our States. That was his way of addressing all the things that came before him. 
   It will be hard to move forward without him because we will all miss him, and I think as a collective chamber we will miss his leadership. 
   As I said to his family and those close to him, I offer both my condolences but, at the same time, I express how much admiration I had for him and how I hope all Members can draw from our experiences with Senator Chafee some insights into how to make sure we conduct ourselves as Senators, with integrity and with the willingness and ability to work together to achieve great things. He certainly achieved many great things in his career, and I hope other Members can come close in our careers to achieving what he did.

   I want to acknowledge, while he is still on the floor, the continuing interest that I have in trying to work to a resolution on this issue because I think it is one, as is evidenced by the bipartisan nature of both the original bill and the proposed substitute, where there are, in fact, Members on both sides of the aisle who have an interest in proceeding in this area. So I hope we will be able to reach some kind of an agreement soon. 
   I have a little bit more I want to say about the legislation before we adjourn, but I thank the Senator from Nevada for his expression of a continuing interest to work together.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, we originally introduced this legislation, which is entitled ``The Millennium Digital Commerce Act'' on March 25. I introduced it with Senators WYDEN, MCCAIN, and BURNS. 
   The Senate Commerce Committee held a hearing on the legislation May 27. Subsequently, the legislation passed unanimously by the Senate Commerce Committee on June 23. 
   President Clinton's administration indicated a statement of support. That was issued on August 4. 
   I think that sequence of events suggest that there is a strong degree of support for this type of legislation. 
   The same week the President expressed his support, we attempted to pass the bill in the Senate by unanimous consent. That was just before the August recess. 
   Concerns were raised by two Members of the Senate about the possible impact of this bill on consumer protection. 
   Since that time, we have worked to try to incorporate some of the changes and some of those considerations into the legislation to address consumer protection concerns while still providing the tremendous benefit of electronic signatures to the 
   public which was intended by the legislation. I believe the substitute which we would propose to offer does just that. 
   As was the case with the legislation which passed the Senate Commerce Committee, the substitute will promote electronic commerce by providing a consistent framework for electronic signatures in transactions across all 50 States. 
   That framework is simply a guarantee of legal standing in each of those States. Such a guarantee will provide the certainty which today is lacking and will encourage the development and the use of electronic signature technology by both businesses and consumers. 
   The legislation addresses the concerns raised by the use of electronic records and electronic transactions. It will allow people to secure loans on line for the purchase of a car, home repair, or even a new mortgage by giving both companies and consumers the legal certainty they need. 
   However, the bill now includes safeguards to guarantee that electronic records will be provided in a form that accurately reflects the original transaction and which can be reproduced later. These safeguards are taken directly from the completed version of the Electronic Transactions Act, the ETA. 
   This legislation also recognizes that there are some areas of State law which should not be preempted. These are specifically spelled out and excluded in this bill. They include but are not limited to wills, codicils, matters of family law, and documents of title. 
   As almost anyone in this country knows who has paid the slightest degree of attention to developments in the areas of sales, or economy, or the markets, or watches their television and follows the commercials to the slightest degree, we are entering an age in which electronic commerce is rapidly serving as a substitute for traditional means of commercial activity.  
   Many individuals and companies, as well as others who wish to engage in electronic commerce and other electronic exchanges, are suffering because there is no uniform supporting legal infrastructure in the United States which could provide legal certainty for electronic agreements. 
   The problem is simple. We have about 42 States that have adopted their own basic version of how to authenticate documents that are entered into through electronic transmission. They are all different. Because of those differences, the potential exists for transactions and contracts entered into online through electronic commerce to be challenged in court because the laws of one State might be different from the laws in another. We wish to end that problem. 
   The States are moving as fast as they can to address it through a uniform act which has been developed by the States. And slowly but surely we believe that act will be adopted by State legislatures and signed into law by Governors. But until the States get to that point, we need an interim solution so that electronic commerce can continue to expand and people can continue to engage in electronic commercial activity. 
   The current and prospective patchwork of law and regulation cannot support, and in some cases is incompatible with, the e-commerce market's demanding requirements that are flowing from the interstate and international nature of Internet commerce. 
   The uncertainty and certainly the existence of all these different State laws provides a lot of uncertainty, and the resulting risks that stem from that harm America's businesses and consumers because it puts a limit on the amount of commercial activity that is capable of being handled in this fashion. 
   I think it further hinders the broad deployment of many innovative products and services by American companies, and, of course, in turn limits the choices for those who are prospective consumers, whether it is in business-to-business transactions, or business-to-consumer transactions. 
   The point is this legislation cannot continue to wait. We have tried on several occasions already to bring it to the floor. We tried to pass it through unanimous consent agreements. We have tried to negotiate. So far we have been unsuccessful. 
   The concepts and the goals behind this move toward electronic commerce and authentication are not a subject of controversy. Obsolete statutes that exist in State law should not be permitted to bar innovation and economic growth. 
   This is no longer a States rights issue because we are dealing with otherwise enforceable contracts involving interstate commerce. Thus, passing legislation that contains crucial provisions providing interstate commerce certainty for electronic agreements, in my judgment, and I believe in the judgment of a lot of others, should be a top priority for the Congress before leaving this year. 
   The legislation which we are talking about has been endorsed by numerous organizations and companies who are trying to expand e-commerce in our country. 
   They are: 
   America Online, American Bankers Association, American Council of Life Insurance, American Electronics Association, American Financial Services Association, American Insurance Association, Business Software Alliance, Charles Schwab, Chase Manhattan Bank, Citicorp, Coalition of Service Industries, Consumer Bankers Association, Consumer Mortgage Coalition, Digital Signature Trust Co., DLJ Direct, Electronic Check Clearing House, Electronic Industries Alliance, Equifax, Fidelity, and Ford Motor. 
   Also, the Financial Services Roundtable, Gateway2000, General Electric Company, GTE, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Information Technology Association of America, Information Technology Industry Council, Intel, International Biometric Industry Association, Internet Consumers Organization, Intuit, Investment Company Institute (ICI), Jackson National Life, Keybank, Microsoft, National Association of Manufacturers, National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, National Retail Federation, NCR Corporation, New York Clearing House Association L.L.C., PenOp Inc., Securities Industry Association, Telecommunications Industry Association, U.S. Bancorp, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Wachovia Corporation, Zions First National Bank, and Zurich Financial Services Group. 
   The fact that the legislation passed the Commerce Committee unanimously, the fact the President has endorsed it, should be a signal to everybody that this is legislation that does have the kind of bipartisan backing that should allow it to move fairly quickly through the Senate. Yet it is not. It has been since June that we have tried to do this. We have yet to have a successful completion of our efforts. 
   There are many issues involved in electronic authentication that can wait for the market to mature for resolution. Contractual certainty cannot. The absence of certainty with respect to electronic authentication contracts creates a huge impediment to the development of e-commerce both here and internationally. 
   Before I finish on this issue, I am still very much interested in working with people who have objections. I hope we can work something out in the next day or two, but I do think we need action this year. If we can't work something out in the next day or two, it will certainly be my intention to ask the majority leader to see if we can't file a cloture motion on a motion to proceed to this legislation so we can work it out. It seems to me if people have substantive differences we ought to be able to enter into a consent agreement to afford the opportunity for a limited number of amendments on this legislation so those differences can be worked out on the floor. To hold the bill up and prevent proceeding to the bill jeopardizes our ability to get anything done this year. I appeal to those who raised objections to work with Members in the next day or two to find an amicable as well as hopefully a fairly quick process by which we can bring the legislation through the Senate.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on the 13th of October, I was proud to cosponsor S. 1500, the Medicare Beneficiary Access to Quality Nursing Home Care Act of 1999. When Congress worked with the President to craft and pass the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, it included a number of desperately needed cost-saving measures to ensure that Medicare did not go bankrupt. At the time, Medicare was projected to be bankrupt by 2001 with annual costs rising at three times the rate of inflation. 
   However, the Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees the administration of Medicare, has far exceeded the scope of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, and gone beyond the intent of Congress in scaling back health care provider reimbursements. Driven by a philosophy that the Federal Government knows best how to handle your health care decisions, this administration has uniformly adopted policies that limit Medicare beneficiary choice, obstruct critically needed market-based reforms, and relentlessly pursued a strategy of reducing payments to providers as the prime method to reduce outlays. 
   Sometimes such a ``Washington-knows-best'' strategy just doesn't work. The fact of the matter is, health care providers will bear costs that cannot be overlooked or undervalued simply because HCFA wishes to declare it so. This has been especially prevalent in the area of Skilled Nursing Facility care. The recently implemented Prospective Payment System (PPS) fails to account for the full range of services required by most Medicare beneficiaries provided care in these facilities. 
   Specifically, the PPS implemented by HCFA has a payment schedule called Resource Utilization Groups (RUGs) that are intended to account for the needs of individual beneficiaries. However, these RUGs have failed to account for the full range of needs of these beneficiaries, especially for the medically complex patient. While private market insurance is significantly better at recognizing the needs of the medically complex patient, the failure of this administration to allow for any type of market-based reform to move forward has forced us to rely upon the implementation of the PPS by HCFA, which, as I discussed before, seems to have a predisposition towards underpaying for necessary services. 
   The result, Mr. President, is that beneficiaries are increasingly denied access to lower-cost Skilled Nursing Facilities and are forced to continue care in higher-cost hospitals where they also may not be able to get the most appropriate level of rehabilitative care. S. 1500, introduced by Senator HATCH, attempts to address the over-reaching of HCFA directly and swiftly. First, it would provide for payment ``add-ons'' for the provision of additional treatment in the care of the medically complex patient. Second, it restores one percentage point of the reductions to the annual inflation adjustor mandated by BBA-97. Although the inflation adjustment reduction was directly written in the BBA-97 language, it's revision provides Congress the most direct and simplest way to counteract the excesses of HCFA. 
   Mr. President, I am heartened that HCFA has recognized the flaws in the current PPS system and is undertaking a review of this system. However, that review will not be completed until next year. Our Skilled Nursing Facilities need these restorations now in order to continue to provide our Medicare beneficiaries continued and uninterrupted care. That is why I fully support this legislation, am cosponsoring it, and call on my colleagues to do the same as soon as possible.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Willie and Veronica Artis of Flint, Michigan. On October 19, 1999, they will be honored by Mott Community College for their many contributions to the greater Flint community. 
   In 1979, Willie Artis co-founded Genesee Packaging, Inc., a maker of corrugated packaging with a focus on the automotive industry. Mr. Artis and Mr. Buel Jones began this company by utilizing the opportunities that were available to them through General Motors' minority business development programs. Using their extensive background in automotive contract packaging and corrugated manufacturing, Mr. Artis and Mr. Jones were able to penetrate the existing automotive market and build a relationship with a General Motors buyer. 
   Upon co-founder Buel Jones' retirement, Willie Artis took control of the day-to-day operations of the company and implemented a restructuring of the organization. Presently, Genesee Packaging employs a total of 230 people in three different plants and has just completed thirty-three consecutive months of profitability. 
   Willie Artis has over twenty-eight years of experience in sales, corrugated manufacturing and automotive contract packaging. He obtained his education at Wilson College in Chicago, Illinois, and continued his education through executive seminars for business owners at Dartmouth College. He is currently President and Chief Executive Officer of Genesee Packaging, Inc. in Flint, Michigan. 
   Willie Artis' wife, Veronica Artis, is also an instrumental force at Genesee Packaging, Inc. Veronica obtained her higher education at the University of Wisconsin, Dartmouth College, Wharton School of Business, and Harvard University. Before joining Genesee Packaging, Inc, Veronica held various positions at Wisconsin Bell and Ameritech. Veronica joined Genesee Packaging, Inc. in 1989 as the Vice President of Administration and she is a member of the Executive Staff. 
   The event at Mott Community College on October 19, 1999, is a salute to Mr. and Mrs. Artis' success, their commitment to the greater Flint community, and their contributions as fine corporate citizens. A scholarship will be established in their names that will be held at the Foundation for Mott Community College. 
   I join Mott Community College and the entire Flint community in this celebration of two distinguished citizens, Willie and Veronica Artis.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank my colleagues for their consideration. 
   I rise today in support of what I believe is a real, substantive solution to the vexing question of campaign finance reform. To my mind that question is this: how do we revive voter confidence in the electoral process without violating the fundamental guidelines laid down in our Constitution? The answer, I believe, lies in public exposure and voter knowledge. The more voters know about the sources of a particular candidate's campaign funding, the better able they will be to determine whether that funding has or will interfere with the candidate's ability to represent them. 
   The solution I support is in the nature of a substitute amendment. I have cosponsored this amendment along with Senators HAGEL, DEWINE, GORTON, and THOMAS. 
   It was my hope that my colleagues and I would be able to introduce this substitute on the floor and call for a vote. However, procedural barriers have been created which have undermined meaningful debate on this issue. In the end, these procedural barriers have prevented my colleagues and I from submitting our substitute for a vote. However, because I believe campaign finance reform is a critical issue which will be with us for some time to come, I feel compelled to say a few words about the contents of the substitute. 
   I believe that provisions in the substitute correct key, perceived problems in our campaign financing system. The first section of the substitute would increase disclosure. It would ensure that the public, and the candidates' constituents in particular, are made immediately and continuously aware the sources of candidates' financing. It also would ensure public notification of any candidate financing by an outside organization or interest seeking to influence the election. 
   How would the substitute accomplish these ends? By requiring additional monthly and quarterly disclosure reports for federal candidates and for national political parties. The substitute would also require national party committees to disclose their receipts and disbursements from non-federal accounts--as they are currently required to do so for their federal accounts. A variety of other disclosure components is also included in the legislation. 
   The second section of the substitute imposes reasonable restrictions on soft money. I am very concerned about the constitutional implications of a complete ban on soft money. Thus, our substitute would place a $60,000 cap on soft money, pending an expedited review by the Supreme Court. I believe this approach deals responsibly with the issue of soft money, without ignoring potentially serious conflicts with the first amendment. 
   Also included within the substitute is a provision that would raise individual and PAC contribution limits to adjust for inflation. The present limits have been in place since 1974, when the first law regarding campaign finance was passed by the Congress. It is clearly justifiable that these limits be raised to reflect the present economic realities while maintaining the disclosure provisions so that the public can continue to be informed about the sources of financing. 
   In addition, I would have liked to have been given the opportunity to submit an additional amendment to campaign finance legislation. I would have introduce an amendment limiting non-constituent contributions to 50 percent of the total raised by the candidate. This amendment would accomplish a multitude of goals. It would instill a guideline for the candidates, instill confidence in the voters, and would help dispel the all too common notion that candidates are improperly influenced by campaign contributions. In my view it is not difficult for a politician to arrange financing in a way that avoids the appearance as well as the reality of corruption. 
   In the context of my amendment, all federal candidates would have to follow the same rules, dictating that they receive no more than 50 percent of overall contributions from PACs and out of state donors. Political committees that do not have their national headquarters within the candidate's state would be considered ``out of state'' contributions for these purposes. Any individual who is not a legal resident of the candidate's state and contributes $200 or more to a candidate would also be considered an ``out of state'' donor. 
   Why do I suggest such an approach? Because I don't think we are addressing the serious perception problems that exist with respect to campaign reform when we stand on the floor and focus all of the amendments on who gives money to the national parties. 
   The fact is the party is not the individual who is on the floor of the Senate casting votes. It is the 100 Members of the Senate. I believe what is relevant is who supports us. Can we claim to represent constituents if more than 50 percent of the money we receive from our campaigns come from people we don't represent? I argue the answer to that is no. 
   I think much more than contributions to the national parties undermines our constituents' confidence that when we are on the floor we are acting in the best interests of our constituents and our States. In my judgment, this type of amendment--one that, unfortunately, will not be voted on--is an important and integral part of any legitimate campaign reform proposal. I am certain Federal candidates would find that they can run successful campaigns with this 50-percent imposed limit. More importantly, these limits would increase politicians' accountability to their own constituents and decrease the appearance of out-of-State special interest influence.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. I believe the substitute, which I cosponsored with Senators HAGEL and THOMAS and GORTON and DEWINE, along with my proposed amendment, is the better way to reform campaign financing. I think it strikes a reasonable balance between addressing the issues of corruption with the constitutional concerns. I only wish these amendments had been allowed to reach the floor. I can assure my colleagues that I will continue to support real constructive campaign finance reform. 
   As I say, it is unfortunate that the structure of our procedures won't allow us to offer these variations. I think it is obvious to all Americans that right now we have an impasse. 
   The reason we have an impasse is because we have essentially only one alternative that is being treated as the only option available with respect to campaign finance reform. Clearly, the way to break a legislative logjam is to consider other alternatives. That is what the Senator from Nebraska and I are trying to do. Perhaps it won't happen in the context of this year's debate, but I hope in future debates we will go beyond the simple all-or-nothing approach that we have had in recent debates and give the rest of us a chance to have our amendments considered and voted on. I think that is the only way we are going to get to a conclusion that does, in fact, change the process, and for the better.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Yes. The most recently deployed Eagle Vision II mobile ground station has been fielded by the National Reconnaissance Office for use by the U.S. Army. It is a much improved system with even greater capability than the original Eagle Vision System built in 1995. Its enhanced mobility ensures rapid deployment and survivability, which is critical in meeting the current threats facing our military around the world. I am proud that a company from my state (ERIM International) has been the leader in developing and building this Eagle Vision mobile ground station capability. 
   The funding in this bill has been sought and provided to ensure that additional Eagle Vision systems will be built with state-of-the art mobile capabilities to meet the critical imagery needs of our warfighters in the future. This is an outstanding example of how American firms can effectively work in partnership with the U.S. military to provide state-of-the-art technology to protect our men and women in uniform.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I oppose the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, (CTBT). I do so because this accord is, in my view, fatally flawed. While I share the almost universal goal of nuclear nonproliferation, it seems clear to me that this Treaty, as written, will weaken America's national security. I have been strongly influenced in my examination of this issue by the fact that this treaty is opposed by 6 past Secretaries of Defense, 2 past Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 5 past Directors of the Central Intelligence Agency, Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft, former Ambassador to the United Nations Jeanne Kirkpatrick and a host of other experts in the field. 
   I took seriously the objection raised by these experts and public servants. And I have come to the conclusion that the CTBT would be dangerous to America, and to the American people. CTBT is not verifiable. It would erode our confidence in the safety and reliability of our own nuclear deterrent. And, perhaps most damning, it would utterly fail to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
   Let me explain my reasoning. 
   First, this treaty is not verifiable. The United States simply does not have the technical means to detect violations of the Treaty at this time. Nor are such technical means currently in development. Thus, it would be entirely feasible for an adversary to conduct significant military testing with little or no risk of detection. 
   With our current capability, we could not detect, with any significant degree of confidence, any nuclear testing producing yields of less than 1 kiloton. Yet testing that is of real, military significance does not require a 1 kiloton yield. If we are to have effective verification, we must have high and rationally based confidence that we can detect militarily significant cheating. 
   To make matter worse, potential adversaries can employ evasion techniques of varying complexity that would make nuclear tests with yields as large as 10 kilotons extremely difficult to detect and identify with any confidence. In addition, we should not forget that a country determined to develop a nuclear arsenal could do so without any testing whatsoever. The resulting nuclear capability might be unreliable. But it would be no less dangerous for that fact. 
   Throughout the last several decades of test ban negotiations it has consistently been United States policy that our nation would not sign any treaty unless it were effectively verifiable. This position has been based on solid reasoning: any adversary that covertly tests--while the United States foregoes testing--could gain significant military advantage over us. Based on this fault alone, I would recommend against ratification of CTBT. 
   But there are other serious flaws in this treaty that, in my view, dictate its rejection. Among these is the simple fact that reliability requires testing. Our nation's national security strategy is based on the policy of deterrence. CTBT will jeopardize our policy of nuclear deterrence by undermining the reliability of our nuclear weapons and by foreclosing the addition of advanced safety measures to our warheads. 
   Mr. President, for deterrence to be effective, the nuclear stockpile must be safe and reliable. By banning testing, the CTBT would permanently deny the US the only proven means we have for ensuring the safety and reliability of our nuclear deterrent. 
   The Administration is pursuing various new experimental techniques as part of its Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP) to replace actual nuclear testing with sophisticated computer modeling and simulations. However, these new techniques are not yet proven and there is no way to confirm that even the best models will be able to predict, with adequate precision, the condition of weapons systems. 
   In fact, Dr. James Schlesinger, the former Secretary of both Defense and Energy, has testified before the Senate that ``it will be many, many years before we can assess adequately the degree of success of the Stewardship Program and the degree to which it may mitigate the decline of confidence in the reliability of the stockpile.'' It would be irresponsible for us to bet something as critical to national security as the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons on unproven technology. We have no right to take such a leap of faith where the safety and very survival of the American people are involved. We must keep open the option of future testing. 
   Finally, the CTBT will neither stop nor slow nuclear proliferation. As I have mentioned, nuclear testing is not a prerequisite to acquiring a workable arsenal. Simple nuclear weapons can be designed with high confidence without nuclear testing. For example, South Africa designed and developed nuclear weapons without testing. The CTBT will not create a significant or meaningful obstacle to nuclear proliferation. A nation that attempts to build complex nuclear weapons will encounter problems with reliability. But it is entirely feasible for a nation to design, build, and stockpile effective nuclear weapons without nuclear testing. 
   CTBT, as its name implies, is simply a ban on nuclear explosions of any yield exceeding zero. It is not a treaty by which states which currently have nuclear weapons agree to give them up, reduce their numbers, even stop their development or agree not to give them to others. It simply would not provide any added safety in our dangerous world. Indeed, by reducing the reliability of our own nuclear deterrent and encouraging the secret development of nuclear weapons, it would significantly reduce the level of safety currently enjoyed by citizens of the United States, and of the world. 
   I am convinced that it would be a tragic disservice to the American people for this body to approve the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I urge my colleagues to vote for safety by voting against this treaty.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Holocaust Memorial Center in West Bloomfield, Michigan, as they celebrate their 15th Anniversary, and to pay tribute to those whose lives have been affected by the Holocaust. 
   The work of the Holocaust Memorial Center and especially Executive Vice President Rabbi Charles Rosenveig is truly commendable. In working to keep alive the spirit of those who suffered, the Holocaust Memorial Center helps us remember. In highlighting the rich history and culture of the Jewish people, the Holocaust Memorial Center helps us learn. 
   The events of the Holocaust cast a dark shadow over history. And while it is painful to remember, the Holocaust Memorial Center will not let us forget. Indeed, their mission is expressed in their logo, which is composed of four Hebrew characters that spell the word Zachor, which means ``remember.'' 
   On behalf of the United States Senate, I extend my warmest regards and best wishes to everyone in attendance at the 15th Anniversary Dinner and to all who have helped make the Holocaust Memorial Center an important educational resource for the State of Michigan and the country. I wish them continued success in their important mission.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. I rise to introduce a bill, the ``S Visa and Refugee Assistance Authorization Act,'' to extend the authorization for two provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The bill is cosponsored by Senator KENNEDY and is supported by the administration and the House immigration subcommittee. The legislation simply would extend for an additional two years the authorization of ``S'' temporary visas, which are used to allow individuals to stay in the United States to assist in criminal investigations. A sense of the Congress on the need to use these visas in more alien smuggling cases is also included. The bill also would extend for three years the authorization of refugee assistance. Such assistance is provided to localities and community-based organizations to help refugees upon their arrival in the United States. My hope is that these noncontroversial provisions can be passed expeditiously. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the RECORD.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator COVERDELL in offering this amendment to the Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill. Our amendment would prohibit the expenditure of taxpayer dollars on programs that provide free hypodermic needles to drug addicts. 
   In the past, President Clinton, through his Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala, has tried to lift the ongoing ban on federal funds for needle exchange programs. His reasoning? Such programs could reduce the rate of HIV infection among intravenous (IV) drug users without increasing the use of drugs like heroin. 
   Unfortunately, the evidence we have to date suggests that each of these suspicions is wrong. We now know beyond a reasonable doubt that needle exchange programs actually increase both the rate of HIV infection and the use of IV drugs. 
   What is more, they send the wrong message to our children. And they hurt our communities. 
   This administration has claimed a great deal of credit for the recent drop in some categories of drug use. 
   I don't want to downplay the progress that has been made over the last year. 
   But we must keep in mind that the improvements were small, and that this administration has a lot of work to do before it can bring us back to the levels of drug use achieved in 1992, the year before President Clinton took office. 
   The percentage of 8th, 10th, and 12th graders who had used an illicit drug during the previous 30 days dropped between 1997 and 1998, by 0.8 for 8th graders, 1.5 for 10th graders and 0.6 for 12th graders percentage points. 
   But levels of drug use remain substantially higher than in 1992--in some instances almost twice as high. 
   In 1992, 6.8 percent of 8th graders, 11 percent of 10th graders, and 14.4 percent of 12th graders reported having used an illicit drug within the past 30 days. 
   By 1998, even with recent dips, those figures ranged from 12.1 percent for 8th graders to 21.5 percent for 10th graders to 25.6 percent--more than one in four 12th graders. 
   Now is not the time, Mr. President, to let our guard down in the war on drugs. As we continue to fight our difficult battle with drug abuse, the last thing we need is for Washington to send the message that drug use is okay. 
   Let me very quickly review some of the overwhelming evidence that has made it crystal clear that needle exchange programs are inherently ill-considered and doomed to failure. 
   First, we now know that needle exchange programs encourage drug use: Deaths from drug overdoses have increased over five times since 1988. 
   In addition, we now have clinical studies, including one conducted in Vancouver and published in the Journal of AIDS. That study showed that deaths from drug overdoses have increased over five times in that city since needle exchanges began in 1988. Vancouver now has the highest death rate from heroin in North America. 
   Such terrible statistics should not surprise us given the lack of basic, commonsense logic in needle exchange programs. 
   Mr. President, giving an addict a clean needle is equivalent to giving an alcoholic a clean glass. 
   And once we lose sight of this logic, we have already lost the war on drugs. We have, in effect, handed our streets over to people who do not believe that we should win that war. 
   Let me cite just one example of the recklessness with which so many of these programs are run. The New York Times magazine in 1997 reported that one New York City needle exchange program gave out 60 syringes to a single person, little pans to ``cook'' the heroin, instructions on how to inject the drug, and a card exempting the user from arrest for possession of drug paraphernalia. 
   But needle exchange programs do not have to be run recklessly in order to encourage drug use. 
   Dr. Janet Lapey with Drug Watch International recently quoted pro-needle activist Donald Grove, who pointed out that ``most needle exchange programs ..... Serve as sites of informal organizing and coming together. A user might be able to do the networking needed to find drugs in the half an hour he spends at the street-based needle exchange site--networking that might otherwise have taken half a day.'' 
   It's just common sense, Mr. President. If you give an addict more needles, he will use them, drug use will increase, and so will the dying. 
   And that includes deaths from HIV/AIDS. We now know that needle exchange programs actually increase the spread of this dread disease. 
   For example, a Montreal study was published in the American Journal of Epidemiology. It found that intravenous drug users in a needle exchange program were more than twice as likely to become infected with HIV as addicts not using such a program.  
   And the figures from the Vancouver study are astounding. When the Vancouver needle exchange program started in 1988, 1 to 2 percent of drug addicts in that city had HIV. Now 23 percent of drug addicts in Vancouver have HIV. 
   To put it succinctly, Mr. President, we now know that needle exchange programs are bad for drug users. They promote this deadly habit and they promote the spread of HIV. 
   But we know more, Mr. President. We also know that needle exchange programs send the wrong message to our kids: 
   Let me quote President Clinton's own drug czar, General Barry McCaffrey, who said ``the problem is not dirty needles, the problem is heroin addiction. ..... The focus should be on bringing help to this suffering population--not giving them more effective means to continue their addiction. One doesn't want to facilitate this dreadful scourge on mankind.'' 
   Mr. President, needle exchange programs undermine our drug fighting efforts, and they undermine the very rule of law we all depend on for our safety and freedom. 
   I urge my colleagues to support our amendment to prohibit taxpayer dollars from being spent on needle exchange programs. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the fighting men of the Fox Division, United States Navy, USS Rochester (CA-124), who bravely served our country in the Korean Conflict from June, 1950 to March, 1953. Aboard the USS Rochester--the flagship of the Commander Seventh Fleet--the men of the Fox Division participated in nearly every major naval engagement along the Korean Peninsula. The Fox Division's three teams: the Main Plot, the Sky Plot, and the Mark 56 directors, shared the critical responsibility of operating, repairing, and maintaining the complex equipment which ensured the accuracy of the Rochester's weapons systems. They accomplished these tasks with outstanding success. 
   The Fox Division recently celebrated their 1999 reunion in Frankenmuth, Michigan. Some of these reunited shipmates had not seen each other in over 45 years. Included among their ranks were: 
   Jerry Barca; John Brothers; Robert Cadden; Russell Daniels; Farrell Ferguson; Sheri Holman, representing her late husband Bob Holman; Bill Hontz; Marv Hufford; Larry Kobie; Tony Kontowicz; Leo Lane; Charles Newsham; Bobby Page; Carl Ray; Ronald Richards; Pete Russell; Roland Schneider; Donald Spencer; and Joe West. 
   Today I join my colleagues in thanking the men of the Fox Division for defending the cause of democracy, and for preserving our country's national security. I am proud to say that these veterans are an inspiration to all of us. By dedicating a portion of their lives to the service of their country, they have helped guarantee the freedom we Americans hold so dear. Our nation is grateful to each and every member of the Fox Division, USS Rochester, for their outstanding dedication and commitment to the United States of America.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in memory of Jim Upton DeFrancis: a great politician, a great historian, and a great family man, who died on January 1 of this year. 
   Jim DeFrancis was one of the most influential people in the political field, always maintaining political savvy--but not sacrificing perspective, an incredible sense of humor, and a belief that politics was an avenue for serving others. Very early in my career, I had the good fortune of working for Jim in Senator Bob Griffin's office. I will never forget the many lessons I learned from him--both directly and simply by working near him. One couldn't help but learn from Jim DeFrancis. 
   In addition to his 10 years with Senator Griffin, Jim DeFrancis was an integral member of the presidential campaigns of Gerald Ford and George Romney. As a member of the staff of these politicians, Jim was able to avoid the spotlight while serving Michigan and national politics, in the honorable and professional manner for which now he is recognized as a very significant member of Michigan political history. 
   Jim's love of politics was rooted in his love of history. He especially enjoyed reading about Winston Churchill. An avid reader, Jim collected any book on Winston Churchill that he could find, as well as other artifacts related to the late Prime Minister. During difficult times, Jim would look at Churchill's life as a model, gaining inspiration and guidance. 
   And while Jim's contribution to politics is exceptional--in his very actions, he inspired us to work for others through politics--his true love was his family. More than anything else, Jim DeFrancis was a family man. Survived by his wife, three sons, his mother and sister, his family was the real focus of his life. Everyone who came in contact with him would quickly learn about his family--as he always found a way to bring them up in a conversation. 
   Jim DeFrancis' devotion to his family, his friends, and his career was matched by few and will be deeply missed by those who knew him. We will never forget Jim--crossing paths with Jim DeFrancis was sure to leave a lasting impact. And it is this lasting, far-reaching impact that Jim's life has had on those who knew him which calls to mind a quote that I think Jim would appreciate, not only because it is a quote by Winston Churchill, but because I believe Jim would be moved to know what an influence he had on us: 
   ``This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.''

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and congratulate Frederik Meijer and the Frederik Meijer Gardens as they unveil and dedicate the Da Vinci sculpture Il Cavallo (the horse). 
   Frederik Meijer's incredible generosity and foresight enabled Il Cavallo to be seen at its permanent home in the Frederik Meijer Gardens. In an effort to fulfill his dream of creating a world class sculpture garden Frederik Meijer and the City of Milan, Italy (where an identical sculpture is located) allowed for the work of Da Vinci to be recommissioned and created. Il Cavallo was originally sketched and commissioned by Da Vinci in 1482 and he continued to work on it for fourteen years. However, the bronze intended to cast the sculpture was used to make cannons to defend the city of Milan, therefore Da Vinci never completed the work. 
   In 1977, after reading an article about the horse that Da Vinci never had the chance to create, amateur sculpture and pilot, Charles Dent created the first model of Il Cavallo. After his death in 1994 Nina Akamu sculpted the Il Cavallo that is on display today. The sculpture was cast using twenty thousand pounds of bronze, stands twenty-four feet tall and weighs fifteen tons. 
   Frederik Meijer is to be thanked and commended for carrying out his vision and giving a world class gift to the city of Grand Rapids and the people of Michigan. Nearly five hundred years ago Da Vinci had the vision for this great horse. Due to the acts of Frederik Meijer, a great humanitarian, this rare and magnificent work of art will stand tall in the Frederik Meijer Gardens for all to see for many years to come.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, if I may comment, I certainly appreciate Senators will differ on issues, and I have talked with the Senator from Minnesota. I understand his feelings on the issue he would like to include, either in the context of legislation I am talking about tonight or in some other context. But I point out for the benefit of all of our colleagues that the legislation that was the subject of this unanimous consent proposal, S. 761, is a very important piece of legislation but not one I believe should become tied up in a variety of nongermane amendments and debate. 
   The bill that would have been proposed, S. 761, is essentially a bill which would seek to make it feasible for us to engage in electronic commercial activities and to provide validity to what we call digital signatures or the authentication of digital signatures to allow for the expansion and continuing development of commercial activities over the Internet. 
   This legislation is needed, and it is my understanding, in efforts to secure unanimous consent to go to this, we have found as many as 99 Members in support of this bill. That is not surprising. The States are in desperate hope we will pass this legislation and pass it soon. 
   It left the Senate Commerce Committee, as the Presiding Officer knows, being a member of the committee, with unanimous support on a bipartisan basis. I have been pleased to offer this legislation, along with my colleague, Senator WYDEN of Oregon, and a number of cosponsors. 
   It was basically to this point uncontroversial. We have worked closely with Senator LEAHY to come forward with a substitute which we are prepared ultimately to offer that I think addresses some concerns that had been expressed. 
   The administration has expressed its support for the legislation as well. So I hope that we can, if not in the context of today, then at a point very soon, find some manner or means to pass the legislation and move it forward. 
   Every day, the expansion of those who have access to the Internet is increasing. Every day, the activities of a commercial sort that go on through the Internet are increasing. What the people who are engaging in those commercial activities need is a certainty that their contracts over the Internet will be, in fact, authenticated and given full faith and credit. The absence of this legislation makes that issue somewhat in doubt. 
   So while 42 States, I believe, have now passed their own digital signature laws, no 2 of these are alike. States are working hard at this time to come up with a uniform system and, in fact, a uniform code for digital signatures, and authentication has been developed but it has not yet been passed. 
   In the interim, until that happens, in my judgment, we need to have a system in place. This legislation would provide it. It is strongly backed by the high-tech industries of our country. I know they will be contacting Members in the hope that we can move this forward because there are so many, as I have said already, increases in the use of the Internet for commercial activity going on every single day. 
   So I deeply regret we could not move to this legislation tonight. I hope that as Senators with other agenda items consider ways to bring their items to the floor, they will find germane, as opposed to nongermane, vehicles to which to offer their amendments, or at least, at a minimum, they will not seek to stall this legislation any further. 
   I think it is an important bill. I do not think it is controversial. But I think every day we go without its passage, we will create the potential for greater problems in regard to the expansion of commercial activity that takes place in this country through the Internet and through electronic means. 
   So, Mr. President, I yield the floor. Hopefully, at a date very soon, I will be back so we can successfully move forward on this legislation.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise with my good friend and colleague, Senator MACK, to introduce the Measures to Encourage Results in Teaching Act, or as it is frequently and aptly called, the MERIT Act. 
   Mr. President, there has been a great deal of discussion regarding our nation's schools and the state of elementary and secondary public school education. This country spends $740 billion per year on education. This is more than the Gross Domestic Products of Spain, Canada or Brazil. Yet the results of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study for Eighth Grade Students ranked American students 28th in science and 17th in math when compared to students in other countries. This situation worsens by the twelfth grade, when our advanced students performed at the bottom of international comparisons. 
   Mr. President, 43 percent of our fourth graders cannot pass a basic reading test. Our children deserve the highest quality education possible and unfortunately, as just even these few statistics demonstrate, we are failing. Neither our children nor our nation can succeed unless we improve our educational system. 
   Without a good education and the strong skills it provides, our young people will not be able to get good jobs at good wages. Without skilled, educated workers, our businesses will lose their competitive edge in the world marketplace. The prosperity of our entire nation demands that we do more to improve our children's education. 
   The question then, Mr. President, is ``how can we improve our kids' education?'' There are a lot of fancy theories floating about on this topic. But one thing we know for certain: the most important educational tool in any classroom remains a qualified, highly trained teacher. Teachers play a special and indispensable role in our  children's education. Nothing can replace the positive and long lasting impact a dedicated, knowledgeable teacher has on a child's learning process. And nothing can compensate for the weak teaching that, despite the best of intentions, can result from a teacher's lack of knowledge, preparation, skill and interest. 
   The bulk of our teachers are working hard, under difficult circumstances, to educate our children. Unfortunately, Mr. President, too many of them have not gained the training they need to succeed in educating young people. Currently, the Department of Education reports that one-third of high school math teachers, nearly 25 percent of high school English teachers and 20 percent of science teachers are teaching without a college major or even a college minor in their subjects. 
   The MERIT Act constitutes an important step toward providing better education. It will ensure that teachers have the training they need to succeed, and that teachers are rewarded for their successes. Common sense dictates that teachers should have subject-matter knowledge in the areas they teach. Common sense also dictates that teachers who motivate and inspire their students, and who put forth the extra effort to improve and expand upon their own skills and knowledge, should be rewarded. 
   The MERIT Act puts common sense into action. It will provide incentives for states to establish teacher testing and merit pay policies. Specifically, this legislation would provide that 50 percent of the funds provided over the Fiscal Year 2000 appropriation level for the Eisenhower Professional Development Program will be made available to any state that has established periodic assessments of elementary and secondary school teachers, and implements a pay system to reward teachers based on merit and proven performance. 
   Mr. President, I'd like to be particularly clear on one point: This bill will not result in any reductions in funding for the Eisenhower Professional Development Program. This is an incentive program, not another Washington-knows-best mandate. No state will be penalized for its decision not to participate in the MERIT Act program. In fact, should the appropriation level for the Eisenhower Program increase, so will the amount provided to each state. 
   What this legislation will provide, Mr. President, is an important incentive for states to make certain that our kids are taught by committed teachers who have received the training they need to succeed. Day in and day out, teachers make a real difference for our kids. They inspire children to dream, and to work to make those dreams come true. They help our young people realize their full potential and work to achieve it. Their contributions are invaluable and their efforts demand commendation. The MERIT Act would reward these teachers for their commitment and ensure that our children will be taught by the most qualified and knowledgeable individuals available. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Alien Smuggling Prevention and Enforcement Act. This legislation, which I am introducing with my colleagues, Senator SCHUMER and Senator FEINSTEIN, will give law enforcement new tools and resources in the continuing fight against the smuggling of illegal aliens. 
   Despite continued efforts, Mr. President, alien smuggling remains a serious problem in America. Smugglers have responded to increases in the efforts of our border patrol by adopting more daring methods to smuggle individuals illegally into the United States. In many cases, these methods entail little or no concern for the safety of the individuals being smuggled. Moreover, these attempts increasingly involve organized criminal gangs. As recently as 1996, in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, Congress has acted to combat this dangerous form of smuggling. But it is clear that more needs to be done. 
   I would like to quote from a story appearing in the August 15, 1999 edition of the Detroit News. This story sums up well our current situation, demonstrating that we face a problem of national importance: ``Illegal alien smuggling is a growing yet largely hidden business along the U.S.-Canadian border. Smugglers are getting as much as $50,000 per person to bring in aliens desperate to reach the United States. Yet immigration authorities, short of personnel and detention facilities, can do little to slow the activity.'' The story goes on to quote Carl L. McClafferty, chief of the Detroit sector of the Border Patrol, who notes ``We get spurts of drug smuggling, but we have a constant drone of alien smuggling. For us, alien smuggling is steady work.'' 
   My state of Michigan has been hit particularly hard by alien smugglers. Crackdowns in other areas of the country have made Detroit in particular a target for illegal entry. We simply do not have the staff on hand with the tools and resources needed to successfully combat this problem. This means more illegal aliens in our country. It also produces an added boost to criminal gang activities and all the problems these activities bring with them. And that, Mr. President, is why I am introducing this legislation. 
   The Alien Smuggling Prevention and Enforcement Act would do the following. 
   First, it would double the personnel devoted to combating alien smuggling. Today, Mr. President, approximately 260 people are employed by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to investigate and fight alien smuggling. This figure has not risen in the past three years. This legislation would require the INS to add 50 more investigators and other enforcement personnel each year over the next 5 years, each of them devoted to combating alien smuggling. 
   Second, this legislation would double criminal sentences for alien smugglers. Under U.S. Sentencing Commission guidelines, the current minimum sentence for smuggling one to five aliens is 10 months; for smuggling 6-24 aliens the minimum sentence is 18 months; for 25-100 aliens it's 27 months; and for more than 100 aliens it's 37 months. Simply put, those sentences are not high enough to deter this heinous conduct. Nor are they severe enough, in moral terms, as punishment for acts involving intentional breaking of American law and the serious risk of injury and death to innocent parties and those being smuggled. This legislation would direct the U.S. Sentencing Commission to double the relevant sentences to 20 months, 36 months 54 months, and 74 months, respectively. 
   Third, this legislation would increase fines for those convicted of alien smuggling to twice the amount an alien smuggler received, or expected to receive, for his or her this illegal activity. Under U.S. Sentencing Commission guidelines, currently the minimum fine is $3,000 for smuggling one to five aliens; for smuggling 6-24 aliens the fine is $4,000; for 25-100 aliens it's $6,000; and for more than 100 aliens it's $7,500. Again, that is simply not strict enough, particularly given the profits to be made from this illegal activity. This legislation would direct the U.S. Sentencing Commission to impose a fine above these minimum levels equal to twice the amount an alien smuggler received, or expected to receive, for his or her illegal activity. 
   This legislation also would authorize additional operating expense money to conduct undercover operations and prosecute alien smuggling and require an annual report to Congress by the Commissioner of the INS on the agency's strategy to deal wit alien smuggling. 
   Taken together, Mr. President, these measures will deter alien smuggling. By giving law enforcement personnel the tools they need to catch alien smugglers and seeing to it that they are punished as harshly as is called for by their crime, this legislation will help deter illegal immigration and deal a very real blow to criminal gang activity.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Francis M. Wilson and his wonderful and admirable life. 
   Mr. Wilson served as a tech-sergeant during World War II in Germany when he was only 18 years old. He was an engineer in the Detroit Public School District, a devoted family man, and an active citizen. The challenges he successfully faced in these capacities have distinguished him within his family, his town, his state, and his country. 
   As a very young boy, he sold ``Liberty'' magazines to supplement his family's income during the Great Depression. Growing up during a time of financial strife led him to find solace in nature. Mr. Wilson was exposed to nature during his experience in the military and developed a love and knowledge of it. As a young adult he was able to identify a variety of birds, insects, trees, and flowers. He then went on to form and preside over a group of citizens that forced new construction to adhere to guidelines designed to protect nearby lakes. 
   Once he reached adulthood, Mr. Wilson found his real love, Dolores. Together they found great joy in their children and grandchildren. Mr. Wilson wanted to ensure that they received all the advantages that he did not have. He inspired his children to put themselves through college. He provided them with the opportunity to grow up in a safe environment, allowing them to mature at a more deliberate pace than the one that was forced upon him. His wife, Dolores, expresses the best tribute to Mr. Wilson when she writes ``this brave, honest, dedicated, ordinary man was to his family and America `the staff of life' that fuels generations to come.'' 
   Mr. Wilson expressed his passion for education through his involvement with children as an engineer of thirty years in the Detroit Public Schools. He gave and received respect from all he knew. He not only led by lecture but, more importantly and effectively, by example. He never left any doubt as to where he stood in a debate and firmly believed in right and wrong. Mr. Wilson offered little patience for individuals passing on responsibility as an excuse for negligent or bad behavior. Personifying Winston Churchill's statement, ``We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give,'' Mr. Francis M. Wilson left this world an honorable, loyal, selfless servant to his country and a loved and missed father, grandfather and husband.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and congratulate the Ingham County Women's Commission, as they celebrate their 25th Anniversary. 
   The Ingham County Women's Commission has taken great strides to meet the needs of women since it was founded in 1974. The commission, originally established to serve as a study and research center focusing on the issues concerning women in the county, was restructured in 1976 and took on an advisory role to the Board of Commissioners. They now focus on issues that impact the women of the county. They have continued their efforts in researching better ways to meet the needs of women through county resources. 
   What is truly remarkable about this select group is their dedication to helping enrich the lives of women. They work closely with the Equal Opportunity Commission to overcome discrimination against women. The commission also provides many important and beneficial services to women. Their greatest accomplishments include involvement with the New Way In and Rural Emergency Outreach and the provision of acquaintance rape education for high school students. Additionally, they have experienced vast success in helping raise awareness of women's issues by developing a sexual harassment policy for county employees, sponsoring the Ingham County Sexual Assault Task Force and the Michigan Council of Domestic Violence. 
   This important group of women are to be commended for their accomplishments over the last 25 years. Their hard work and dedication to conveying the importance of women's issues will benefit many women for years to come.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Michigan to engage the Chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee in a colloquy regarding the Coast Guard's proposal to close the seasonal air facility in Muskegon, MI. On July 13th, we wrote the distinguished Chairman to seek his assistance on this issue and attempted to explain the necessity to keep this facility open. 
   Mr. President, in that letter, we described how on February 3rd of this year, we wrote the Commandant of the Coast Guard and the Secretary of Transportation asking for a detailed explanation of this proposal in light of what appeared to be a dramatic reversal on the Administration's part given its previous statements as to both the desirability of Muskegon and the overall need for a southern Lake Michigan seasonal facility.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to engage the Chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee in a colloquy regarding the Intelligent Transportation System program. Mr. President, I was very pleased that the report accompanying S. 1143, the Senate Transportation Appropriations bill for FY 2000, contained direction that Southeast Michigan receive no less than $4 million for ITS deployment projects. I was particularly pleased with that designation as I had requested the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee provide $3.5 million for the Southeast Michigan Snow Information Management System, and wish to thank the distinguished Chairman of the Subcommittee for that designation. Does the Chairman believe such a further designation for this particular project would be in order?

   Mr. ABRAHAM. I appreciate the Senator's support and clarification Mr. President, and join him in calling upon the FHWA to quickly provide this additional funding for the SEMSIM project as soon as the Appropriations Act is signed into law. 
   Mr. President, I would also like to take this opportunity to discuss what should be done with the remaining $500,000 within that $4 million distribution to Southeast Michigan. Mr. President, I would like the Chairman of the  Subcommittee to know that after he had marked up S. 1143, I received a request from Wayne County in Michigan to support a Roads Infrastructure Management System project that will use Global Positioning Satellite system technology and data to geocode the existing infrastructure inventory over the county's 1,400 miles of roads, such as signage, lighting, bridges, and existing utility runs, so as to better identify where road improvements will be most efficiently executed, and provide the greatest improvements. The ultimate goal is to implement a travel routing system that can be accessed over the Internet by commuters and freight carriers. Having this geocoded inventory will permit the county to quantitatively assess and schedule road improvement projects and improve traffic flow. 
   The total cost of a comprehensive Geographic Information System is about $60 million, but Wayne County has already committed $14 million to building this base map, and to date, has completed all of it's digital ortho photography at the 6 pixel resolution. The Roads Information Management System is one of the most costly applications within this project, and will cost the County $7.4 million. The County was originally seeking $5 million in federal funding, but I believe any portion thereof would further this worthy effort. 
   Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished Chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee if he could support this project within the existing $4 million designation?

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the Manager of this Appropriations Bill regarding funding of specific projects under the Next Generation High Speed Rail Program. 
   Mr. President, I see that the FY 2000 Transportation Appropriations Bill provides a total of $7.3 million for various positive train control projects, and of that amount, $5 million is designated for the Alaska Railroad and $1 million for the Transportation Safety Research Alliance. 
   Now Mr. President, as the Chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee is well aware, the Administration requested $3 million for the Incremental Train Control System (ITCS) along the Detroit to Chicago passenger rail corridor in its FY 2000 Budget Request. This project has previously received $6 million in federal funds, and I am very thankful for the designation the Chairman was able to convince the Conference Committee to provide this project last year even though my request came very late in the legislative process. 
   The reason I believe this project is worthy of specific funding is that it is a key component in the efforts by Amtrak as well as the Midwest High Speed Rail Coalition to allow for passenger rail service of up to 125 miles per hour, not only along the Detroit to Chicago corridor, but elsewhere as the $3 million requested by the Administration would complete the research of this project, and allow the technology to be applied to other rail corridors across the country. 
   Mr. President, I recognize the strict funding constraints the Subcommittee faced in drafting this appropriations bill, and the significant hurdles that had to be overcome in order to find this level of funding, but I wonder if the Chairman may be able to comment on the possibility that some level of funding could be found for the ITCS project.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment offered by Senators GORTON, FEINSTEIN, and BRYAN. 
   I oppose this amendment because it will impose an unnecessary and unacceptable burden on the working men and women of this country, and of my state in particular. 
   Throughout Michigan, men and women are working hard every day to produce the cars that make our economy and our nation move. They and their families depend on the jobs produced by our automobile manufacturing industry, just as the rest of us depend on the cars they produce.  
   But those jobs and Michigan's economy are jeopardized by efforts to increase standards for corporate average fuel economy or CAFE. 
   I have come to the floor because I want to make certain that my colleagues are aware of the extremely serious impact of increased CAFE standards, not just on Michigan, but on every state in the union. And make no mistake, increased CAFE standards are the intention of the amendment we are debating today, and will be the result should it be adopted. 
   The Federal Government currently mandates that auto manufacturers maintain an average fuel economy of 27.5 miles per gallon for cars, and 20.7 miles per gallon for sport utility vehicles and light trucks. 
   Since 1995 Congress has prohibited federal transportation funds from being used to unilaterally increase these standards. We have recognized that it is our duty, as legislators, to make policy in this important area of economic and environmental concern. 
   Now, however, a number of my colleagues are calling for an end to this congressional authority. This sense-of-the-Senate urges the Senate conferees to the Transportation appropriation bill to reject the House funding prohibition on raising CAFE standards. 
   It does not call for the Department of Transportation to study the benefits and costs of raising CAFE standards, as some proponents of this amendment have suggested. Rather, the amendment states: ``The Senate should not recede to section 320 of this bill, as passed by the House of Representatives, which prevents an increase in CAFE standards.'' 
   Make no mistake and I reiterate this, if the House funding prohibition is stripped from this bill, the Department of Transportation will raise CAFE standards. Current law requires D.O.T. to set CAFE standards each year at the ``maximum feasible fuel economy level.'' And the Secretary is not authorized to just ``study'' CAFE. He must act by regulation to set new CAFE standards each year. 
   In 1994, the last year prior to the CAFE freeze, the administration began rulemaking on new CAFE standards. Department of Transportation's April 6, 1994 proposal referenced feasible higher CAFE levels for trucks of 15 to 35 percent above the current standard. 
   So let us be clear, this is not and never has been about a study. This proposed sense-of-the-Senate amendment is a precursor to higher CAFE standards on Sport Utility Vehicles and light trucks. 
   Mr. President, this action is misguided. It will hurt the working families of Michigan. It will undermine American competitiveness. And it will reduce passenger safety. 
   Higher CAFE requirements cost jobs. It really is that simple. Let me explain what I mean. 
   To meet increased CAFE requirements, automakers must make design and material changes to their cars. Those changes cost money, and force American manufacturers to build cars that are smaller, less powerful and less popular with consumers. 
   In addition, the National Academy of Sciences found that raising CAFE requirements to 35 mpg would increase the average vehicle's cost by about $2,500. And that is just a low-end estimate. 
   Japanese automakers have escaped these costs because sky-high gasoline prices in their home markets forced them to make smaller, lighter cars years ago. Increased CAFE requirements will continue to favor Japanese auto makers. And that means they will continue to place an uneven burden on American automobile workers. 
   Increased CAFE standards also reduce consumer choice, contrary to the assertions made in the earlier debate. 
   For example, the principal reason full sized station wagons have disappeared from the market is the need to meet fleet mileage requirements under the CAFE program. 
   Full-size station wagons, long popular with the American public, simply cannot be engineered economically to achieve high enough gas mileage to make them worth selling. 
   Consumers suffer when their choices are narrowed. and auto makers and their employees suffer when they are forced to make cars the public simply does not want. 
   In a statement before the Consumer Subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee, Dr. Marina Whitman of General Motors notes that in 1982:  
   We were forced to close two assembly plants which had been fully converted to produce our new, highly fuel-efficient compact and mid-size cars. The cost of these conversions was $130 million, but the plants were closed because demand for those cars did not develop during a period of sharply declining gasoline prices.  
   This story could be repeated for every major American automaker, Mr. President. And the effects on our overall economy have been devastating. 
   The American auto industry accounts for one in seven U.S. jobs. Steel, transportation, electronics, literally dozens of industries employing thousands upon thousands of American depend on the health of our auto industry. 
   Our automakers simply cannot afford to pay the fines imposed on them if they fail to reach CAFE standards, or to build cars that Americans will not buy. In either case the real victims are American workers and consumers. 
   Nor should we forget, that American automakers are investing almost $1 billion every year in research to develop more fuel efficient vehicles. 
   Indeed, we do not need to turn to the punitive, disruptive methods of CAFE standards to increase fuel economy for American vehicles. 
   Since 1993, the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles has brought together government agencies and the auto industries to conduct joint research--research that is making significant progress and will bridge the gap to real world applications after 2000. 
   By enhancing research cooperation, the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles will help our auto industry develop vehicles that are more easily recyclable, have lower emissions, and can achieve up to triple the fuel efficiency of today's midsize family sedans. All this while producing cars that retain performance, utility, safety, and economy. 
   We have made solid progress toward making vehicles that achieve greater fuel economy without sacrificing the qualities consumers demand. 
   Finally, I wish to address the issue of vehicle safety. For a number of years now, the federal government has taken the lead in mandating additional safety features on automobiles in an attempt to reduce the number of lives lost in auto accidents. 
   How ironic to learn that federal CAFE requirements have been costing lives all this time. 
   The Competitive Enterprise Institute recently estimated that between 2,600 and 4,500 drivers and passengers die every year as a result of CAFE-induced auto downsizing.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, even the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration, which runs the CAFE program, has recognized the deadly effects of CAFE standards. 
   In its publication ``Small Car Safety in the 1980's,'' NHTSA explains that smaller cars are less crash worthy than large ones, even in single-vehicle accidents. Small cars have twice the death rate of drivers and passengers in crashes as larger cars. 
   And smaller light trucks will mean even more fatalities. These trucks and SUV's have higher centers of gravity and so are more prone to rollovers. If SUV and truck weights are reduced, thousands could die. 
   I believe it is crucial that we get the facts straight on the true effects of CAFE standards so that we can come to the only rational conclusion available: safe, economically sensible increases in gas mileage require cooperation and research and technology, not Federal mandates. 
   Therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Gorton-Feinstein-Bryan amendment. 
   Mr. President, it is very simple. When Washington makes these dictates, when unelected bureaucrats make these decisions and impose them on an industry, the ramifications can and will be serious. We have seen that before in the auto industry. If this were to go forward, we would see it again. The autoworkers in my State and around this country, and the people who work in other industries that are related to the sale of automobiles, will have their lives in jeopardy, as well as their jobs in jeopardy, if we move in this direction.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will make some brief remarks in response to some of the comments that have been made by the Senator from Washington and others, as well as to elaborate on some of my earlier remarks today. 
   First, I point out that with respect to the safety issues, the question is not whether on a cumulative basis there have been fewer fatalities since the implementation of CAFE standards. The question is what the consequence is or the correlation is between fatalities and CAFE standards. 
   Since 1975, on a variety of fronts, safety efforts have gone forward to protect passengers and drivers in motor vehicles ranging from the introduction of airbags to State laws which require the use of seatbelts, primary laws that require the use of seatbelts to the introduction of countless child safety and passenger protection activities and child safety seats. One cannot draw that correlation. 
   What one can, of course, do is follow the studies of USA Today and the National Academy of Sciences that try to determine what the direct effects of CAFE have been, and those effects are quite clear. As the Senator from Missouri and my counterpart, my colleague from Michigan, have indicated, the conclusion is the direct consequence of CAFE standards has been an increase in fatalities since 1975 of an estimated 46,000 people who lost their lives as a consequence of CAFE standards because of the lighter vehicles and the less safe vehicles that CAFE has fostered. 
   Mr. President, I note the Senator from Ohio is here. He wishes to speak, and I yield up to 5 minutes to him.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Senator from Nevada for his confidence in my legal skills. As I read the sense-of-the-Senate resolution which has been proposed, it says, in its concluding section, the resolution section:  
   It is the sense of the Senate that the issue of CAFE standards should be permitted to be examined by the Department of Transportation.  
   And then in subsection (2):  
   The Senate should not recede to section 320 of this bill, as passed by the House of Representatives, which prevents an increase in CAFE standards.  
   Now, if we do not include that provision, if the sense-of-the-Senate resolution were to prevail and that were to be the ultimate outcome and section 320 as contained in the House version of the legislation were to not survive the conference and the final resolution of the legislation, it is my understanding that we would then revert back to the process which is in the law otherwise, which, by my understanding of it, mandates that the Department of Transportation, under 49 USC subtitle 5 part (c) section 32902, required that the Department of Transportation set CAFE standards each year at ``the maximum feasible average fuel economy level.'' 
   I believe that is what would happen at the Department of Transportation. The Secretary of Transportation is not authorized to just study CAFE. He must act by regulation to set new CAFE standards each year. That has not happened because of the moratorium which has been imposed over recent years, since 1995. Prior to the CAFE freeze in 1994, the administration began rulemaking on new CAFE standards. On April 6 of 1994, again, in the last year--I don't want to take all the Senator's time; I will try to be quick--the proposal referenced feasible higher CAFE levels for trucks of 15 to 35 percent above the current standard.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Obviously, the law sets forth criteria that are to be employed. I don't have those in front of me. I will accept the contention of the Senator from Nevada that those are the criteria. The question is whether a prejudgment as to the outcome is already ordained. In my judgment, the positions that were already in process in 1994, prior to the implementation of the moratorium, suggest that those decisions 5 years ago had already essentially resulted in a preliminary decision to increase the standards by 15 to 35 percent. If, in effect, the moratorium does not go forward, I believe we would, indeed, be moving a process that will mandate this kind of increase.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. There are other opponents on my side who wish to speak. Let me summarize with a few concluding remarks. 
   I want to first reiterate what my colleague from Michigan, Senator LEVIN, has said. A chart that shows the correlation between increases in CAFE and decreases in fatalities is not based on a study that relates the two. 
   The studies that do relate the two, particularly as he said, the outside study by the National Academy of Sciences, suggest a contrary finding. In fact, the implementation of CAFE standards has led to approximately 46,000 lost lives as a consequence of the lighter vehicles being in our fleets. 
   The second point I make relates to the broader point that also was made earlier by my colleague from Michigan. Higher CAFE standards are going to affect American manufactured products, but not necessarily the products of our competitors from overseas. Hence, the same kind of vehicles, with virtually the same types of fuel efficiency levels, as well as the same types of emission levels, will be purchased by the same market that wants and craves these vehicles today. The only difference will be the kind of difference we saw back in the late 1970s and early 1980s and throughout much of the decade of the 1980s when we found the foreign imports' share of the American market continuing to go up, at the expense of American domestically manufactured products, and ultimately at the expense of American autoworker jobs. 
   In summation, this is simple to me: Do we want to put at risk the safety of people who will be purchasing sports utility vehicles, light trucks, and others by making a change in CAFE standards? I hope the answer is no. Do we want to risk the jobs of American autoworkers? I speak not just for those autoworkers in Michigan, who tend to be on the front lines, but many other people in this country who are working in related industries and whose jobs are affected by the sale of domestically manufactured automobiles. Do we want to put at risk all of these jobs? I don't think so. Do we want to risk the investments made by the auto companies in new, more fuel-efficient vehicles, and the significant investments that we have made in the partnership for a new generation of vehicles? Do we want to derail those efforts as a result of this type of action? 
   In my judgment, we should say yes to more safe vehicles; we should say yes to American autoworkers; we should say yes to the technological advances that have been and are continuing to be made. That is ultimately how we are going to have more fuel-efficient vehicles. If we say yes to all of those, then, in my judgment, we must say no to this amendment because to have a Washington bureaucracy made up of unelected individuals who impose upon this very significant sector of our economy these kinds of standards, the likely outcome will be exactly the opposite of what I have proposed today. I think it will hurt our economy and the American automobile industry, although it may help the automobile industries of other countries. I think it will make the vehicles that come about as a result of higher standards less safe, as the studies that we have cited here today demonstrate. 
   So for those reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote against the Gorton-Bryan-Feinstein amendment.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to express my sincere congratulations to the Arab American Cultural and Community Center in Houston, Texas. The Center will be hosting its Fourth Annual Gala ``Unity of Friendship'' in Houston on October 16, 1999, and it is worthy of recognition. 
   Mr. President, I commend those who have strived so hard to build this Center and make it a vibrant part of the community in Texas. This is an important effort which has advanced and demonstrated the continuing positive contributions of Arab-Americans. This Center has served as a cultural resource center for all nationalities in Houston, but is a special place where Arab-American culture, art, and language can be preserved and carried on for generations to come. It has assisted the children in the Arab American community by teaching them about their ancestors' impressive history and heritage. 
   I am pleased to recognize the efforts of those involved in this year's banquet and to note that they are generously donating a portion of the proceeds to help very worthwhile humanitarian projects. They are to be commended for their efforts and foresight, and I am pleased to acknowledge them in the United States Senate.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, It gives me great pleasure to rise today and honor two outstanding Republican visionaries and admired civic leaders, Mr. and Mrs. Peter and Pat Cook, on the occasion of the Gerald R. Ford Republican Women's Club, Annual Fall Reception on September 13, 1999. 
   Peter Cook began his professional career with Import Motors Limited Inc., where he was named President in 1954. In 1977, with his typical entrepreneurial spirit and innovative thinking, Peter Cook formed Transitional Motors Inc., also known as Mazda Great Lakes, where he currently sits as chairman of the board and majority stockholder. Additionally, Mr. Cook serves on the boards for numerous companies, most notably, Gospel Communications, Woodland International, Applied Image Technology and the new Van Andel Institute. In the past he served as chairman of the South Y.M.C.A. and the Kent County Republican Finance Committee. 
   Pat Cook has always been very supportive of her husband's career. In the late 1950's she took it upon herself to help deliver some of the first Volkswagens to dealers in Midland and Detroit. After the birth of their two children, Tom and Steve, Mrs. Cook stayed at home and continued in a voluntary capacity to enrich her community. She has served on the boards of Welcome Home for the Blind, Blodgett Hospital Guild and Porter Hills Ladies Auxiliary. 
   Perhaps what is most truly admirable and wonderful about Mr. and Mrs. Cook is their dedication to helping the lives of others and the Grand Rapids community. They made the leading gift establishing the Research and Education Institute of Butterworth Hospital. Mr. and Mrs. Cook are active members of the Grace Reformed Church and much of their support is focused toward youth and Christian institutions. They have helped make possible the construction of the carillon on the Grand Valley State University campus; they have worked with Aquinas College students in making a new Student Center; and they have also contributed greatly to the Hope College Student Housing Center and Cook Valley Estates for the Porter Hills Presbyterian Village. 
   Mr. and Mrs. Cook lead their lives as an example to others by being strong Christians, distinguished philanthropists, and dedicated citizens. Their countless efforts and support will continue to benefit the community for many years to come. 
   Mr. President it is with sincere joy and appreciation that I honor Peter and Pat Cook. Rarely do you see two people who have unselfishly done so much to help others.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a brief colloquy with the Majority Leader regarding the New Millennium Classrooms Act. Last week, the Abraham-Wyden New Millennium Classrooms Act amendment the the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 was cleared on both sides of the aisle and accepted by the full United States Senate. This bill provided tax incentives for businesses to donate both new and used computers to K-12 schools and senior centers. The Senate's approval of this amendment demonstrates our strong commitment to provide school children--especially those children who live in impoverished areas--access to up-to-date computer technology and the Internet. Unfortunately, despite the Senate's strong support for this measure, I understand that it was opposed by the House conferees to the Taxpayer Refund Act.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Date Rape Drug Control Act of 1999. This legislation will address a growing epidemic in our land that is taking too many lives. 
   Mr. President, so-called date-rape drugs are becoming increasingly common in our nation. These drugs, so named because they are used in order to incapacitate women and make them vulnerable to sexual assault, are finding their way into nightclubs, onto campuses and into homes. They are being used by sexual predators against young--sometimes very young--women. The results are terrible and often tragic. Women victimized by drugs like gamma hydroxybutyric acid (or GHB) and Ketamine may be raped, they may become violently ill, and they may die. 
   Mr. President, I'd like to give just one example of the horrible consequences of drugs like GHB and Ketamine. In January of this year three young girls, none of them yet 16, were at a party given by a 25 year-old man in Woodhaven, Michigan. 15 year-old Samantha Reid drank a Mountain Dew--a soft drink--and passed out within minutes. She vomited in her sleep, and she died. Her friend, Melanie Sindone, also 15, passed out and lapsed into a coma, but has fortunately survived. The third young woman, Jessica VanWassehnova, had traces of GHB in her blood and only had a minor reaction of nausea. The three teenage boys are now facing manslaughter and felony poison charges. 
   These two girls had no reason to believe that they were drinking anything dangerous. But they were wrong. Their drinks had been laced with both GHB and Ketamine. Men at the party apparently put these drugs in the girls' drinks, to a tragic result. 
   Mr. President, this was a terrible series of events, and one that has been repeated far too many times. Our young women are being raped and killed by sexual predators using GHB and Ketamine. And that must stop. 
   The Date Rape Drug Control Act will provide law enforcement personnel with the tools they need to fight the date-rape epidemic. It directs that GHB and Ketamine be classified as Schedule I controlled substances, as drugs like heroin and cocaine are today. In addition, the bill authorizes additional reporting requirements that will enhance the ability of authorities to track the manufacture, distribution and dispensing of GHB and similar products. And it directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to submit annual reports to Congress estimating the number of incidents of date-rape drug abuse that occurred during the most recent year for which data are available. 
   Finally, Mr. President, this bill requires the Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General, to develop a plan for carrying out a national campaign to educate individuals about the dangers of date-rape drugs, the fact that they are controlled substances and the penalties involved for violating the Controlled Substances Act, how to recognize symptoms indicating that an individual may be a victim of date-rape drugs, and how to respond when an individual has these symptoms.  
   The last provision is crucial, Mr. President, because those who use date-rape drugs depend on stealth in praying upon their victims. Young women who are on the look-out, who know what to look for and can recognize the signs of date-rape drug use will be at much lower risk of falling victim to GHB or Ketamine. 
   It is time to act, Mr. President, to save young people, and young women in particular, from these deadly drugs and from the predators who use them. I ask my colleagues to give this important legislation their full support.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the INS Reform and Border Security Act. Today, there is widespread agreement that the Immigration and Naturalization Service does not handle either its service or its law enforcement functions well. On the enforcement side, the INS has shown an inability to recruit, hire, and retain the Border Patrol agents mandated by Congress. The agency's detention policies are at best inconsistent. Its computer systems and methods for tracking and deporting criminal aliens has proven inadequate. And the list could continue. On the service side, the situation is similarly troubling. Stories of lost files, misplaced fingerprints, and broken-hearted applicants are far too common. Congressional offices are overwhelmed with the number of requests from constituents seeking help with their cases at INS. The INS is generally unable to update an individual on the status of his or her case. Any the backlogs have become so lengthy at the INS that few can anticipate action on their case, whether for citizenship or adjustment of status, within 18 months. The system is broken. 
   In the February 1999 Government Performance Project report, administered by the Syracuse University, the INS came in dead last among 15 federal agencies. INS received an overall grade of C-, while gathering grades of D in both management and human resources, and C in information technology. These grades were perhaps generous. A DOJ Inspector General report recently concluded that the INS ``still does not adequately manage'' its computer system and expressed concerns that much money has been wasted on an $800 million computer system. 
   The current structure of the INS--concentrated in District Offices around the country that combine service and enforcement functions--is a cause of a number of its problems. These offices are run by District Directors who are not required to have law enforcement backgrounds. Moreover, they can hold their posts for 15 years or more, resulting in ``fiefdoms'' that make it difficult to improve service or enforcement, or for headquarters to receive adherence from the field for policy changes. By combining the service and enforcement functions in one entity, the agency has taken on dual missions that in many ways are incompatible. Serious problems have resulted in expecting the INS to be the good service provider by day in facilitating legal immigration and naturalization, and the tough ``cop'' by night combating illegal immigration and criminal aliens. This is a point I made in my first speech as chairman of the immigration subcommittee and it remains my view today. Permitting the INS to move forward with its current structure and organization only ensures an endless recurrence of the same problems we have seen for years at the agency. 
   The INS Reform and Border Security Act would represent fundamental change. It would eliminate the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The legislation will create a new Immigration Affairs Agency within the Justice Department, led by an Associate Attorney General for Immigration Affairs, that will contain two separate bureaus--The Bureau of Immigration Service and Adjudication (BISA) and the Bureau of Enforcement and Border Affairs (BEBA). This will allow for concentrated effort and personnel devoted to improving their respective service and enforcement functions. Inspections, which has a combined service and enforcement function, will be a separate entity within the Immigration Affairs Agency. 
   The legislation would also increase accountability by creating three Senate-confirmed positions, one each for the Associate Attorney General for Immigration Affairs, the Director of 
   the Service Bureau and the Director of the Enforcement Bureau. The bill would also create the position of Chief Financial Officer in both the Service and Enforcement bureaus, creating additional fiscal accountability. 
   The bill will ensure the coordination of important functions. Specifically, by ensuring that an Associate Attorney General for Immigration Affairs will be in charge, the formulation and coordination of policy between the Service and Enforcement Bureaus will take place. There is a risk that without an individual charged with policy coordination, policy anarchy could ensue. 
   The legislation will provide for enhanced enforcement of our immigration laws. Separating out enforcement will help ensure that enforcement is sufficiently supported and that individuals overseeing enforcement functions possess a law enforcement background. Moreover, the bill would move the Enforcement Bureau toward the best practices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is considered a more effective law enforcement entity than the current INS. The FBI is successful in coordinating activities between the central office and field offices and in supporting agents in the fields, which are vital for sound law enforcement. Finally, the bill would require the addition of 1,000 more border patrol in fiscal years 2002, 2003, and 2004. 
   The INS Reform and Border Security Act should result in important service improvements. Separating service and enforcement will help ensure that those individuals working in the service side understand their jobs to include the fair, equitable, accurate, and courteous service. In fact, the legislation requires that all employee evaluations include the fair and equitable treatment of immigrants as a top priority. The legislation creates the Office of the Ombudsman, which will assist individuals in resolving service or case problems and identify and propose changes in the Service Bureau to improve service. The Ombudsman can appoint local representatives to resolve serious service breakdowns. In addition, the legislation models the Service Bureau's organization on the Social Security Administration by creating regional commissioners and area directors charged with service implementation. The bill would place statutory time limits on the processing of temporary visas and visas for permanent residence and seeks to ensure that services are adequately funded.  
   To improve the culture of employees, the bill includes a series of measures, including employee buyouts and the ability to bring in outside management executives, that are modeled on those passed by Congress in the 1998 IRS reform bill. 
   The legislation has already achieved a great consensus, having been endorsed by the U.S. Border Patrol Chief Patrol Agent's Association, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the American Immigration Lawyers Association, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, and other organizations.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mrs. Marilee Smiley of Fenton, MI in recognition of her service as Supreme Guardian of the International Order of Job's Daughters. I extend to her my heartfelt congratulations for her service. 
   Marilee Smiley is a woman who has consistently demonstrated her commitment to the ideals of Masonry and the International Order of Job's Daughters. This exemplary organization is dedicated to instilling in young women, age eleven to twenty, the character traits necessary for success as human beings and citizens of our great land. In this quest, Mrs. Smiley has contributed her very best, and the young women she has so ably guided have been the beneficiaries. 
   Marilee Smiley has had tremendous impact not only in MI, but nationally and internationally. A woman of high principles, Marilee has utilized her intelligence, concern for youth, belief in humanity, and leadership abilities to serve others through participation in the International Order of Job's Daughters for forty-three years. As a youth she held various offices, including Honored Queen of Bethel No. 30, and the Grand Blanc and Michigan Grand Bethel Representative to California. As an adult leader she also held various offices in Bethel No. 30 of Grand Blanc, Bethel No. 50 of Lansing-Okemos, and Bethel No. 58 of Lansing, including serving as Bethel Guardian of Bethels No. 1, 2, 50, and 58. 
   Marilee Smiley has exemplified the character traits taught to her as a young woman in her continuing association with the International Order of Job's Daughters. As an adult leader, she was awarded the Triangle of Honor, the highest honor that the Grand Council of Michigan can bestow an adult leader. 
   This fine lady has also held several positions with the Grand Guardian Council of Michigan of the International Order of Job's Daughters, serving as Grand Guardian during the 1982-83 year. 
   She has continued her service to the International Order of Job's Daughters, holding several positions with the Supreme Council. Her services have included several committee offices, including serving the Board of Trustees from 1992 through 1995, and currently serving as Supreme Guardian of the International Order of Job's Daughters, the highest position an adult leader may hold. 
   Along with her work with the International Order of Job's Daughters, Marilee raised three wonderful children with her husband Ken. She taught them the importance of being involved in the community as well as volunteering. She was actively involved with Swim Clubs and Swim Boosters as all of her children swam competitively year-round. 
   Marilee Smiley deserves the highest tribute in recognition of her service as Supreme Guardian of the International Order of Job's Daughters.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in memory of a dear friend, Madeleine Anne Thomas, who tragically drowned during a rafting trip on June 22. I also want to pay tribute today to her husband and children who were with her on that day. I feel extremely fortunate to have known Madeleine as a friend. I know that she will be missed by many. 
   Madeleine Thomas had a propensity for helping people. This desire led her to specialize as a lawyer in the areas of domestic relations, small business law, and civil and criminal litigation. Her top priorities were cases involving children--she served as the court referee for the Wexford and Missaukee County Circuit Courts. In this capacity, she heard and ruled on all issues concerning child support, child custody, visitation, paternity, and alimony for the Circuit Court. 
   Ms. Thomas was also influential in the advancement of women in her field. She was the first woman president of her local county bar association and she led the way in promoting equality by showing others that she could accomplish that which no other woman had.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Veterans of WWII from Whitehall and Montague, Michigan, on the occasion of the Restoration and Dedication of the WWII Monument in Whitehall, Michigan. 
   We as a country cannot thank enough the men and women of the armed forces who have served our country. The very things that make America great today we owe in large part to the Veterans of WWII as well as our Veterans of other wars. The bravery and courage that these young people showed in defending our nation is a tribute to the upbringing they received in Whitehall and Montague. While these men clearly are outstanding in their home towns, they also have contributed greatly to the freedom of all Americans. 
   These great men put everything aside for their country. They put their families and education aside for the good of democracy. 
   Some of them even gave their lives. 
   On August 14, 1999, there will be a WWII Monument Rededication honoring the Whitehall and Montague Veterans. At that time, their communities will, in a small but significant way, thank them for the sacrifices they made to keep us free. 
   I would like to take this opportunity to join the people of Whitehall and Montague in honoring all of their citizens who fought for our country. Furthermore, I would like to pay special tribute to those men who gave their lives for our country by listing them in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today in order to comment on S. 1255, the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act of 1999. Through the tremendous help of several of my colleagues, notably Senators HATCH, LEAHY, TORRICELLI, MCCAIN, BREAUX, and LOTT, we moved this bill in little over one month from a concept to final product, through the Judiciary Committee with unanimous support, and again with unanimous support through the Senate floor. I thank all involved for their help, and I am comfortable in my belief that we have accomplished a great feat here today: the Senate has taken an important step in reforming trademark law for the digital age, and in protecting the expectations and safety of consumers, and the property rights of business nationwide. 
   This legislation will combat a new form of high-tech fraud that is causing confusion and inconvenience for consumers, increasing costs for people doing business on the Internet, and posing substantial threat to a century of pre-Internet American business efforts. The fraud is commonly called ``cybersquatting,'' a practice whereby individuals in bad faith reserve Internet domain names or other identifiers of online locations that are similar or identical to trademarked names. Once a trademark is registered as an online identifier or domain name, the ``cybersquatter'' can engage in a variety of nefarious activities--from the relatively benign parody of a business or individual, to the obscene prank of redirecting an unsuspecting consumer to pornographic content, to the destructive worldwide slander of a centuries-old brand name. This behavior undermines consumer confidence, discourages Internet use, and destroys the value of established brand names and trademarks. 
   Electronic of ``E'' commerce in particular has been an engine of great economic growth for the United States. E-commerce between businesses has grown to an estimated $64.8 billion for 1999. Ten million customers shopped for some product using the Internet in 1998 alone. International Data Corporation estimates that $31 billion in products will be sold over the Internet in 1999. And 5.3 million households will have access to financial transactions like banking and stock trading by the end of 1999. 
   Our economy, and its ability to provide high paying jobs for American workers, is increasingly dependent upon technology--and on e-commerce in particular. If we want to maintain our edge in the global marketplace, we must address those problems which endanger continued growth in e-commerce. Some unscrupulous--though enterprising--people are engaged in the thriving and unethical business collecting and selling Internet addresses containing trademarked names. 
   Cybersquatting has already caused significant damage. Even computer-savvy companies buy domain names from cybersquatters at extortionate rates to rid themselves of a headache with no certain outcome. For example, computer maker Gateway recently paid $100,000 to a cybersquatter who had placed pornographic images on the website ``www.gateway20000''. But rather than simply give up, several companies, including Paine Webber, have instead sought protection of their brands through the legal system. However, as with much of the pre-Internet law that is applied to this post-Internet world, precedent is still developing, and at this point, one cannot predict with certainty which party to a dispute will win, and on what grounds, in the future. 
   Whether perpetrated to defraud the public or to extort the trademark owner, squatting on Internet addresses using trademarked names is wrong. Trademark law is based on the recognition that companies and individuals build a property right in brand names because of the reasonable expectations they raise among consumers. If you order a Compaq or Apple computer, that should mean that you get a computer made by Compaq or Apple, not one built by a fly-by-night company pirating the name. The same goes for trademarks on the Internet. 
   To protect Internet growth and job production, Senators TORRICELLI, HATCH, MCCAIN, and I introduced an anticybersquatting bill which received strong public support. A number of suggestions convinced me of the need  for substitute legislation addressing the problem of in rem jurisdiction and eliminating provisions dealing with criminal penalties, and I have been pleased to work with Senators HATCH and LEAHY to that effect. 
   Our final legislative product would establish uniform federal rules for dealing with this attack on interstate electronic commerce, supplementing existing rights under trademark law. It establishes a civil action for registering, trafficking in, or using a domain name identifier that is identical to, confusingly similar to, or dilutive of another person's trademark or service mark that either is inherently distinctive or had acquired distinctiveness. 
   This bill also incorporates substantial protections for innocent parties, keying on the bad faith of a party. Civil liability would attach only if a person had no intellectual property rights in the domain name identifier, the domain name identifier was not the person's legal first name or surname; and the person registered, acquired, or used the domain name identifier with the bad-faith intent to benefit from the goodwill of a trademark or service mark of another. 
   Just to be clear on our intent, the ``bad-faith'' requirement may be established by, among others, any of the following evidence: 
   First, if the registration or use of the domain name identifier was made with the intent to disrupt the business of the mark owner by diverting consumers from the mark owner's online location; 
   Second, if a pattern is established of the person offering to transfer, sell, or otherwise assign more than one domain name identifier to the owner of the applicable mark or any third party for consideration, without having used the domain name identifiers in the bona fide offering of any goods or services; or 
   Third, if the person registers or acquires multiple domain name identifiers that are identical to, confusingly similar to, or dilutive of any distinctive trademark or service mark of one or more other persons. 
   In addition, under this legislation, the owner of a mark may bring an in rem action against the domain name identifier itself. This will allow a court to order the forfeiture or cancellation of the domain name identifier or the transfer of the domain name identifier to the owner of the mark. It also reinforces the central characteristic of this legislation--its intention to protect property rights. The in rem provision will eliminate the problem most recently and prominently experienced by the auto maker Porsche, which had an action against several infringing domain name identifiers dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction. 
   In terms of damages, this legislation provides for statutory civil damages of at least $1,000, but not more than $100,000 per domain name identifier. The plaintiff may elect these damages in lieu of actual damages or profits at any time before final judgment. 
   The growth of the Internet has provided businesses and individuals with unprecedented access to a worldwide source of information, commerce, and community. Unfortunately, those bad actors seeking to cause harm to businesses and individuals have seen their opportunities increase as well. In my opinion, on-line extortion in this form is unacceptable and outrageous. Whether it's people extorting companies by registering company names, misdirect Internet users to inappropriate sites, or otherwise attempting to damage a trademark that a business has spent decades building into a recognizable brand, persons engaging in cybersquatting activity should be held accountable for their actions. I believe that these provisions will discourage anyone from ``squatting'' on addresses in cyberspace to which they are not entitled. 
   I again wish to thank my colleagues for their assistance in this effort, and I look forward to final passage of this legislation after careful and thoughtful consideration by the House of Representatives.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, this amendment funds a special research grant for the study of Bovine Tuberculosis by the Agricultural Experiment Station at Michigan State University. This special research grant will fund the study of methods of transmission of Bovine TB and will also look toward developing vaccines and possibly a cure. 
   In order to fund this grant, I propose to reduce funding for Competitive research grants within the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES). Specifically, I intend to take this offset from Animal systems account. 
   In the past year, Bovine TB has spread from the oversized deer population in the north to a number of herds in Michigan's northern lower peninsula. The spread of this disease threatens Michigan's TB-free status and must be controlled as soon as possible. I urge my colleagues to support this effort.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Holocaust Era Assets Tax Exclusion Act amendment to the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1999. I am pleased that this amendment was cleared on both sides of the aisle and has been accepted by the full United States Senate. The passage of the Abraham-Fitzgerald-Moynihan-Schumer Holocaust Era Assets Tax Exclusion Act amendment by unanimous consent, demonstrates beyond shadow of a doubt the United States Senate's firm solidarity with those who suffered during the Holocaust. In addition, I would like to offer my sincere gratitude to Chairman ROTH for his leadership and support during this process, without which we might not have had this opportunity to pass such important legislation. 
   The passing decades have not obscured the horrors of the Nazi regime and the horrors it committed during its 12 years in power. Many people in America and around the world live every day with memories of atrocities they suffered during this terrible time. Rounded up, placed in ghettoes or death camps, left to starve or tortured and murdered, millions had their lives taken from them, figuratively and literally. 
   We must never forget these atrocities. Thanks to the hard work of many, particularly within the Jewish community, we have numerous reminders of this inhumanity which can and should increase our awareness and our commitment to preventing any such events from occurring ever again. But there is more that we must do. Only recently has public attention been properly directed toward another great crime of the Nazi regime and those who cooperated with it: the systematic looting of Jewish economic assets. In addition to committing outright theft and looting, the Nazis seized liquid assets that could be converted easily into cash, such as insurance policy proceeds and bank accounts. Documents discovered over the past several years show that the Nazis specifically targeted insurance policies held by Jews as a source of funding for their expansionist, totalitarian regime. 
   I am sorry to say that some insurance companies also specifically (and illegally) targeted Jewish families. Knowing that Jewish policy holders soon would be taken to concentration camps, these firms sold specifically tailored policies, taking as much cash as possible up front, with no intention of honoring their obligations. 
   After the war, Holocaust survivors struggling to restart their lives tried to collect on their policies, access their bank accounts and/or reclaim assets that had been illegally seized from them. Unfortunately, governments, banks, and insurance companies failed to fulfill their duty to treat Holocaust victims with justice and dignity. Instead, they refused to honor policies or return stolen assets. In this way, survivors of the Holocaust were victimized  twice, first by the Nazis, then by the financial institutions that deprived them of their assets. 
   Today, after over 50 years of injustice, Holocaust survivors and their families are finally reclaiming what is rightfully theirs. It is high time these victims of oppression finally got back some of the property stolen from them. It also is time, in my view, that the rest of us stood up to protect them from further raids on their assets. Under current law, any money received by Holocaust survivors in their settlements with banks and other organizations that once cooperated with the Nazis is treated as gross income for federal tax purposes. And that's just plain wrong. 
   My colleagues and I offer this amendment to prevent the federal government from imposing income tax on any settlement payments, received by Holocaust survivors or their families resulting from a Holocaust claim. We do so because we feel it is morally imperative that we stand with the victims of this injustice, and that this nation not treat as income what is in fact the return of what had been stolen. 
   Specifically, our amendment would allow a Holocaust survivor or the surviving heirs to receive a tax exemption for any monies received as payment resulting from a Holocaust claim from any international fund for survivors. 
   This would include settlements from the action ``In re Holocaust Victims' Asset Litigation'' or any other similar lawsuit, including actions already settled. 
   Also included would be the value of any land recovered from a foreign government as a result of a settlement arising out of the illegal confiscation of such land in connection with the Holocaust. 
   The victims of the Holocaust have suffered far too much for any such taxation to be just. These settlements represent but a fraction of what is owed to those who suffered under Nazi tyranny. To treat them as income subject to taxation would be to add a new injury to the old. 
   Mr. President, we cannot undo the evil acts of the Nazi regime. But we can put ourselves firmly on the side of those who suffered so unjustly by passing this amendment. By excluding Holocaust settlement monies from taxation, we will show that we understand what justice demands of us as we face the continuing consequences of an unjust regime.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the New Millennium Classrooms Act amendment to the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1999. I am pleased that this amendment was cleared on both sides of the aisle and has been accepted by the full United States Senate. The passage of the Abraham-Wyden New Millennium Classrooms Act amendment by unanimous consent, demonstrates beyond shadow of a doubt that the United States Senate is firmly committed to bringing quality high technology to schools and seniors. This provision will go a long way toward ensuring our nation's technological and economic leadership in the New Economy. 
   First, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Chairman for his leadership and support during this process, without which we might not have had this opportunity to pass such important legislation. In addition, I would like to express my thanks to Senator WYDEN who has worked closely with me to develop this strong legislation which would bridge the digital divide between technological haves and have-nots, ensuring that all our nation's students, and seniors, enjoy access to quality technology and the Internet. 
   When I first introduced this legislation, I was joined by Senators WYDEN, HATCH, KERREY, COVERDELL, DASCHLE, JEFFORDS, LIEBERMAN, ALLARD, GORTON, BURNS, and MCCONNELL. Like me, they believe it will encourage companies and individuals to donate more computers to schools, helping these institutions train kids for jobs in the fast-growing high technology sector of our economy. Since then we have been joined by 14 additional colleagues from both sides of the aisle. 
   Mr. President, our kids must be prepared for the jobs of the 21st century, which requires training and experience with computers and the Internet. Unfortunately, not enough schools have the equipment they need to teach the essential skills our kids and our nation need to keep our economic future bright. 
   Education Secretary Riley recently testified before the Joint Economic Committee, saying that he expects us to see 70 percent growth in computer and technology-related jobs in the next six years alone. In less then six months, 60 percent of all jobs will require computers. 
   However, Mr. President, our classrooms have too few computers. And the computers they do have are so old and outdated that they cannot run the most basic software or even access the Internet. One of the more common computers in our schools today is the Apple IIc, a model so archaic it is now on display at the Smithsonian. 
   Mr. President, the problem is even worse for those already disadvantaged. A recent Commerce Department report, Falling through the Net: Defining the Digital Divide'' shows a growing divide between technological haves and have-nots. Among the study's findings: 
   The gap between white and black/Hispanic households with incomes between $15-$35,000 per year has increased, from 8% five years ago to 13% today. 
   Households with annual incomes of at least $75,000 are more than 20 times as likely to have Internet access than households at the lowest income levels. 
   All this points up the need to encourage access to the Internet from computers outside the home. Access translates into usage, then experience and knowledge. Bringing high technology to schools, especially schools in economically disadvantaged areas, and senior centers will provide students and seniors the opportunity to succeed in the next millennium that they might not have had otherwise. 
   The Detwiler Foundation, an organization with unparalleled status as a facilitator of computer donations to K-12 schools nationwide, estimates that if just 10 percent of the computers taken out of service each year were donated to schools, the national ratio of students to computers would be brought down to five to one, or even less. 
   Mr. President, this amendment, through tax incentives, would increase the amount of computer technology donated to schools. 
   Our amendment would do the following: 
   First, allow a tax credit equal to 30 percent of the fair market value of the donated computer equipment, including computers, peripheral equipment, software and fiber optic cable related to computer use, generally, and a 50 percent credit for donations made within designated empowerment zones, enterprise communities, and Indian reservations. Increasing the amount of the tax credits for donations made to schools and senior centers in economically-distressed areas will increase the availability of computers to the children and seniors who need them most. 
   Second, increase the age limit to include equipment three years old or less. Many companies update their equipment every 3 to 5 years. Yet three year old computers equipped with Pentium-based or equivalent chips have the processing power, memory, and graphics capabilities to provide sufficient Internet and multi-media access and run any necessary software. 
   Third, expand the pool of eligible donors. By expanding the number of donors eligible for the tax credit we can increase the number of computers available as well. 
   In addition, this amendment would require that donated computers include an installed operating system. Sophisticated hardware can be easily damaged during transport or even when the donating company's private files and documents are removed. Without the operating system, it could be weeks before the school is aware of any problems concerning the donation. Further, inclusion of an operating system will ensure that students can begin using the machines as soon as they are plugged in, without further burdening school budgets with the added purchasing costs of an operating system and license. 
   This amendment has been endorsed by: the National Association of Secondary School Principals, Microsoft, The Information Technology Industry Council, The National Association of Manufacturers, The Technology Training Tax Credit Coalition, 11 senior executives of leading technology companies and venture capital firms, The National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges, TechNet, and the United States Chamber of Commerce. 
   All of these organizations agree that this amendment will provide powerful tax incentives for businesses to donate high-tech equipment to our classrooms. 
   Mr. President, without duly increasing federal expenditures or creating yet another federal program or department this amendment will give all our children an equal chance to succeed in the new millennium. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, this amendment tries to address what I consider to be one of the shortfalls in the Senate Finance Committee's tax bill. This tax bill does not include any provisions to reduce the capital gains tax rate. I believe we need to address the needs of America's growing investor class through mutual funds, pension plans, IRAs and other investment vehicles about 50 percent of Americans have. Half the Nation's population own stocks and other financial assets. 
   I believe it is time to put to rest once and for all the old class warfare slogan that only the rich pay capital gains taxes. Forty-nine percent of the investor class are women, and 38 percent are nonprofessional, salaried workers. Wall Street and Main Street are no longer separated. I believe it is time we recognize this fact and help new middle-class investors succeed in their drive to invest and save for the future. 
   I think it is time to cut the tax on mutual funds and pensions for working Americans and, therefore, I have offered this amendment which is a sense of the Senate suggesting we should, in the conference that will follow the passage of this legislation, recede to the House position which reduces capital gains tax rates.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, my motion to recommit is the substitute tax plan submitted by Majority Leader LOTT in the Finance Committee. I will not request a vote on this motion. 
   I commend the efforts of Chairman ROTH in putting together the Taxpayer Refund Act. However, it is my belief that Congress right now has a unique opportunity to enact broad-based tax cuts, providing more pro-growth and pro-family relief than is currently provided in the Finance Committee bill. 
   This substitute combines the elements I believe are essential to preserving economic security for years to come: It preserves Social Security and Medicare; It reduces the near-record tax burden currently placed on the American people; and It empowers America's growing investor class--working, middle class families who strive to save for the future so that they may enjoy secure retirements and so that they can bequeath a legacy to their children. 
   All this, Mr. President, without greatly increasing the complexity of the tax code. 
   Over the next 10 years the federal government will accumulate surpluses of about $3 trillion. Now that the age of surpluses has arrived, we must decide what to do with them, how we can best use them to insure economic growth and security into the next millennium. 
   Thus, of the $3 trillion in coming surpluses, the $1.8 trillion for the Social Security Trust Funds must be protected; it must stay in Social Security. The question is, what should we do with the remaining $1 trillion? 
   I believe that we should give at least $800 billion back to the American people. Whatever plan we adopt, it seems to me we must ensure that Social Security remains strong so that the senior citizens of today and tomorrow may depend on it for security in their old age. We also must approach our national debt in a responsible way seeing to it that it never again becomes a drain on our economy. And, also for the sake of our economy, we must see to it that investments in plant, equipment and human capital increase over the coming decades. Finally, we must address a worsening problem in American life: the overtaxation of the American people. 
   The President's plan addresses none of these needs. It does nothing to save Social Security, instead merely commencing a vast shell game with taxpayer money. What is more, the President proposes massive new spending, and even $95 billion in new taxes. 
   The bottom line is this, Mr. President Clinton wants to spend the surplus. According to the CBO, the President proposes $1 trillion in new spending over the next 10 years. That would mean taking $29 billion out of the Social Security Trust Fund surplus. 
   Now I know some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been quoting from Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan's recent Congressional testimony. In that testimony, Chairman Greenspan said ``My first priority, if I were given such a priority, is to let the surpluses run.'' 
   Some of my colleagues have been claiming that, in these words, Chairman Greenspan has rejected tax relief for the American people. But this is simply not so, Mr. President. Any reasonable examination of the record would show Chairman Greenspan's true views on the matter, namely that he would delay tax cuts ``unless, as I've indicated many times, it appears that the surplus is going to become a lightening rod for major increases in outlays. That's the worst of all possible worlds, from a fiscal policy point of view, and that, under all conditions, should be avoided.'' 
   Chairman Greenspan was not saying ``I oppose tax cuts.'' Rather, he was saying, quite reasonably in my view, that tax cuts must not come at the expense of fiscal and monetary stability. 
   I agree with Chairman Greenspan that tax cuts cannot be our first priority. Our first priority must be to protect Social Security and address the national debt. Which is exactly what this substitute does by setting aside more than half our projected surpluses for those purposes. 
   At the same time, we cannot allow these surpluses to become ``lightning rods'' for yet more increases in the size and scope of government, and in the tax burden on the American people. And that is precisely what the President's plan would do; it would spend the surplus, including the Social Security surplus, on further government programs, leaving nothing for the American people. 
   That is simply wrong. And I was pleased to learn that Chairman Greenspan agrees. In his testimony he said ``I have great sympathy for those who wish to cut taxes now to pre-empt that [spending] process, and indeed, if it turns out that they are right, then I would say moving on the tax front makes a good deal of sense to me.'' 
   It makes a great deal of sense, Mr. President, for us to set aside the bulk of the surplus for Social Security and debt relief, then to return the rest to the American people. It makes a great deal of sense for us, after reserving over $2 trillion for these essential functions to return $800 billion to the American people, as a refund of their tax overpayment. 
   I believe we are doing the right thing by giving 25 cents back to the American people for every surplus dollar. I believe the plan crafted by those on the other side of the aisle is wrong to give back only 10 cents on each surplus dollar. 
   Let me briefly outline the provisions of this substitute, crafted as I said by majority Leader LOTT. It includes: 
   Broad-based rate cuts, expanding the 15% tax bracket upwards by $10,000. 
   Family tax relief, including an end to the marriage penalty and provisions for child care and foster care. 
   An end to the estate or death tax. 
   Incentives for savings and investments, including exclusions for interest and dividend income and a cut in individual capital gains rates to 15% and 7.5%. 
   Retirement savings incentives through an increase in the IRA contribution limit to $5,000 per year. 
   Education incentives, including education savings accounts, student loan interest deductions and prepaid tuition plans for public and private schools. 
   Provisions making health care more affordable, including a new deduction for health insurance expenses, long-term care provisions, Medical Savings Accounts, and an additional caretaker dependency deduction. 
   Small business tax relief, including immediate 100% deductibility of health insurance for the self-employed and in increase in small business expensing to $30,000. 
   Risk management accounts for farmers and ranchers.  
   Permanent extension of the Research and Development tax credit, and 
   An extension of the work opportunity credit and welfare to work credit. 
   I would like to focus on the provisions in this substitute that I believe differentiate it from the Finance Committee legislation; provisions that in my view provide even more pro-family and pro-growth tax relief where it is most needed. 
   First is family tax relief. Families today pay a higher proportion of their incomes in taxes than ever before in our history--31.7 percent. They pay more in income taxes than at any time since World War II. They spend more on taxes than on food, clothing and shelter combined. And this tax burden leaves families with less money to spend on necessities, and less to save for their retirement and for their children's education. 
   Families deserve tax relief, particularly at a time when they are overpaying to the tune of over a trillion dollars. 
   This substitute will give families the substantive tax break they need and deserve. 
   First, it includes broad-based tax relief by increasing the amount of income a family can earn while remaining in the 15% income tax bracket by $10,000. The figure for single taxpayers will increase by $5,000. In this way, Mr. President, we will return 7 million taxpayers to the lower, 15% tax bracket, and 35 million taxpayers will receive a tax cut. 
   Under this proposal, even a single filer would save $550 on his or her taxes. 
   In addition, this substitute ends the marriage penalty and provides relief for child and foster care services. 
   Taken together, these provisions will directly reduce the tax rate imposed on American families and increase incentives for work and economic growth. 
   Second, this substitute will provide tax relief to literally millions of working Americans struggling to build a nest egg for the future. By cutting taxes on interest, dividends and capital gains. 
   This latest era of economic growth has been unique, Mr. President, in that it has seen savings rates fall into negative numbers--indicating an increase in consumer borrowing in excess of savings. We cannot sustain economic growth and job creation unless Americans save and invest for the future. 
   That is why this substitute will address the needs of America's growing ``investor class.'' These working Americans--125 million and counting--are the real owners of the means of production in America. 
   Surveys conducted by a number of sources agree that, through pension plans, IRAs and other investment vehicles, roughly 50% of Americans--half our nation--owns stocks. They outnumber any of the special interest groups you would care to name. Yet they want no special favors, just the opportunity to save and invest. And, with $4.5 trillion invested in mutual funds alone, America's investor class has become the bedrock of our economy. 
   It is time to put to rest once and for all the old class warfare slogan that only the rich pay capital gains taxes. Is half of America ``rich?'' Do half our people earn so much money that they do not deserve a tax relief? 
   I think not. Indeed, 49% of the investor class if female, 38% are non-professional salaried workers. Wall Street and Main Street are no longer separated by a vast socioeconomic divide. It is high time we recognized this fact, and helped new, middle class investors succeed in their drive to invest for the future. 
   This substitute would do precisely that, Mr. President. It would make the first $500 of interest and/or dividend income tax-free for families, with the first $250 of this income becoming tax-free for individuals. It also would increase the IRA contribution limit to $5,000 per year, allowing Americans to more effectively save for retirement. Finally, it would cut capital gains tax rates, reducing the current 20 and 10% tax brackets to 15 and 7.5%, respectively. 
   Of course, not all of nation's economic growth comes from stock investment. Many entrepreneurs in this country invest their blood, tears, toil and sweat into family owned businesses--businesses that keep our main streets vital and our economy growing. 
   Our nation was built on the strength of family-owned businesses. Whether on the frontier or in more settled urban areas, family businesses have delivered the goods for generations. Yet the federal government sets up almost insurmountable obstacles to family businesses. 
   The death tax makes it impossible for many entrepreneurs to pass the business on to their children. Too often today, children must sell the family business just to pay taxes. And the result is often a sell-off of assets to large corporations, destroying jobs and investment opportunities. 
   I realize that some people favor the death tax as a means of punishing people who have amassed great quantities of wealth. But the IRS' own records show that fully 80% of all taxable estates are worth less than $1 million. 
   $1 million still sounds like a lot of money, Mr. President. But consider this: according to the Associated General Contractors of America, any contractor who purchases the three pieces of equipment essential to this trade, an off-highway dump truck, bulldozer and front-end loader, will have already amassed assets valued at over $1 million. 
   And relatively new businesses, such as those begun by black Americans until recent years deprived of the chance to compete, are especially vulnerable to the death tax. A Kennesaw State College survey found that close to a third of African American-owned businesses would have to be sold by their inheriting heirs to pay taxes. The death tax destroys family businesses. It destroys wealth, and it destroys jobs. It is time to end it. 
   But entrepreneurs need more help from us. Current tax laws, by subsidizing employer-purchased health plans, penalize small business owners. They make it more difficult for them to afford their own health insurance and to attract and keep good employees without spending themselves into bankruptcy. 
   The substitute framed by Leader Lott would address these barriers to family-owned business survival by accelerating the 100% deductibility of self-employed health insurance. 
   The provisions I have outlined aim to bring substantive tax relief to the mainstream of the American economy. This is crucial to the economic well-being of our nation. 
   But we must do more. We also must bring greater economic opportunity to disadvantaged urban and rural areas throughout the United States. If we are to remain prosperous over the long term, we must bring more Americans into the vast mainstream of our economy by empowering them to take control of their own economic lives. That is why this substitute extends the critical work opportunity credit and welfare-to-work credits through 2004. 
   Finally, we must continue to encourage the research and development so crucial to maintaining our competitive edge in global markets, particularly in this era of high-tech development. That is why this substitute provides for the permanent extension of the R&D tax credit. 
   All told, the provisions making up this substitute will provide $800 billion in tax relief for the American people. This substitute will encourage work, savings and investment, it will help working families, it will help distressed urban and rural areas, and it will provide $2.2 trillion for Social Security, Medicare, and debt reduction. 
   It is my hope that the conference committee on the tax bill will produce an agreement that mirrors the Leader's substitute tax plan. 
   I believe we must look to this era of budget surpluses with confidence. Confidence in ourselves and confidence in the American people. This is no time for business as usual. Rather, we are faced with once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to free Americans from the burden of stifling overtaxation, freeing their energies and their intellects even as we provide a solid grounding of Social Security and Medicare for generations to come. 
   There are voices of doom abroad in the land, Mr President. But these voices are as wrong today as they have always been. They would have us put all of our faith and confidence in an ever-growing federal government, with its ever-growing financial resources diverted by its bureaucratic experts into  programs designed to protect us from ourselves. 
   I say no to these doomsayers. I say ``no'' to them because I believe it is important for us to say ``yes' to the American people. Yes to their dreams of financial security, yes to their desire to pass the family business on to their children, yes to their cries for help relieving the highest tax burden since World War II. 
   It is time to provide the kind of broad-based tax relief in this substitute so that the American economy and the American spirit may grow and prosper. This act of hope will protect our seniors, pay down our debt and constitute an investment in our future that will pay dividends for decades to come.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, first of all, we have endeavored to and have modified our amendment to try to address some of these concerns. I think we have done so. I believe we have given sufficient flexibility so that there will not be the concerns that were raised in that letter. 
   This lockbox does not need a lot of debate. Americans have been hearing us talk about it now for almost 3 months. We will continue to try to get a straight up-down vote on this. I would note that once again this morning another procedural roadblock has been put in place to prevent us from getting a straight up-or-down vote. I regret that. I was prepared to come today and offer both sides the opportunity to have straightforward votes. If one side or the other in their various lockbox proposals got 50-plus votes, they would win and we could give the American people what I believe they want, and that is protection for their Social Security dollars sent to Washington. But again, once more, what we have had is a procedural impediment placed in the way of getting final action on this legislation. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues who have previously supported this lockbox to do so. It is a tougher lockbox that protects Social Security. If we want to do it, I say vote ``yes.'' Vote to waive the Budget Act.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the Henika Public Library on its historic one hundredth anniversary. 
   Recently named a district library, Henika library has served Allegan county since 1899 when Ms. Julia Robinson Henika bequeathed two thousand dollars to the Wayland Ladies Library Association for construction of a library building. At that time there were only 500 volumes of literature, none of which could be checked out. Since then, the library has grown to over 35,000 volumes. 
   In 1916, Fannie Hoyt was hired as the first librarian and, for the first time, books could be checked out of the library. Between 1916 and 1986 only four librarians have managed the Henika Public Library. This stability helps explain the unique environment that has allowed this library to prosper for one hundred years. 
   In the mid 1990's the library underwent a series of renovations. The final result of this remodeling is an historic building, complete with Victorian charm, that can accommodate the most recent information technology. After serving Allegan county for almost the entire 20th century, Henika Public Library is now ready to take on the 21st century. 
   This library is truly one of the great educational tools in our country with a value matched by few others. We owe a great deal of thanks to the women of the Ladies Library Club as well as to all of the people who have worked at this great institution for the last one hundred years. I know I speak for all of Michigan when I commend those who have supported this fine institution for its 100 years of service.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Francis M. Wilson and his wonderful and admirable life. 
   Mr. Wilson served as a tech-sergeant during World War II in Germany when he was only 18 years old. He was a teacher in the Detroit Public School District, a devoted family man, and an active citizen. The challenges he successfully faced in these capacities have distinguished him within his family, his town, his state, and his country. 
   As a very young boy, he sold ``Liberty'' magazines to supplement his family's income during the Great Depression. Growing up during a time of financial strife led him to find solace in nature. Mr. Wilson was exposed to nature during his experience in the military and developed a love and knowledge of it. As a young adult he was able to identify a variety of birds, insects, trees, and flowers. He then went on to form and preside over a group of citizens that forced new construction to adhere to guidelines designed to protect nearby lakes. 
   Once he reached adulthood, Mr. Wilson found his real love, Dolores. Together they found great joy in their children and grandchildren. Mr. Wilson wanted to ensure that they received all the advantages that he did not have. He inspired his children to put themselves through college. He provided them with the opportunity to grow up in a safe environment, allowing them to mature at a more deliberate pace than the one that was forced upon him. His wife, Dolores, expresses the best tribute to Mr. Wilson when she writes ``this brave, honest, dedicated, ordinary man was to his family and America `the staff of life' that fuels generations to come.'' 
   Mr. Wilson expressed his passion for education through his involvement with children as a teacher of thirty  years in the Detroit Public Schools. He gave and received respect from all he knew. He not only led by lecture but, more importantly and effectively, by example. He never left any doubt as to where he stood in a debate and firmly believed in right and wrong. Mr. Wilson offered little patience for individuals passing on responsibility as an excuse for negligent or bad behavior. Personifying Winston Churchill's statement, We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give,'' Mr. Francis M. Wilson left this world an honorable, loyal, selfless servant to his country and a loved and missed father, grandfather and husband.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. I will not use all that time. 
   First, I thank the manager of the bill, Senator ROTH, for his patience and the support tonight in this debate. I thank all the Senators who have spoken on our side, to argue, once again, for the Social Security lockbox. We have been doing this now for almost 3 months. I assure our colleagues will continue to do this as long as we have to. 
   I suspect again tomorrow procedural impediments will be placed in the way of our efforts to try to protect the Social Security surplus, even as everyone in this place makes at least verbal assertions that they want to protect that surplus. 
   But we will keep trying. Whether or not we have 60 votes tomorrow, we are going to continue this battle until it is won. Every single Member of the Senate, I think, hears from their constituents what this Senator hears when I am back in Michigan; an ongoing and ever increasing level of frustration that our seniors, as well as almost anybody who pays money into the Social Security fund, has with the notion that we spend those dollars on anything other than Social Security. 
   We have tried to make this a simple issue from the very beginning. We have tried various forms of this lockbox. We have offered different types of amendments to try to address concerns that have been raised. Each time, procedural roadblocks have been placed in our way. My understanding and expectation is that they will be placed in our way again tomorrow. But the bottom line is that--and I agree with the Senator from Montana--that Republicans do want to cut taxes more than Democrats. There is not much disagreement about that around here. That, I believe, reflects a clear distinction between us. And we Republicans want to protect Social Security with a tough lockbox, the very lockbox that has frequently been criticized tonight because it is so tough. 
   The question is, where is the beef? The answer is in our lockbox. It is so tough that in fact we have been criticized for making it too tough. That is where it is. It is in the teeth we have put in the lockbox. 
   We are going to try again tomorrow. We are going to try tomorrow to pass this lockbox proposal in a form that will absolutely guarantee that Social Security money sent to Washington by people who pay payroll taxes is protected from any spending of any kind. 
   The budget that has been offered by the President is a budget that actually spends over one trillion new dollars of that surplus over the next 10 years. We say those choices, as to how that surplus ought to be spent, should reside in the hands of the people who earned the money and paid the taxes and sent them to Washington. We say take all the Social Security money, protect it in a tough lockbox, and then let's return 25 cents out of every surplus dollar to the men and women in our country who earned those dollars in the first place. 
   As I have tried to indicate tonight, we have endeavored, on six previous occasions, to try to pass this lockbox. In each case procedural impediments have been placed in our way to prevent it from happening. We would just like to have a chance to have an up-or-down vote. If we have 50-plus votes, then we will have a Social Security lockbox. Hopefully we will get that chance.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. I am going take back my time actually, Madam President. I am the only person who has been on the floor tonight who has not spoken. The Senator from Montana had two opportunities to speak. I refrained because we had so many speakers on our side. I would like to summarize. I have a feeling the debate is not over on this topic and we will have other opportunities. 
   I just want to say we brought up the House lockbox on the floor. It was prevented from moving forward. We brought up the tougher version, the Senate version we are offering tonight. We have not had a chance, because of procedural impediments, to vote on it. One proposal I hope might be followed up on is a simple one. Tomorrow maybe neither side should impose procedural impediments, and if one or the other version of this gets a majority of votes in the Senate, then let's move it forward. I suspect that will not happen. I am not going to ask anybody to answer that tonight. But tomorrow I may make a pitch and an appeal to our colleagues to let each side have their vote. If one or the other of these lockboxes gets 51 votes, let's move it forward. Let's give the American people what they want. That is a lockbox to protect Social Security. 
   Madam President, to me that makes sense. To me it certainly is consistent with what voters in our States want, what people who pay payroll taxes want. It is overdue. 
   This Senator will come back, if he has to, time after time, well into the night if we have to, to make this case. But it is a simple one--are we or are we not going to really protect the Social Security dollars, that are sent to Washington, from being spent on anything other than Social Security? I say we should. I think we should use a tough lockbox to make sure that happens. We have a chance tomorrow to vote on these two lockbox proposals. I say, if one of them gets 50 votes, that ought to be good enough, if it is true we all want a lockbox. If it is not true, then we will be back again as we have been over the last 3 months, endeavoring to find a way to finally get the American people that which they want. 
   But, in closing, as we examine this issue, as we consider the next 10 years, if we are really going to have, as current projections indicate, almost $2 trillion in Social Security surpluses, and if we do not do something soon to protect this with a lockbox, those dollars are going to start to be spent. There will be great arguments made for cutting into portions of it this year and the same will happen next year, as has been happening for so many years already. This Senator is doing everything he can to try to make sure those efforts to take money out of the Social Security trust funds for other programs do not happen any longer. 
   All this debate which has gone on for 3 months has done nothing more than delay and keep open the possibility that Social Security money would be spent on other things. I do not believe we should let that happen. I think we should pass a lockbox tomorrow. If somebody gets 50 votes for their proposal, then my recommendation is we should not use any procedural impediments to prevent that proposal from happening. The President says he wants it. Even the House has passed a version, not the one we are offering, but they passed one nonetheless. So let's go forward. If somebody gets 50 percent let's move this issue out of the Senate and on towards final completion. 
   I gather my time is up, and I appreciate the debate that has happened this evening.

   It was with a great sense of sadness that I learned of the death of King Hassan, a statesman, a peacemaker, and a visionary.

He was dedicated to this mission for decades, and it is quite unfortunate that he could not live to see the final outcome of his lengthy efforts.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator FEINGOLD, to introduce the College Scholarship Fraud Prevention Act of 1999. This legislation will prevent unscrupulous businesses from defrauding students seeking to finance a college education. 
   Students in Michigan and across the nation are targeted by corrupt companies preying on their hopes and dreams of a college education. A college diploma is the key that opens the door to many of today's career opportunities, but the reality is that this diploma is becoming more and more expensive to obtain. A number of organizations have sprung up to address this problem, and many of them perform an invaluable  service in providing student financing, or in providing information to students concerning institutions to which those students may apply for financial assistance. Unfortunately, however, a growing number of individuals are turning student need into a scam opportunity, taking financial advantage of students in need of assistance. 
   Each year, individuals and businesses send thousands of letters out to hopeful students, offering bogus scholarships. The tactics used by these con-artists vary, but they nearly always involve misrepresentation and fraud. Some exclusively use the mails to conduct their illegal activities, while others, like the National Scholarship Foundation have sent hundreds of thousands of postcards to potential college students, encouraging them to call an ``800'' number for ``free money''. Students calling the NSF number were told that they were guaranteed $1000 or more in scholarships if they would pay a $189 processing fee, to be refunded if they did not receive the scholarship. Students sending $189 to the NSF received only general information about the college application process and the costs of a college education--information readily available for free from other sources. NSF never provided refunds. 
   The Federal Trade Commission has been aware of this growing problem; and we have sought their input while drafting this legislation. In 1996, the FTC initiated ``Project $cholarship- $cam,'' a nationwide crackdown on fraudulent scholarship search services. But although the FTC is dedicated to stopping these con artists, it can only pursue civil remedies; the Justice Department is responsible for prosecuting these scam-artists criminally upon FTC referral, and unfortunately, such prosecutions are a rare occurrence. 
   Even when the Justice Department does prosecute scholarship scam-artists, the penalties are so light as to provide little deterrent effect. For example, this past May a federal jury in Maryland convicted Christopher Nwaigwe of defrauding more than 50,000 college students of more than $500,000. Mr. Nwaigwe had mailed letters to students announcing scholarship offers of $2,500 to $7,500, in exchange for which students were requested to send Mr. Nwaigwe a $10 processing fee. In reality, after the students sent the check, they waited in vain for a response. 
   Nwaigwe was ordered by the U.S. Postal Service to stop sending misleading letters in 1993, yet, he chose to ignore this warning and continue to defraud students. In 1996, Nwaigwe was the subject of a civil action in U.S. District Court, in which he was permanently enjoined from using materials to solicit money from students. Yet it was only in May--six years after the first official action taken against him--that he finally faced a jury. And the maximum penalty he faces for his long course of fraudulent conduct is five years' imprisonment and a fine of $250,000--half the dollar amount we know to be the minimum 
   he gained through his fraud. 
   Mr. President, the rapid spread of scholarship scams such as Christopher Nwaigwe's makes it imperative that we step up prosecutions and impose tougher sentences. My legislation would encourage the Justice Department of pursue and prosecute more scholarship scam-artists, by providing an additional ten years' imprisonment and additional fines in fraud cases which involve the offering of educational services. 
   In addition, this legislation would improve the FTC's ability to enforce orders for disgorgement and redress to consumers. Senator FEINGOLD and I have been briefed by the FTC on its current problems enforcing judgments, and one particularly offensive example involves an abuse of consumer bankruptcy protections. Often, scholarship scam-artists use their fraudulent gains to buy expensive homes. When hit with disgorgement and redress orders, they file for bankruptcy. And because most states exempt at least a portion of the value of residential property from bankruptcy estates, these con-artists are able to retain their ill-gotten gains in the form of their trophy homes. After the bankruptcy proceeding clears their debts, the scam-artists may then sell their estates, keeping the money they have defrauded from students. 
   Our legislation would prevent con-artists from using their technique to avoid paying court judgments in this fashion. Residential property exemptions from bankruptcy estimates are intended to aid law-abiding people who find themselves in financial difficulty; they were not meant to help scam-artists launder and protect ill-gotten gains. This legislation takes a cue from Congress' response to the savings and loan crisis, and amends the bankruptcy code so that debts derived from college financial assistance fraud would be excluded from homestead bankruptcy exemptions. Legitimate homeowners will still be protected by the bankruptcy laws. But con-artists will no longer be able to use these laws for their own, fraudulent ends. 
   In addition to these punitive and deterrent measurers. Mr. President, this legislation also includes measures to help student and their families obtain financing help from legitimate organizations. We need to make it easier for students and their families to differentiate legitimate companies from con-artists. The FTC currently warns students about fraudulent scholarship services; while this is commendable, however, in my view, the larger number of students who visit the Department of Education web site to find out about financing option makes it the logical choice for an anti-scam public relations initiative. To that end, this legislation would call on the Secretary of Education to maintain a web page on the Department's web site listing legitimate sources of scholarship information. To ensure that this web page is not misused by unscrupulous companies and individuals, and other provision would require the Education Department to consult with the FTC before including any name on its list. 
   No organization would be listed on the web page if it or its operator has been prosecuted by the FTC and convicted of using unfair or deceptive practices. In addition, a business or organization would not be listed if the Department of Education receives a significant number of complaints from students alleging that the business has not in good faith delivered on its promises, or if it is under investigation by the FTC. 
   Taken together, Mr. President, these provision discouraging fraud disseminating information concerning legitimate sources of scholarship information will help students find the assistance they need to finance a college education. Through this legislation we can fight scholarship scams, put those who would defraud students out of business and increase our Nation's pool of educated workers.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. The Senator is correct. Those of us who represent states bordering Canada know well the immense volume of tourism and trade that passes through our states from our neighbor to the North. The implementation of Section 110 would cause gross delays to all those crossing the Northern border from Canada, and ultimately have a disastrous impact on the Northern economy as critical trade and travel routes are slowed. It would also harm states along the Southern border as well.

The border with Canada is the longest continuous open border in the world, and our close friendship should not be clouded by a needless bureaucratic exercise. Moreover, numerous jobs, jobs held by  Americans in Michigan and elsewhere, would be lost if Section 110 is implemented. The effect on tourism and on just-in-time deliveries would inhibit the flow of goods and people in a way that would hurt the economics of many states.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might need. 
   We find ourselves once again on the Senate floor. As I said to the Senator from New Jersey, some years back there was a movie called ``Groundhog Day'' in which the main character in the movie kept waking up each day in the same exact setting in which he found himself the previous day. Somehow that movie's theme seems to be playing itself out in this debate about the lockbox. We are once again to have a cloture vote to simply try to obtain the opportunity to have a vote on the amendment which was offered by myself, along with Senator DOMENICI and Senator ASHCROFT, to the underlying legislation. 
   We have previously tried to accomplish this without success. It is very frustrating because if we obtain cloture today, we would get this vote, but this legislation would then be open to further amendment by any Senator who wished to change its composition. 
   So I start the debate by pointing out to all my colleagues that all we are  asking for is a chance to have a vote on one amendment. 
   Now, this past 4 days we have been debating the Patients' Bill of Rights. I remember back a few weeks ago the entire Senate was virtually shut down so a group of Senators who wanted to have that issue considered could have the entire issue considered and a full range of amendments brought up and voted on, and we did that. Here all we are asking for is a chance to have a vote on one amendment to a broader bill. I hope we will get the chance to do so. 
   The reason for that is very simple. Across my State, and I think across this country, Americans continue to want to see their Social Security dollars protected. They want to make sure every single dollar they send to Washington in their payroll taxes for Social Security is preserved and not spent on other programs or used for tax cuts or for any other purpose but for their Social Security protection. They want to make sure today's beneficiaries are protected. They want to make sure future beneficiaries are protected. So do the advocates of this amendment. It is not just one side that advocates this, as far as I can tell, because just in the last few weeks we have heard from the White House that the President, too, shares our view that we ought to have a Social Security lockbox. 
   It does not seem to me very clear why, as a result of that, we cannot have a vote on this proposal. If others have additions or deletions or counterproposals, they will have their chance because the underlying bill will still be subject to further amendment. But those of us who think this is the right approach want to have a chance to have this approach ultimately debated and be voted on. We have been trying and trying without success. I hope today we can continue down the path we started just a few days ago when we ultimately obtained cloture on the motion to proceed. 
   As I open this debate, I implore Members on both sides of the aisle to give those of us who are advocating this amendment a chance to have a vote on it. If you have your own ideas, bring those, too, and once we have voted on this amendment, we will vote on yours. But let us at least get the ball rolling. If everybody is as strongly for a lockbox as they profess, then let us have a chance to start the debate, and let us start with this amendment which was the first one offered. 
   Mr. President, at this point I yield the floor.

It will still be subject to  amendments that I believe the Senator from New Jersey is referencing. I do not know what those amendment are. They can be brought up if we obtain cloture. All we get is a chance to vote on our amendment. I cannot figure out why we are not being allowed a chance to vote on our amendment. I will continue to make that point today. 
   I yield such time as he may need to the Senator from Pennsylvania.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the ``Veterans' Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act.'' 
   By establishing the National Veterans Business Development Corporation, this bill will provide significant assistance to entrepreneurial veterans. Additionally, this legislation works to aid veterans through networking, supervision, microloans and loans, disaster assistance, and data collection programs. This bill provides assistance to many veterans who have the skills, talent and motivation to successfully own and operate small businesses but may not have the right connections or the ability to hire consultants. This bill is a means by which the federal government can help veterans help themselves. 
   Veterans have fought and sacrificed to protect the United States and the freedoms Americans cherish. Veterans' programs such as this provide us, in a small way, the capability to repay those veterans for their extraordinary contributions to our nation. These veterans have already given so much to our country and many of them want to contribute even more by starting small businesses. I believe we owe it to them to do everything we can to help them in these endeavors. 
   Accordingly, I am proud to join The American Legion, the Disabled Veterans Association, the Reserve Officers Association, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the many other military and veteran service organizations in support of this bill.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Folic Acid Promotion and Birth Defects Prevention Act of 1999. I would also like to thank my colleagues Senator BOND and Senator KOHL for cosponsoring this important piece of legislation. 
   Mr. President, each year over 8,000 infants die from birth defects. The loss of these children, who could have grown up to be community leaders, teachers, doctors, or lawyers, weighs heavily upon our society. In addition, each year over 2,500 babies born live with serious birth defects of the brain and spine, called neural tube defects, and over 50 percent of these cases are preventable. In 1991, research proved that if pregnant women take as little as 400 micrograms of B vitamin folic acid each day, 50 to 70 percent of all cases of these serious birth defects of the brain and spine, such as spina bifida, would be prevented. Unfortunately, this information is not widely known by the public. According to a Gallup Poll conducted for the March of Dimes, only 32 percent of women of childbearing age reported taking a multivitamin with folic acid on a daily basis. 
   We must broaden public awareness about the prevention of these crippling defects. For this reason, I have introduced the Folic Acid Promotion and Birth Defects Prevention Act of 1999. This legislation authorizes $20 million for the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), in partnership with state and local public and private entities, to launch an education and public awareness campaign, conduct research to identify effective strategies for increasing folic acid consumption by women of reproducing age, and evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies. 
   Mr. President, this legislation is an effort to link great advances in research with everyday life. This life-saving information about the consumption of folic acid, which will prolong the health and well-being of women and infants, needs to be broadcast to families and individuals across the country. It is my firm belief that this legislation will be the vehicle to help bring this important message into every home in America. 
   I would like to take a moment to thank the March of Dimes for their involvement in this issue. Their work will be critical in getting this legislation passed and in helping spread the message of the benefits of folic acid. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to address provisions included in this amendment on behalf of Senators ASHCROFT, KYL, and myself. These provisions concern external review of denial of coverage. In my view, they will improve the underlying Republican proposal in several important respects. 
   Mr. President, I believe the Republican proposal takes the steps necessary to ensure that every American has access to high quality medical care. In my view, the overriding goal of this legislation is to empower patients and their physicians. By putting medical considerations first, we will protect patients against arbitrary actions by health care bureaucrats. Republicans have put in place an external review procedure which will guarantee a patient's right to appeal adverse decisions by providers and to receive the care he or she deserves. 
   The purpose of an external review is to ensure that an unbiased, medical opinion can be offered when coverage has been denied on the basis of medical necessity and appropriateness or because a treatment is considered experimental. The changes contained in this amendment will guarantee an unbiased, timely and appropriate decision and I believe they will help ensure that the external review process works effectively. In particular, I would like to focus on three changes which resolve issues that were brought to my attention by the Michigan State Medical Society: 
   First, we clarify that appeals which are considered emergencies be made with the expediency necessary for the emergency, but in no case should the emergency decision take longer than 72 hours. 
   This clarifying language ensures that decisions are made in an expedient fashion, especially in case of emergencies. 
   Second, the amendment language clarifies that the independent, external reviewer shall be a physician in the same specialty area dictated by the case in question. This only makes sense, Mr. President, and I appreciate the sponsors willingness to clarify the language in this regard. 
   Third, in the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus, the independent external reviewer must take into consideration several factors in making his or her final decision. Some of those factors include: Any evidence-based decision making or clinical practice guidelines used by the group health plan or health insurance issuer; timely evidence or information submitted by the plan, issuer, patient or patient's physician; the patient's medical record; and expert consensus and medical literature. 
   This amendment clarifies that expert consensus includes both generally accepted medical practice and recognized best practice. 
   Senators KYL and ASHCROFT have also included other provisions to tighten the external appeal process which I support. I note my full support for these provisions and ask my colleagues to support them as well.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to address the importance of the high-tech industry for working families in America, and in my state in particular, and to set out what I believe should be the high-tech agenda for this body in the coming months. 
   Employment in our high-technology sector is vast and growing. According to the American Electronics Association, about 4,825,000 Americans were employed in the high-tech sector during 1998. That reflects a net increase of 852,000 jobs since 1990. And these jobs pay very well. The average high-tech worker in 1997 made over $53,000 per year--a 19% increase over the levels of 1990. 
   My state of Michigan is playing an important part in the expansion of high-tech industry in America. Ann Arbor has among the largest concentrations of high-technology firms and employees in the nation. The University of Michigan is a leader in this field, and we have integrated cutting edge technology throughout our manufacturing and services sectors. 
   As of 1997, 96,000 Michiganians were employed in high-tech jobs. The total payroll for these Michigan workers reaches $4.5 billion annually, and the average employee makes an impressive $46,761 per year. 
   High-tech is of critical importance to my state. In addition to those who are directly employed in this sector, thousands of others depend on the health of our high-tech industry for their livelihood. Just as an example, 21 percent of Michigan's total exports consist of high-tech goods. Clearly, whether in international trade, automobile manufacturing, mining, financial services, or communications, Michigan's workers depend on a healthy high-tech industry in our state. 
   And the same goes for America, Mr. President. The internet is transforming the way we do business. Electronic or ``E'' commerce between businesses has grown to an estimated $64.8 billion for 1999. 10 million customers shopped for some product using the internet in 1998 alone. International Data Corporation estimates that $31 billion in products will be sold over the Internet in 1999. And 5.3 million households will have access to financial transactions like banking and stock trading by the end of 1999. 
   All this means that our economy, and its ability to provide high paying jobs for American workers, is increasingly wrapped up in high-tech. Indeed, our nation's competitive edge in the global marketplace rests squarely on our expertise in the high-tech sector. We must maintain a healthy high-tech sector if we are to maintain a healthy, growing economy. 
   This is not special pleading for one industry, Mr. President. It is a simple recognition of the fact that computer technology is an integral part of numerous industries important to the workers of this country. That being the case, it is in my view critical that we secure the health and vitality of the high-tech sector through policies that encourage investment and competition. In my view it also is critical that we empower more Americans to take part in the economic improvements made possible by high-tech through proper training and education. 
   Entrepreneurs and workers have made our high-tech sector a success already. That means that Washington's first duty is to do no harm. The federal government must maintain a hands-off policy, refusing to lay extra taxes and regulations on the people creating jobs and wealth through technology. 
   But in one area in particular decisive action is required. We have all heard, Mr. President, about the impending year 2000 or ``Y2K'' computer problem. Because most computers have been programmed to recognize only the last two digits of a given year, for example assuming the number 69 to refer to 1969, the year 2000 will bring with it many potential problems. Computers that have not been re-programmed to register the new century may assume, come next January 1, that we have entered the year 1900. The results may be minor, or they may include computer malfunctions affecting manufacturing, transportation, water supplies and even medical care. 
   Clearly such a result would be in no one's interest. Whether large or small, and whether producers or users of computer systems, all businesses have a stake in making the computer transition to the 21st century as smooth as possible. But, as in so many other areas of our lives, progress in dealing with the Y2K problem is being slowed because companies are afraid that acting at this time will simply expose them to big-budget lawsuits. After all, why get involved in a situation that might expose you to expensive litigation? 
   It was to help prevent these problems that I joined a number of my colleagues to sponsor legislation providing incentives for solving technical issues before failures occur, and by encouraging effective resolution of Y2K problems when they do occur. 
   This legislation, which the administration has finally signed into law, contains several provisions that would encourage parties to avoid litigation in dealing with the Y2K problem. In addition, Mr. President, this legislation contains provisions to prevent unwarranted, profit-seeking lawsuits from exacerbating any Y2K problem, provisions making sure that only real damages are compensated and only truly responsible parties are made defendants in any Y2K lawsuit. 
   Quick action is needed, in my view, to prevent the Y2K problem from becoming a disaster. It is a matter of simple common sense that we establish rational legal rules to encourage cooperation and repair rather than conflict and lawsuits in dealing with Y2K. Indeed, for my part, Mr. President, I have made no secret of my desire to apply common sense rules, encouraging cooperation rather than conflict, to our legal system as a whole. I would view our response to the Y2K problem as really an extension of the idea of common sense legal reform to the high-tech arena. 
   High-technology related commerce, and commerce over the internet in particular, is subject to the same dangers as other forms of commerce. And that means government must make certain that the basic protections needed to make commerce possible are applied to the high-tech sector. In particular, we should keep in mind that commerce is possible only if all parties can be assured that their property will be respected and protected from theft. 
   I have introduced the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act to combat a new form of fraud that is increasing dangers and costs for people doing business on the internet. The culprit is ``cybersquatting,'' a practice whereby individuals reserve internet domain names similar or identical to companies' trademark names. Some of these sites broadcast pornographic images. Others advertise merchandise and services unrelated to the trademarked name. Still others have been purchased solely for the purpose of forcing the trademark owners to purchase them at highly inflated prices. All of them pollute the internet, undermine consumer confidence and dilute the value of valid trademarks. 
   Trademark law is based on the recognition that companies and individuals build a property right in brand names because of the reasonable expectations they raise among consumers. If you order a Compaq or a DEC computer, that should mean that you get a computer made by Compaq or DEC, not one built by a fly-by-night company pirating the name. The same goes for trademarks on the Internet. And if it doesn't, if anyone can just come along and take over a brand name, then commerce will suffer. If anyone who wants to steal your product can do so with impunity, then you won't be in business for long. If anyone who wants to steal company trademarks for use on the internet can do so with impunity, then the internet itself will lose its value as a marketplace and people will stop using it for e-commerce. It's really as simple as that. 
   We must, in my view, extend the basic property rights protections so central to the purpose of government, to the realm of e-commerce. 
   I have argued, Mr. President, that we must extend the basic, structural rules 
   and protections of commerce to the high-tech arena. To be successful this  effort requires recognition of the need for reasoned innovation. If they are to continue fulfilling their vital function of protecting commerce, pre-existing rules must be modified at times to meet the challenges of new technologies. Nowhere is this more true than in the instance of electronic signatures. 
   Secure electronic authentication methods, or electronic signatures,'' can allow organizations to enter into contracts without having to drive across town or fly thousands of miles for personal meetings--or wait for papers to make several trips through the mail. They can allow individuals to positively identify the person with whom they are transacting business and to ensure that shared information has not been tampered with. 
   Electronic signatures are highly controlled and are far more secure than manual signatures. They cannot be forged in the same, relatively easy way as manual signatures. Electronic signatures are verifiable and become invalid if any of the data in the electronic document is altered or deleted. They can make e-commerce the safest as well as the most convenient commerce available. 
   We made great strides in this Congress toward expanding the use of electronic signatures with the Abraham Government Paperwork Elimination Act. That legislation requires federal agencies to make versions of their forms available online and to allow people to submit those forms with electronic signatures instead of handwritten ones. It also set up a process by which commercially developed electronic signatures can be used in submitting forms to the government, and federal documents could be stored electronically. 
   By providing individuals and companies with the option of electronic filing and storage, this legislation will reduce the paperwork burden imposed by government on the American people and the American economy. It also will spur electronic innovation. But more must be done, particularly in the area of electronic signatures, to establish a uniform framework within which innovation can be pursued. 
   More than 40 states have adopted rules governing the use of electronic signatures. But no two states have adopted the same approach. This means that, at present, the greatest barrier to the use of electronic signatures is the lack of a consistent and predictable national framework of rules. Individuals and organizations are not willing to rely on electronic signatures when they cannot be sure that they will be held valid. 
   I have joined with my colleagues, Senators MCCAIN and WYDEN, to author the Millennium Digital Commerce Act. This legislation, which was recently passed out of the Senate Commerce Committee, will ensure that individuals and organizations in different states are held to their agreements and obligations even if their respective states have different rules concerning electronically signed documents. It provides that electronic records produced in executing a digital contract shall not be denied legal effect solely because they were entered into over the Internet or any other computer network. This will provide uniform treatment of electronic signatures in all the states until such time as they enact uniform legislation on their own. 
   Our bill also lets the parties who enter into a contract determine, through that contract, what technologies and business methods they will use to execute it. This will give those involved in the transaction the power to decide for themselves how to allocate liability and fees as well as registration and certification requirements. In essence, this legislation empowers individuals and companies involved in e-commerce to decide for themselves whether and how to use the new technology of electronic signatures. It will encourage further growth in this area by extending the power of the contracting parties to define the terms of their own agreements. 
   And another piece of legislation, the Electronic Securities Transaction Act will remove a specific barrier in the law that is slowing the growth of online commerce in the area of securities trading. As the law now stands, Mr. President, anyone wishing to do business with an online trading company must request or download application materials and physically sign them, then wait for some form of surface mail system to deliver the forms before conducting any trading. Such rules cause unneeded delays and will be eliminated by this legislation. 
   Control over their agreements is crucial to allowing companies and individuals to conduct commerce in and through the means of high-technology. But we must do more to ensure the continued growth of high-tech commerce. Perhaps most important, we must make certain that companies involved in high-tech can find properly trained people to work for them. 
   During the last session of Congress I sponsored the American Competitiveness Act. This legislation, since signed into law, provides for a limited increase in the number of highly skilled foreign-born workers who can come to this country on temporary worker visas. It also provides for scholarships to students who elect to study in areas important for the high-tech industry, including computers, math and science. 
   In my view we should build on the American Competitiveness Act by extending training and educational assistance to the millions of elementary and secondary school children who can and should become the high-tech workers of tomorrow. 
   It is projected that 60 percent of all jobs will require high-tech computer skills by the year 2000. But 32 percent of our public schools have only one classroom with access to the Internet. The Educational Testing Service reports that, on average, in 1997 there was only one multi-media computer for every 24 students in America. That makes the line to use a school computer five times longer than the Education Department says it should be. 
   Not only do our classrooms have too few computers, the few computers they do have are so old and outdated that they cannot run the most basic of today's software programs and cannot even access the Internet. One of the more common computers in our schools today is the Apple IIc, a model so archaic it is now on display at the Smithsonian. 
   The federal government recently attempted to rectify this situation, with little success. The 21st Century Classrooms Act of 1997 allows businesses to take a deduction for donating computer technology, equipment and software. Unfortunately, that deduction was small and businesses had difficulty qualifying for it. Thus the Detwiler Foundation, a leading clearinghouse for computer-to-school donations, reports that they have not witnessed the anticipated increase in donation activity'' since its enactment. 
   I strongly believe that we must change that. That is why I have joined with Senator RON WYDEN (D-Ore.) to offer the New Millennium Classrooms Act. This legislation will increase the amount of computer technology donated to schools, helping our kids prepare for the high-tech jobs of the future. 
   The earlier tax deduction failed to produce donations because it was too narrowly drawn. It allowed only a limited deduction (one half the fair market value of the computer). It also applied this deduction only to computers less than two years old. And only the original user of the computer could donate it to the school. 
   Under the New Millennium Classrooms Act, however, businesses will be able to choose either the old deduction or a tax credit of up to 30 percent of the computer's fair market value, whichever reduces their taxes most. Businesses donating computers to schools located in empowerment zones, enterprise communities and Indian reservations would be eligible for a 50 percent tax credit because they are bringing computers to those who need them most. 
   In addition, the New Millennium Classrooms Act would eliminate the two year age limit. After all, many computers more than two years old today have Pentium-chip technology and can run programs advanced enough to be extremely useful in the classroom. Finally, the new legislation would let companies that lease computers to other users donate those computers once they are handed in. 
   These provisions will expand the availability of useful computers to our schools. They will allow our classrooms to become real places of high-tech learning, preparing our children for the  challenges of the future and providing our economy with the skilled workers we need to keep us prosperous and moving ahead. They are an important part of an overall high-tech agenda that emphasizes expanding opportunities for all Americans. 
   Of course we must do more. We must extend the Research and Development tax credit so important to high-tech innovation. We must extend the 3 year moratorium on any taxing of the internet. We must update our encryption laws so that American companies can compete overseas and provide consumers with state-of-the-art protection for their e-commerce. We must increase high-speed internet access. I will work to support each and every one of these reforms. 
   Mr. President, these are some of the legislative initiatives a number of my colleagues and I are working on to ensure the future of high-tech growth in this country. It is an important agenda because high-tech is an important sector of our economy. I hope members of both houses of Congress and the Administration will recognize the need to support this agenda so that American workers can continue to prosper.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Senator from Vermont. I think I will be finished in that time frame. 
   Mr. President, I would like to speak to the Snowe amendment substantively at this point. 
   As I have a number of times over the past few years, I rise to join her in sponsoring an amendment to address the incidence of breast cancer in this Nation. 
   This year alone, 180,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer. Yet, in this Nation of vast medical resources a number of those women are being denied the best health care available. It is time we did something about it. 
   I have made increasing awareness and funding for breast cancer research a central part of my agenda since coming to the US Senate. 
   That is why I have fully supported the efforts of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, the Race for the Cure, and WeCan. This last organization, which stands for ``We Encourage Cancer Awareness Network,'' brings together people we are interested in cancer control and prevention in Michigan, with a focus on breast and cervical cancer. 
   Awarness is important. Breast cancer survival rates are much higher when the disease is diagnosed early. 
   That is why I have participated in a number of campaigns aimed at encouraging women to have regular mammograms. It also is why I fought the National Cancer Institute's short-lived recommendation against all women in their forties getting mammograms. 
   As I said, awareness is critical. But it is not enough. Research also is desperately needed to fight this deadly disease. That is why I have supported Defense Department research in this area and cosponsored an amendment to the Treasury-General Government appropriations bill in 1997 to authorize creation of a new stamp to fund breast cancer research. 
   Like awareness, research is critical. And like awareness, research is not enough. Women must be empowered to make the best use possible of existing research and technologies in fighting breast cancer. And that means putting health care decisions in the hands of patients and their doctors. 
   The Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act, which my colleague and I are offering as an amendment to the underlying bill, would empower women; it would help them take charge of their own medical care during the time of crisis surrounding a breast cancer diagnosis. 
   Our amendment would require all--and I mean every--group health plan to cover inpatient care following a mastectomy, lumpectomy, or lymph node dissection for the treatment of breast cancer. 
   The length of stay would be determined by the physician, in consultation with the patient, and would be based solely on what is necessary and appropriate for that patient. 
   There would be no minimum stay required, and outpatient treatment would also be covered if the patient and her doctor agree that that is the best course. 
   Under current law, insurers may have guidelines recommending that mastectomies be performed on an outpatient basis. But a mastectomy is, in fact, a complicated surgical procedure, one from which significant complications can arise. 
   Under these circumstances, sending a woman home immediately after a mastectomy may not be the right thing to do. The woman may not have the information she needs, or even the care she needs during this critical time. 
   We must see to it that doctors are not pressured by health plans to release mastectomy patients before it is medically appropriate. 
   Women suffer immense emotional trauma from mastectomies. They also suffer from scarring and may suffer from significant and even dangerous complications hours after surgery. 
   It simply is not appropriate, then, to have anyone other than the patient and her physician deciding when it is safe and proper for her to go home. 
   Our amendment does just that. It allows patients and their physicians to make the critical, life-changing decisions concerning how to treat breast cancer. 
   In addition to these provisions, our amendment would help patients diagnosed with cancers of all kinds by empowering them to seek second opinions. 
   Under the language of this amendment, patients diagnosed with any form of cancer by their primary care physician would be able to get a secondary consultation with a specialist. Group health plans would be required to include coverage for these visits. 
   Even if the specialist finds no cancer, the health plan would be required to cover that visit. And members of HMOs will still be covered if they go outside the HMO for their secondary consultation. 
   These provisions will defend a patient's right to a second opinion in addressing a cancer diagnosis. In a nation with the vast health care resources of our country, there simply is no excuse for not allowing patients to seek an independent second opinion when dealing with a cancer diagnosis. 
   This amendment would place these key health care decisions in the hands of patients and their physicians. It will put the priority back on patient care, where it belongs. It is an important element of our ongoing fight against cancer, and breast cancer in particular. 
   I urge my colleagues to lend their support for this important amendment.  
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Obviously, a number of people have worked in this area of breast cancer treatment. I believe Senator SNOWE, who has been the foremost leader on this in the Senate on working on this issue, will probably comment on this as well. We are attempting to work on getting legislation which she has spearheaded in the Senate into this bill. 
   I have no idea what other Senators may come to this floor with, with regard to other forms of cancer or other types of diseases or other types of treatment. They may well come here with such areas that are specialty areas and offer similar amendments. I would defer to them to do that. This is an area we are working on which we think, in fact, is justified in this respect and which is consistent with last year's amendment on reconstructive surgery.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. In general principle, I believe that these areas in which the Federal Government has not chosen to oversee, where the scope has already been provided to States to address--in my State, very aggressively--that we shouldn't preempt the significant progress that has been made in Michigan. I don't want to come to the floor to wipe out what I consider to be very effective patients' rights laws that my State has passed, which a scope amendment that would cover every single plan in every setting would have done in my State. There may be Members who have States that are in various ways deficient and ineffective. They may want to supersede what they have done.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the newly elected President of the American Osteopathic Association, Dr. Eugene Oliveri. 
   Dr. Oliveri is a prominent leader in the practice of osteopathic medicine. Throughout his career, he has maintained the strongest of commitments to the highest level of medical standards. From his early days as an undergraduate at Brooklyn College in new York, Dr. Oliveri has distinguished himself for his extensive knowledge and tireless support of osteopathy. Dedicated to helping others, Dr. Oliveri took two years off from his personal studies to work in the U.S. Army Medical Corps. Perhaps most importantly, Dr. Oliveri has raised three wonderful children: Gregory, Lisa, and Michelle. 
   Dr. Oliveri serves on numerous professional boards, and is currently practicing at Botsford General Hospital in Farmington Hills, Michigan, as the senior member of the Department of Internal Medicine. He also serves as a director of a fellowship program and chairman of a section of Gastroenterology at Botsford Hospital. Most recently, he has also served as a Vice-Chairman for the American Osteopathic Association. Dr. Oliveri's experience and renowned leadership capabilities make him well suited for this exciting new challenge. 
   Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to congratulate Dr. Oliveri on this tremendous honor. I am confident that the American Osteopathic Association will be well served during his tenure as President.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, within the next several weeks, the Senate will debate an issue of extreme importance to the future of our economy--whether and in what manner to return nearly $800 billion in tax relief to the American people over the next ten years. 
   I strongly support this tax cut. I believe we owe it to the American people, who after all provided the hard work that produced our current surpluses. I also believe that these surpluses provide us with a unique opportunity to reduce and simplify our current onerous, Byzantine tax code. Finally, and most important for my purposes here today, we now have an important opportunity to target and encourage further saving and investment. 
   To keep our economy growing and our budget balanced, we must do more to encourage saving and investment. Therefore, it is my view that part of the tax cut should be crafted following an innovative concept called Individual Development Accounts or IDAs. IDAs are emerging as one of the most promising tools to help low income working families save money, build wealth, and achieve economic independence. This pro-asset building idea is designed to reward the monthly savings of working-poor families who are trying to buy their first home, pay for post-secondary education, or start a small business. The reward or incentive can be provided through the use of tax credits to financial institutions that provide matching contributions to savings deposited by low income people. In this way those savings will accumulate more quickly, building assets and further incentives to save. 
   I believe so strongly in the many benefits that IDAs can provide to low income families that I have cosponsored S. 895, the Savings for Working Families Act written by my colleagues, Senators LIEBERMAN and SANTORUM. Similar to 401(k) plans, IDAs will make it easier for low income families to build the financial assets they need to achieve their economic goals. But availability is not enough. We also must empower the working poor in America to make use of this important economic tool. That is why a second key component of the IDA concept consists of financial education and counseling services to IDA account-holders. These services will allow IDA users to further improve their ability to save and improve their quality of life. 
   Let me briefly outline the four key reasons why I believe the IDA concept is so crucial to a well-crafted tax cut. 
   First, asset building is crucial to the long-term health and well being of low income families. Assets not only provide an economic cushion and enable people to make investments in their futures, they also provide a psychological orientation--toward the future, about one's children, about having a stake in the community--that income alone cannot provide. Put simply, families that fail to save fail to move up the ladder of economic success and well-being. Unfortunately, saving strategies have been ignored in the poverty assistance programs established over the past 35 years. IDAs will fill this critical gap in our social policy. 
   Second, our great Nation needs to address the wealth gap, and bring more people into the financial mainstream. While there has been considerable attention given to the income cap among our citizens, I wonder how many Americans realize that ten percent of the families control two-thirds of our Nation's wealth or that one-half of all American households have less that $1,000 in net financial assets, or that 20 percent of all American households do not have a checking or a savings account? 
   Current Federal tax policy provides more than $300 billion per year in incentives for middle-class and wealthy families to purchase housing, prepare for retirement, and invest in businesses and job creation. Yet, public policies have largely penalized low income people who try to save and build assets and savings incentives in the tax code are beyond their reach. It is time for us to find ways to expand these tax incentives so that they can reach low income families who want to work and save. 
   Third, IDAs are a good national investment, yielding over $5 for every $1 invested. According to the Corporation for Enterprise Development or CFED, the initial investment in IDAs would be multiplied more than five times in the form of new businesses, new jobs, increased earnings, higher tax receipts, and reduced welfare expenditures. And these increases will come from genuinely new asset development. Savings will be produced that could not have been produced by other, more general means, and in areas where there were no savings before. 
   Finally, IDAs have a successful track record we should not ignore. IDAs are working now in our communities and they are having a tremendous effect on families who choose to save for the future. There are already 150 active IDA programs around the country, with at least another 100 in development. Approximately 3,000 people are regularly saving in their IDAs. The CFED has compiled encouraging evidence from their IDA pilot programs showing that poor people, with proper incentives and  support will save regularly and acquire productive assets. There are almost 1,000 families participating in CFEDs privately funded IDA demonstration and as of December 31, 1998 these families saved over $165,000, an amount which leveraged another $343,000 in matching funds. 
   IDAs are already a tremendous success. But, unless additional resources can be found to provide the matching contributions so essential for IDAs to succeed, most low income families will never have the opportunity to save and build assets for the future. The major factor in delaying the creation of IDAs in the 100 communities mentioned above is the lack of a funding source that can provide the needed matching contributions. Our tax cut bill will and should provide nearly $800 billion in tax cuts over the next ten years. I believe that, within this bill, we should make a small investment of only $5-$10 billion in IDAs. This would ensure that millions of working, low income families who want to work and save for their first home, provide a post-secondary education for a child, or start a small business could establish their own IDA accounts. 
   I strongly encourage the Senate Finance Committee to look closely at IDAs as a means of helping low income families build the financial assets they need to achieve the American Dream.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader this morning, I make the following announcement to the Senate: 
   This morning the Senate will debate cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 557 for 1 hour, to be followed by a cloture vote at 10:30 a.m. If cloture is invoked, the leader will file a cloture motion on the pending amendment to S. 557, the Social Security lockbox legislation, and that cloture vote will occur at 10:30 a.m. on Friday, July 16. Following that action, Senator SPECTER will be recognized as if in morning business for up to 30 minutes. 
   The Senate will then resume consideration of the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, with the hope of completing the bill during today's session of the Senate. Under a previous unanimous consent agreement, all amendments must be offered by 11:30 a.m. today. It may also be the intention of the leader to debate and vote on the Y2K conference report and to begin consideration of any other appropriations bills cleared for action. Therefore, Senators can expect votes throughout the day.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may need to make an initial statement. Then we will have speakers on our side and work with the Democratic side to work out the remainder of the time. 
   Today is the 73rd day since we began the process of trying to move forward with a Social Security lockbox. I think, from every indication, we finally will begin to make some progress this morning. I hope this will be a rapid process from this point forward, that things will not be delayed much longer, and we can quickly come to some type of agreement for orderly consideration of this proposal. 
   It is vitally important we not delay any longer. Since we introduced this amendment on April 20, the following has taken place: $22.2 billion more of the Social Security surplus or almost 20 percent of this year's surplus has been put in danger of being raided. The House voted 416 to 12 to pass their own version of a lockbox, a version that we could not consider in this body. The President himself has endorsed the idea of a lockbox and stated that Social Security taxes should be saved for Social Security. Yesterday, the Democratic leader indicated the Democrats would not block this motion to proceed. So I see this as a positive. 
   What I have to say is very simple. It is clear that Americans, regardless of where they might live, believe their Social Security dollars ought to be used for Social Security. I cannot imagine there is a Member of the Senate who does not hear that message when talking to seniors in their States or, for that matter, when talking to anyone who is paying payroll taxes. The American people are frustrated when they hear that money they send here for Social Security is being spent on other programs. To some extent, this was justified during the period in which we were running budget deficits. But today we are not. Today we are running surpluses. The latest news is good news. It seems to me it even further justifies creating a lockbox to make sure none of these Social Security dollars are any longer spent on anything except Social Security. The only way to do it, in my view, is to pass legislation such as S. 557, such as the proposal that will be before us today. 
   So I ask my colleagues to not only give us the chance to move forward on this legislation but to work together to craft a proposal as soon as we possibly can so we can be sure these Social Security dollars do not get spent on other programs. It is a very attractive thing, to talk of new programs, of expanding existing programs, and so on, because today we are in a period of economic prosperity and we are running surpluses. But we should take this opportunity, in my view, to at least fence off the Social Security surplus so it cannot be used for other programs. I am hopeful today we can take an important step toward that end so I can go back to Michigan and tell the people in my State their Social Security payroll tax dollars are going to be protected. That is what I want to do. I suspect that is what a lot of other Members of the Chamber want to do. 
   I am hopeful that after today, once we get through the recess period, we will move expeditiously to finish the job. Social Security dollars ought to be spent on Social Security. We should move as quickly as possible to make that the case. So I am very optimistic, if we are successful with the cloture vote today, we can move in that direction. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute 30 seconds. 
   We are here today to try to put in motion a process that will save the Social Security trust fund surpluses for Social Security. The Republicans have been trying to simply get a vote on our proposal for over 70 days. 
   The entire parliamentary effort that has been described has been aimed at simply getting us a chance to have a vote on what was our original amendment to a different bill. The notion that getting cloture on that amendment would somehow stifle opportunities for others to bring amendments is not the way this system works. I think everybody should understand that. Our goal is to get a vote on the amendment we wanted. That is perfectly consistent with what people on all sides always try to do. It was a simple effort. 
   Let's not get caught up in the parliamentary discussions. The bottom line is we are still trying to create a lockbox for the American people who send payroll taxes to Washington so they can be assured those dollars go to Social Security. That is what we are fighting for. This debate is no more complicated than that. 
   We have heard claims people want a weaker lockbox, a harder lockbox. Let's go forward with it. Let's pass this motion. Let's vote for cloture today. Give Members a chance to have a vote on our plan. If others want to offer their plans, there will be opportunities for that. 
   I don't think there should be any absence of clarity as to what we have been trying to achieve for 73 days, and that is simply to get a vote on a lockbox, which was brought as an amendment by the Republicans. We will still get that vote; we will keep fighting until we do. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I would like to give my support to the Medical Innovation Tax Credit Act,  sponsored by my good friend, Senator JEFFORDS. 
   Our medical schools and teaching hospitals are the backbone for innovation in American medicine. As sites for vital human clinical trials, these medical institutions provide a superior training ground for our nation's health care professionals, functioning as centers for the development of innovative medical technologies, treatments and medicines. 
   Yet, Mr. President, there has been an alarming decline in the utilization of these superior medical facilities for clinical trials. Due to changes within the health care marketplace, our medical facilities have come under increasing cost pressures, driving up the costs associated with conducting clinical trials at these facilities. Currently, it is more expensive for companies to perform clinical trials at teaching hospitals than at commercial research organizations. 
   Mr. President, the Medical Innovation Tax Credit Act is integral to the continued success of our nation's status as a world leader in the development of medical advances. This legislation would enhance the flow of private-sector funds into our non-profit medical institutions by providing incentives for companies to perform more clinical trials at these institutions. The 20 percent medical innovation tax credit would help level the current cost differential and the resulting influx of funds would ease some of the financial pressures our medical institutions are experiencing. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to send a strong message to our nation's medical institutions and health care professionals, that we will continue working to find ways to enhance and strengthen our valuable research program. To this end, it is essential that the Senate support the Medical Innovation Tax Credit Act.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I join today with my colleagues, Senators BOXER and FEINSTEIN to introduce a resolution condemning the acts of arson against the three Jewish synagogues in Sacramento, California. 
   Our history is blessed with courageous acts of men and women who have refused to accept, and united against, ignorance, oppression and discrimination. It was their selflessness which, in large part, secured and protected the same freedoms and liberties so many Americans take for granted today. 
   On June 18th, 1999, in Sacramento, California, the Congregation B'nai Israel, Congregation Beth Shalom and Knesset Israel Torah Center were victims of malicious and cowardly acts of arson. Mr. President, these acts of intolerance and malice are a direct attack against all Americans and the ideals which are integral to a free and democratic society. The very liberties that allow America to prosper are directly undermined by such acts of blatant hatred and intolerance. 
   Mr. President, the United States owes much of its strength and greatness to the special uniqueness and diversity of its people. It is imperative that we unite, upholding our responsibility to honor and protect the basic, inalienable right to live without fear and violence. We must send a message to those individuals who would undermine our free and democratic society, that their acts, and any similar actions, will not be tolerated. 
   Mr. President, I would also like to take this time to commend the residents of Sacramento, and the larger California community, who have joined in solidarity with the Jewish congregations, demonstrating their continued commitment to preserving the freedom of all members of the community.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I lend my support to this amendment. I realize the chairman and ranking member have a number of other issues they want to discuss. I am not sure at what point we will reconvene on this second-degree amendment. 
   I clearly associate myself with the Senator from Kentucky, both as a cosponsor of the amendment as well as with his comments today. I share his view that the appropriate role for the United States at this point is not to decide this matter by taking this action--which I think would be premature; I think there still remain serious issues in play that would argue against changing the status of section 907 at this point. My view is that we should move forward with the balance of this amendment. 
   I, too, applaud the Senator from Kansas, who I think has done great work in this area. I fully support his efforts as well as the contribution he makes by raising the section 907 issue. Hopefully, it puts all of our policymakers in the United States more in focus on the issues. 
   If we are to include the Silk Road Act or a major portion of it in this legislation, it should be included without inclusion of section 907. I am willing to speak on this at a later point if we extend the debate. 
   I appreciate the efforts of the Senator from Kentucky, and I look forward to working with him, as well as the Senator from Kansas, in hopefully resolving this.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I enjoyed listening to this discussion. I spoke earlier on this same amendment and want to speak again. 
   I am a cosponsor with the Senator from Kentucky of the second-degree amendment which was offered earlier today to the amendment of the Senator from Kansas. 
   As many of my colleagues may know, contained within S. 579 is the waiver, which we have been discussing, of section 907 of the Freedom Support Act. Section 907 restricts some forms of U.S. assistance to the Government of Azerbaijan until it takes demonstrable steps to cease all blockades against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. The Azerbaijan blockade has cut off transport of fuel, food, medicine, and other vital goods and commodities to these regions. This in turn has forced the United States to send ongoing emergency lifesaving assistance to Armenia and, more recently, Nagorno-Karabakh as well. 
   The present conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia has been the subject of an ongoing peace process. With the consent of the United States, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, their Minsk Group, as we have heard, has been assigned the responsibility of fashioning a peace proposal satisfactory to the conflicting parties. 
   Despite serious reservations, Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh have accepted the OSCE's recommendations. As the Senator from Maryland just pointed out, Azerbaijan has not. In fact, they have summarily rejected the compromise peace proposal. If Azerbaijan had accepted the compromise plan, cowritten by the United States, direct negotiations would already be underway, and this conflict may have well been on its way to being resolved. 
   If we vote today to abolish section 907, we, in effect, would reward Azerbaijan's rejection of the OSCE compromise peace proposal. We will have undermined what I believe and what I think a number of my colleagues who have already spoken believe to be a primary objective of that proposal, which is ending Azerbaijan's ongoing blockade. 
   The comments of both the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Maryland have been right on point. It could not be more self-evident that if the one and only leverage we have in the peace process to bring an end to this blockade and to the hostile relationships is taken away, there will be no incentives whatsoever. 
   It would be, in my judgment, counterproductive in the extreme to create incentives for the intransigent party to stay the course, to remain intransigent. This, in my judgment, will not bring lasting peace to the region, and I question seriously the conclusion that apparently the administration has reached that somehow this administration, or any other, will be more effective as a negotiator if this changes. 
   There are plenty of countries that have an interest in this region that do not have a provision like section 907 in place. Yet they have been no more successful in influencing Azerbaijan. The Minsk proposal was rejected by Azerbaijan. I do not understand how, in effect, rewarding Azerbaijan for its resistance is going to change anything. 
   I want to comment on another point the Senator from Kansas made. He has mentioned several times today his provision, the Silk Road Act, includes a so-called national security waiver. He indicates that it does not, of course, eliminate the sanctions, it just simply allows the President to exercise the 
   waiver which would remove those sanctions if, in the President's view, the circumstances allowed that. This provision, as the Senator from Maryland just said, would, in effect, give the President the power to repeal section 907 or to maintain it. 
   However, its practical effect would be to eliminate section 907. The administration is on record, and very clearly on record, in supporting the repeal of this principal provision of the law and has been a vocal supporter of the Silk Road bill itself, as the Senator from Kansas just indicated. 
   The notion we are not, in effect, repealing section 907, we are simply putting the President in a position to consider using a national security waiver to repeal it, may be technically true. But as a practical matter, if we act today to eliminate section 907 and replace it with a waiver language that is suggested, we would be eliminating the section 907 sanctions automatically, because I find it hard to believe the President, in light of his statements and his support, would retain section 907. 
   I reiterate to my colleagues the importance of our second-degree amendment. Irrespective of your views on the Silk Road Act, either substantively or, for that matter, as a part of the foreign operations appropriations bill, our amendment would be consistent with our policies in this region, and it would maintain existing law with respect to the Government of Azerbaijan. 
   I hope my colleagues will support Chairman MCCONNELL and myself and others who are supporting this very important amendment. 
   Also, I personally believe the treatment that has been received by the people of Armenia--and this is not the only time in this century that the people of Armenia have been victims of actions by military forces beyond their control--the treatment is simply unacceptable. I am not saying there are not arguments of sympathy toward all parties in this region, but the U.S. Government made the right step when we instituted section 907, that we expressed an appropriate level of sympathy, as well as support, and appropriately so, for the people of Armenia. It would be a tragic mistake for us today to reverse course and to set in motion what, in effect, would be a repeal of section 907. It will send the wrong message to the Azerbaijanis, and I believe just from a human rights point of view, it would send the wrong message with regard to our feelings toward the people of Armenia. 
   Actions such as that would not be evenhanded, but clearly it would be a decisive gesture on behalf of Azerbaijan. In my judgment, when one takes into account the entire historic scope of things, that is not an appropriate action for our country to take. 
   I urge colleagues to support our second-degree amendment, to then vote their conscience with regard to the Silk Road Act, both on substance as well as its inclusion in this legislation. As I indicated earlier, I support the efforts of the Senator from Kansas in virtually all other respects with regard to this effort and with regard to that legislation, except for this provision. 
   Today, on behalf of myself and the others who have joined on the second-  degree amendment, I hope we will have support. Let's not make this dramatic change in American foreign policy in this context. Let's send a message to the people of Azerbaijan that we hope they will take seriously the negotiation of the peace process and that America remains firm in its resolve to not continue or to open up these additional forms of aid until such time as the proposal we have already offered is favorably acted on.

   I say to the Senator from Maryland, I obviously do not know, with respect to each and every one of those issues that was raised by opposition parties, the full story, but I also would suspect that very few of our colleagues know the full story or have examined that aspect of this debate. 
   It seems to me, in the absence of a fuller examination, it would really be a mistake for the Members of the Senate to vote to remove, effectively repeal section 907 unless they know more of the background that the Senator just discussed. 
   I know the Senator from Maryland plans to discuss some of the other issues today, but I urge colleagues who are not on the floor and maybe are not following this as closely to just take note of that list and other similar kinds of lists of concerns that have been raised and very serious charges that have been leveled against the government that we would now, in effect, set in motion a potential plan to support. It seems to me this is the kind of issue that requires far greater scrutiny by the 
   Members of the Senate before we would take that action. 
   I appreciate the Senator from Maryland raising those issues at this time.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue of critical importance to the families in my State. Throughout Michigan, men and women are working hard every day to produce the cars that make our economy and our Nation move. They and their families depend on the jobs produced by our automobile manufacturing industry, just as the rest of us can depend on the cars they produce.  
   But those jobs in Michigan's economy are jeopardized by efforts to increase the standards for Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE. I have come to the floor today because I want to make certain that my colleagues are aware of the extremely serious impact of increased CAFE standards, not just on Michigan but on every State in the Union. I also point out that these punitive measures will be ineffective and fly in the face of ongoing efforts on the part of our automakers to increase fuel economy, efforts that promise to produce fruit in the very near future. 
   The Federal Government currently mandates that auto manufacturers mandate a fuel economy of 27.5 miles per gallon for cars and 20.7 miles per gallon for sports utility vehicles and light trucks. 
   Since 1995, Congress has wisely refused to allow the Federal bureaucracy to unilaterally increase these standards. We have recognized that it is our duty as legislators to make policy in this important area of economic and environmental concern. 
   Now, however, I understand that a number of colleagues are calling for an end to this congressional authority. They are calling on the administration to unilaterally increase CAFE requirements for sports utility vehicles and light trucks to 27.5 miles per gallon. 
   This action is misguided. It will hurt the working families of Michigan. It will undermine American competitiveness. I want to put the Senate on notice that I will use every legislative means at my disposal to see that it does not happen. 
   CAFE requirements costs jobs with few tangible positive affects. It really is that simple. 
   Let me explain what I mean. 
   To meet increased CAFE requirements, SUVs and light trucks would have to be dramatically reengineered. Auto makers would be forced to implement and design radically new engine and autobody changes. Such changes would be enormously challenging, and would be reflected in decreased power and carrying capacity, coupled with an increase in price. The result would be a less desirable automobile. It would spell the doom of the line vehicles which are largely responsible for the resurgence and continued success of American automobile industry. 
   Of course, this is precisely the goal of CAFE advocates: reduced public demand and consumption of this line of vehicle, but it is an unwise course. 
   A government engineered campaign to steer the public away from the sport utility market, one which the U.S. producers dominate, will also be of enormous benefit to overseas competitors. 
   The fact is, the U.S. dominates the light truck market because sky-high gasoline prices in countries such as Japan have forced foreign auto makers to make smaller, lighter cars. 
   This matters because CAFE requirements are averaged over a producers entire fleet of vehicles. Since the Japanese auto producers produce relatively few light truck models, these producers will have to make no changes in vehicle capacity or production in order to meet U.S. CAFE requirements. 
   Thus, foreign producers would avoid the cost and challenge of modifying their fleet fuel economy averages. And that means the government, not the market, will have placed an uneven burden on American workers. 
   Consumers also suffer when their choices are narrowed. And auto makers and their employees suffer when they are forced to make cars the public simply does not want. 
   In a statement before the Consumer Subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee, Dr. Marina Whitman of General Motors notes that in 1982: ``we were forced to close two assembly plants which had been fully converted to produce our new, highly fuel-efficient compact and mid-size cars. The cost of these conversions was $130 million, but the plants were closed because demand for those cars did not develop during a period of sharply declining gasoline prices.'' 
   This story could be repeated for every major American automaker, Mr. President. And the effects on our overall economy have been devastating. 
   During this time of economic prosperity, it is easy for some people to forget the massive dislocation of workers which occurred during the 1970's and 1980's. 
   But we should keep in mind, not only the thousands of jobs in the auto manufacturing industry that were lost during this period, but also the massive impact this downturn in a key industry had on our economy as a whole. 
   The story of plant closings were devastating for domestic automakers back in the 1970s and 1980s. 
   It is unfortunately the case, sometimes when we are in a period of economic prosperity, as we are now, it is easy to forget the massive dislocation of workers which did occur back at that time. 
   We should keep in mind not only the thousands of jobs in the auto manufacturing industry that were lost during that period, but also the massive impact that downturn in a key industry had on our economy. 
   The American auto industry accounts for one in seven U.S. jobs. Steel, transportation, electronics, literally dozens of industries employing thousands upon thousands of Americans depend on the health of our auto industry. 
   If we do again to our auto industry what was done to it during the 1970's and 1980's, we will quickly see our current prosperity turn to an era of significant unemployment, in my judgment. 
   Mr. President, the last thing our economy and our people need is a repeat of those hard times. 
   Our automakers simply cannot afford to pay the fines imposed on them if they fail to reach CAFE standards, or to build cars that Americans will not buy. In either case the real victims are American workers and consumers. 
   Nor should we forget, Mr. President, that American automakers are investing almost $1 billion every year in research to develop more fuel efficient vehicles. 
   Indeed, we do not need to turn to the punitive, disruptive methods of CAFE standards to increase fuel economy for American vehicles. Especially since domestic manufacturers have increased passenger car fuel economy 108 percent and light truck fuel economy almost 60 percent since the mid-1970s. 
   And more progress will soon be realized. Since 1993, the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles has brought together government agencies and the auto industry to conduct joint research--research that is making significant progress and will bridge the gap to real world applications after 2000. 
   By enhancing research cooperation, PNGV will help our auto industry develop vehicles that are more easily recyclable, have lower emissions, and can achieve up to triple the fuel efficiency of today's midsize family sedans. All this while producing cars that retain performance, utility, safety and economy. 
   By next year, Mr. President, technologies developed in the PNGV program will be incorporated into concept vehicles. These vehicles will help the auto industry determine their functional benefits, develop production infrastructure and determine commercial viability. 
   By 2004 we will have production-feasible prototypes that can be brought to mass production within 3-5 years. 
   Direct-injection engines, new forms of fuel cells, lithium batteries, new polymers, and many other technological developments are now in the works. They are in the works thanks to a strategy that places cooperation over punitive government mandates. 
   We have made solid progress, Mr. President. Progress toward making vehicles that achieve greater fuel economy without sacrificing the qualities consumers demand. 
   And we should remember, Mr. President, that we can remain competitive and retain American jobs only if people will actually buy the vehicles our industry produces. 
   Cooperation will produce the results we need. New punitive mandates will produce an economic downside none of us want to see. 
   Again, I will use every legislative means at my disposal as a U.S. Senator to stop bills or amendments to increase CAFE standards. I urge my colleagues to reject this misguided attempt to increase the destructive CAFE requirements. 
   As the son of a man would worked as a UAW member on the line for about 20 years of his life, and the son-in-law of a man who did it for 39 years in the State of Michigan, my family understands, as do thousands of other families in our State, exactly what happens  when people stop buying American-made cars. People in our State and people in other States start to lose their jobs. 
   We don't want that to happen. We can achieve the twin goals of keeping people at work and producing more fuel-efficient vehicles if we continue the course that has been working. The development, the research, the technology, which the Federal Government has participated in is going to produce the success we want. We can do it without government-imposed mandates of people losing their jobs. 
   This Senator plans to fight in every way he can to make sure that is the course we follow. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to thank Senator HELMS and Senator BIDEN for accepting as part of S. 886, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, my amendment to remove the requirement that an automated entry-exit program be established at land and sea ports and replace that with a required feasibility study to be completed within 1 year. This amendment would correct a significant error made in the 1996 Immigration Act that if left uncorrected will cause a significant loss of U.S. jobs in export and tourist industries, and would also significantly harm our relations with Canada and Mexico. 
   This amendment is the same as legislation that passed the Senate in two forms last year, with the sole exception of provisions related to the U.S. Customs Service, which were removed at the request of the Finance Committee because it has scheduled a series of oversight hearings on the Customs Service, which is also up for reauthorization this year, and the removal of authorizations for the INS. Last year, the legislation passed the Senate first by unanimous consent as a stand alone bill (S. 1360) and second, as part of the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill. 
   Section 110 of the 1996 Immigration Act mandated that an automated system be established to record the entry and exit of all aliens as a means to provide more information on individuals who ``over stay'' their visas. However, this well-intentioned government program, if implemented, would be quite disastrous. Today, when INS or Customs officials inspect people at land borders, they examine papers as necessary and make quick determinations, using their discretion on when to inspect further or solicit more information. If every single passenger of every single vehicle was required to provide potentially voluminous information and be entered into a computer--even assuming an incredibly quick 30 seconds per individual--the traffic delays would exceed 20 hours in numerous jurisdictions at both the northern and southern borders. This would create a human, economic, and even environmental nightmare in both directions. Last year, Congress delayed implementation of this program until March 30, 2001. But after that date, the crisis will begin. 
   In 1996, the House version of the omnibus immigration bill contained a measure simply to establish pilot projects to collect entry and departure records at fewer than a handful of airports. The Senate bill contained a general provision to require an automated entry-exit system--but also only at airports. Then, in conference, without any debate, a mandatory entry-exit  system to capture the records of ``every alien'' was added. 
   Representative SMITH and Senator Simpson, to their credit, conceded in a letter to the Canadian Ambassador that it was not the intent of the 1996 Act to cover, for example, Canadians at the northern border. However, because of the term ``every alien,'' the INS has interpreted the law to require this program to be implemented at all land borders, in addition to air and sea ports of entry. To the credit of the INS, it concedes that it cannot implement such a system and the agency questions what it will do if it is forced to do so. 
   The Congress itself never considered such a system. That the legislative proposal was changed fundamentally in conference is clear. As Judiciary Committee Chair ORRIN HATCH has stated, ``I think that we have all come to realize that section 110 of the 1996 Act [was] inserted in conference with little or no record, [and] no consideration or debate. It was well intended, there is no question, but I think poorly constructed.'' 
   I would like to thank Senators KENNEDY, GRAMS, LEAHY, BURNS, MCCAIN, GORTON, CRAIG, MURKOWSKI, MURRAY, JEFFORDS, SNOWE, SMITH of Oregon, DORGAN, LEVIN, MOYNIHAN, SCHUMER, MACK, DURBIN, and HAGEL for cosponsoring this amendment and for their support along the way on this battle to prevent the major disruptions that Section 110 would cause to our economy and our international relations. I would particularly like to express my appreciation for the leadership on this amendment displayed by Senator GRAMS and his staff, who are trying to save jobs for the people of Minnesota that would be lost if this automated entry-exit system came into effect at the northern border. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act on behalf of myself, Senator TORRICELLI, Senator HATCH, and Senator MCCAIN. This legislation will combat a new form of high-tech fraud that is causing confusion and inconvenience for consumers, increasing costs for people doing business on the internet, and posing an enormous threat to a century of pre-Internet American business efforts. The fraud is commonly called ``cybersquatting,'' a practice whereby individuals reserve internet domain names or other identifiers of online locations that are similar or identical to trademarked names. The easiest prey for cybersquatters has turned out to be computer-unsavvy trademark-owners in the non-internet world. Once a ``brick and mortar'' trademark is registered as an on-line identifier or domain name, the ``cybersquatter'' can engage in a variety of nefarious activities--from the relatively-benign parody of a business or individual, to the obscene prank of redirecting an unsuspecting consumer to pornographic content, to the destructive worldwide slander of a centuries-old brand name. For the enterprising cybersquatter, holding out a domain name for extortionate compensation is a tried-and-true business practice, and the net effect of this behavior is to undermine consumer confidence, discourage consumer use of the internet, and destroy the value of brand-names and trademarks of this nation's businesses. 
   Many companies simply pay extortionate prices to cybersquatters in order to rid themselves of a headache with no certain outcome. For example, Gateway recently paid $100,000 to a cybersquatter who had placed pornographic images to the website ``www.gateway20000''. Rather than simply give up, several companies already have instead sought protection from cybersquatters through the legal system. For example, the investment firm Paine Webber was forced to sue an internet Web site, wwwpainewebber.com'' and its creator. The domain name at issue took advantage of a typographical error--the missing ``.'' (dot) between ``www'' and ``painewebber''--in order to direct consumers desiring to do business with Paine Webber to a website containing pornographic images. As with much of the pre-internet law that is applied to this post-internet world, precedent is still developing, and at this point, one cannot predict with certainty which party to a dispute will win, and on what grounds, in the future. 
   Mr. President, some Americans continue to do a thriving, if unethical, business collecting and selling internet addresses containing trademarked names. Whether perpetrated to defraud the public or to extort the trademark owner, squatting on internet addresses using trademarked names is wrong. It must be stopped for the sake of consumers, for the sake of trademark owners and for the sake of the vast, growing electronic commerce that is doing so much to spur economic growth and innovation in this country. 
   Mr. President, the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act will help to establish uniform rules for dealing with this attack on interstate commerce. This legislation would establish penalties for criminal use of a counterfeit trademark as a domain name. Using a company's trademark or its variant as the address of an internet site would constitute criminal use of a counterfeit trademark if the defendant registered the address either knowingly and fraudulently or in bad faith. Among the evidence establishing bad faith would be registry of a domain name with (1) intent to cause confusion or mistake or deception, to dilute the distinctive quality of a famous trademark, or intent to divert consumers from the trademark owner's domain to  one's own; and (2) providing false information on the application to register the identifier, or offering to transfer the registration to a rightful owner for consideration for any thing of value. Bad faith could not be shown where the identifier is the defendant's legal first name or surname or where the defendant used the identifier in legitimate commerce before the earlier of either the first use of the registered trademark or the effective date of its registration. Violation of this prohibition would constitute a Class B misdemeanor for the first offense; subsequent offenses would be classified as Class E felonies. 
   In addition, Mr. President, the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act provides for statutory civil damages in trademark cases of at least $1,000, but not more than $100,000 ($300,000 if the registration or use of the trademark was willful) per trademark per identifier. The plaintiff may elect these damages in lieu of actual damages or profits at any time before final judgment. 
   These provisions will discourage anyone from ``squatting'' on addresses in cyberspace to which they are not entitled. In the process it will protect consumers from fraud, protect the value of countless trademarks, and encourage continued growth in our electronic commerce industry. 
   Mr President, the growth of the Internet has provided businesses and individuals with unprecedented access to a worldwide source of information, commerce, and community. Unfortunately, those bad actors seeking to cause harm to businesses and individuals have seen their opportunities increase as well. In my opinion, on-line extortion in this form is unacceptable and outrageous. Whether it's people extorting companies by registering company names, misdirecting Internet users to inappropriate sites, or otherwise attempting to damage a trademark that a business has spent decades building into a recognizable brand, persons engaging in cybersquatting activity should be held accountable for their actions.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, let me begin debate on this cloture motion today and take up to 10 minutes. I hope I won't need to use all of that, as there are other speakers on our side. 
   We are here now after having, on three occasions, failed to obtain cloture on a Senate bill to try to lock away the Social Security trust fund moneys and prevent them from being spent on other Federal Government expenditures. The Democrats have filibustered the lockbox for 58 days. This is significant, because an additional $304 million of new Social Security surplus funds are added to the trust fund virtually every day. 
   In my judgment, we should be husbanding these surpluses carefully to provide for future Social Security benefits and to make necessary reforms as easily and seamlessly as possible. But because of this filibuster, $17.6 billion of these future Social Security benefits have been placed at risk of being spent on other non-Social Security programs. This is the equivalent of taking away the annual Social Security benefits for 1.6 million American seniors. 
   Mr. President, today we are attempting a new approach having thrice failed to be able to obtain cloture on a Senate amendment to a budget reform act bill. We are today voting on a different version of the lockbox, one that passed the House of Representatives overwhelmingly, and, in my judgment, would therefore seem to be a piece of legislation that we could have overwhelming bipartisan consensus on in the Senate. The question is, Will we do so? 
   All I can say to my colleagues is that in Michigan, seniors surely hope that we will do so--that we will vote cloture, that we will pass the lockbox, and that we will protect their Social Security benefits. 
   Let me introduce you to Gus and Doris Bionchini of Warren, MI. They have been kind enough to come out to Washington this week to help ensure that Social Security lockbox is passed. They have been receiving Social Security for over 10 years and tell me that Social Security is very important to them, as it is to so many Americans, and that they pay most of their bills, especially food and utilities, with their benefits. 
   Gus and Doris tell me that they can't understand why anyone would want to spend their future Social Security benefits on new Government spending, and that they think it is time and imperative Congress pass a law which stipulates that we should not spend a dime of their Social Security dollars on anything other than Social Security. They believe seniors should have a voice. 
   Let me introduce you to someone else, Mr. Joe Wagner, a 70-year-old from Kentwood, MI, a new Social Security recipient, but someone who already finds himself nearly entirely dependent upon his benefits to pay his bills to meet his everyday needs. He said that he strongly supports the original lockbox bill that I introduced with Senators ASHCROFT and DOMENICI and others. He also knows that the President has proposed spending over $30 billion of the Social Security surplus every year. He thinks that is wrong, and I agree with him. 
   Then we have another person for you to meet, Eleanor Happle. Eleanor is a 74-year-old widow who is very active for her age and who enjoys spending time with friends and volunteering at the hospital. She supplements her Social Security benefits by working in an assisted-living facility. I know that she agrees with us that the Social Security surplus should be protected. 
   Finally, here is Vic and Joanne Machuta in front of their home in East Grand Rapids, MI, where they have lived for 20 years. They have been married for 54 years. They have three children. Vic is 73 years old and worked as a police officer for over 35 years. Joanne is also 73 and worked for a bank as well as for Central Michigan University. They have been receiving Social Security for 10 years and believe that the surplus should be used for Social Security as opposed to other Government spending. They also believe that legislation which would make it more difficult for Government to spend their Social Security is a good idea. 
   Now we find ourselves with a new version of the lockbox. It is a looser version, I admit. But we still find the same old foot dragging which we have been suffering through for 58 days. 
   H.R. 1259, the House lockbox legislation, passed the House on May 26 by a vote of 416 to 12--416 for this lockbox proposal in the House, and only 12 against it. But still we are here, of course, to vote on cloture to end broad, uncontrolled debate on 
   this subject. I don't understand that. 
   It seems to me that when the House votes this overwhelmingly clearly this is a version which is a bipartisan consensus, and we should get down to the business of protecting Social Security dollars. 
   That is what at least this Senator thinks. That is what my constituents such as Gus, Doris, Joe, and Eleanor think. 
   I hope today that we will finally have 60 votes for us to consider in a carefully crafted fashion a lockbox proposal that would enjoy bipartisan support. This one certainly does. It did in the House. I believe it will in the Senate. I hope that today we can finally obtain cloture, move forward, and pass this legislation quickly. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will just make one brief statement and then I will yield to the Senator from Wyoming. I do want to remind my colleagues that in the last efforts to secure cloture before the Senate, it was cloture on my amendment to another bill. We just wanted a vote on our Social Security lockbox. If we had gotten that vote, and it had passed, the amendments that are being discussed today would have been in order to be brought. 
   So the notion we had previously denied anybody the opportunity to have any amendments is not accurate. That opportunity would have been presented. All we wanted was a chance to have a vote on this lockbox. That was in the previous effort, on the Senate version. 
   Now we are dealing with a House bill, and it is different in this context, but the impression created that somehow before there would have been no opportunity to present alternatives would not have been the case had we had a chance to vote on our amendment.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will speak briefly. 
   I have to admit to a certain amount of confusion over the arguments about this debate from the other side. When we had what we termed to be a tough lockbox--and we believe it was, the Senate bill--we were told it was too tough. The Secretary of the Treasury sent a letter saying it should be vetoed; it is too tough, puts too many constraints on the Government. 
   Now we are using the House bill, which virtually every Member of both parties in the House voted for, and it is accused of being too easy, too loose, too many loopholes. I have a hard time figuring out what it will take to be a satisfactory lockbox. 
   If you look at the money that comes to the Federal Government and divide it into two categories, you have one category which is the money that goes into Social Security, on which we run a surplus, and all the rest of the money that comes to Washington. It seems to me there is a consensus on all sides that the money that goes into Social Security ought to not be spent on anything except Social Security. It seems to me we could pass that bill, and we could provide the seniors, who I have introduced to us today, with the security that all their Social Security money will be used for Social Security. 
   There is no consensus as to what to do with all the rest of the money that comes to Washington. That is why we have appropriations committees. That is why we have reconciliation bills. That is why we have annual budget debates. 
   It does seem to me a little bit odd, if everybody is in agreement that we ought to keep the Social Security revenues for Social Security, that we can't pass that bill but instead we have to have countless other debates going on about a variety of other spending priorities. Can't we at least agree that the Social Security money that comes for Social Security ought to be spent on Social Security? 
   To me, Mr. President, that is self-evident. All this other discussion increasingly must be an effort to thwart a debate on what to do with the Social Security surplus. To me, that debate ought to be simple. It ought to be used for Social Security. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. If you have any other speakers, we wanted to have the----

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Honorable Ulysses Whittaker Boykin on his appointment as a new judge of the 3rd Judicial Circuit Court of Michigan. On Friday, June 18 he will be invested and begin his official duties. 
   Judge Boykin is very deserving of this appointment. Throughout his career, he has maintained the strongest of commitments to the highest legal standards. From his early days as an associate attorney in some of Michigan's finest law firms to his most recent position as a Partner and Shareholder in the firm of Lewis, White & Clay, Judge Boykin has always distinguished himself and received recognition by his peers for his excellent knowledge of the law and his legal ability. 
   Additionally, Judge Boykin is very involved with his community. From his role with the Detroit Civil Service Commission to his work in mentoring high school and college students, his involvement in these activities and so many more have well prepared him for this appointment. 
   It gives me great pleasure to welcome Judge Boykin to the bench. His reputation as being fair-minded precedes him, and I am confident the 3rd Judicial Circuit Court and the State of Michigan will benefit from his tenure.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and congratulate the Doherty family as they celebrate the 75th Anniversary of the Hotel Doherty on June 5, in Clare, Michigan. 
   The Hotel Doherty was established in 1924 by the late Michigan State Senator A.J. Doherty, Clare's mayor at the time. The Doherty was built to replace the Caulkins House in 1920, with local people donating the money to purchase the land. 
   The Hotel Doherty is one of the last historic landmark hotels in Michigan. What makes it even more unique is that it has remained as a single-family owned and operated business during all 75 years. 
   Clare's downtown business district has remained vibrant with the help of the Hotel Doherty. The Doherty is an excellent example of how small businesses are the backbone of Michigan's economy. I commend the Doherty family on their 75 years of business and I wish them all the best for future generations.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the 54 participants of Girl Scout Troop 327 from Wayne County, Michigan, as they celebrate 25 years of continuous service at the Mackinac Island Scout Camp. 
   Based in Grosse Pointe, the Troop recruits girls from Livonia, Dearborn, and the entire east side of Detroit. This combined group from the Michigan Metro Girl Scout Council will be traveling to Mackinac Island on Thursday, June 24, 1999 to celebrate their 25th Anniversary of service to the Island. 
   While on the Island, the Girl Scouts will continue their commitment to be better citizens through community service and goodwill deeds. In cooperation with the Mackinac Island State Park Commission, they plan to greet visitors in various public buildings, give directions to tourists, paint dilapidated park benches, and clean up heavily traveled park trails. The beauty of the Island will undoubtedly be preserved because of the Girl Scouts' service and dedication. 
   Past experiences have enabled Troop 327 to gain a wealth of information about the world around them. As members of Governor Engler's Honor Guard, the girls have been responsible for raising 26 United States flags over the country's National Cemeteries, Post Cemetery, and another at the Governor's summer residence. Through their experiences, the Girl Scouts have become more mature while gaining valuable life and human relations skills. 
   Earning the ``Gold Award'' and ``Silver Award'' for their active participation in community service, members of the Troop continue to exemplify their self-professed national motto: ``Girl Scouting: where girls grow strong.'' 
   As individuals, communities and businesses strive to make positive impacts on the world, our younger community sets an example for every generation to follow. I urge my colleagues to join me in praising these girls for their continued efforts. The service provided by Girl Scout Troop 327 has left a mark on their lives, and in future weeks their service will positively affect those who visit Mackinac Island from around the world.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer this amendment to authorize the awarding of the Medal of Honor to Alfred Rascon, Mr. Rascon, a Mexican-born immigrant, represents the finest tradition of service to this country. This award, after these many years, will correct an oversight and provide Mr. Rascon with the recognition he has earned. I would like to acknowledge the hard work of Representative LANE EVANS, who I am working with on this issue and who has worked to help correct the oversight that prevented the awarding of the Medal of Honor to Mr. Rascon. 
   To best understand the courage exhibited by Mr. Rascon, I would like to quote an excerpt from the study ``The Military Contributions of Immigrants'' published by Empower America, the American Immigration Law Foundation, the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, Heroes and Heritage, the Japanese American Veterans Association, and Veterans of Foreign Wars of the U.S. The study describes in detail Mr. Rascon's actions on March 16, 1966:  
   Alfred Rascon was born in Chihuahau, Mexico and immigrated to the United States with his parents in the 1950s. He served two tours in Vietnam, one as a medic, and was known as ``Doc.'' When Rascon volunteered for the service he was not a citizen but still a lawful permanent resident. He was 17 years old but tricked his mother into signing his papers so he could enlist. 
   On March 16, 1966, bullets flew and grenades exploded, and Rascon's platoon found itself in a maelstrom of North Vietnamese firepower. When an American machine gunner went down and someone called for a medic, Rascon, 20 at the time, ignored his orders to remain under cover and rushed down the trail amid a hail of enemy gunfire and grenades. To better protect the wounded soldier, Rascon placed his body between the enemy machine gun fire and the soldier. Rascon turned. He was shot in the hip. Although wounded, he managed to drag the soldier off the trail. Rascon soon discovered the man he was dragging was dead. 
   Specialist 4th Class Larry Gibson crawled forward looking for ammunition. The other machine gunner was already dead and Gibson had no ammunition with which to defend the platoon. Rascon grabbed the dead soldier's ammo and gave it to Gibson. Then, amid relentless enemy fire and grenades, Rascon hobbled back up the trail, snared the dead soldier's machine gun and, most importantly, 400 rounds of additional ammunition. 
   The pace quickened and the grenades dropped. One ripped open Rascon's face. It didn't stop him. He saw another grenade drop five feet from a wounded Neil Haffy. He tackled Haffy and absorbed the grenade blast himself, saving Haffy's life. 
   Though severely wounded, Rascon crawled back among the other wounded and gave them aid. A few minutes later, Rascon saw Sergeant Ray Compton being hit by gunfire. As Rascon moved toward him, another hand grenade dropped. Instead of seeking cover Rascon dove on top of the wounded sergeant and again absorbed the blow. That time the explosion smashed through Rascon's helmet and ripped into his scalp. He saved Compton's life. 
   When the firefight ended, Rascon refused aid for himself until the other wounded were evacuated. So bloodied by the conflict was Rascon that when soldiers placed him on the evacuation helicopter, a chaplain saw his condition and gave him last rites. But Alfred Rascon survived. 
   Today, Rascon, now 50, lives in Howard County, Maryland. The soldiers who witnessed Rascon's deeds that day recommended him in writing for a Medal of Honor. Years later, these soldiers were shocked to discover that he had not received one. The men continue to this day to seek full recognition and the awarding of the Medal of Honor for Alfred Rascon. 
   Perhaps the best description of Alfred Rascon's actions came 30 years later from fellow platoon member Larry Gibson: I was a 19-year-old gunner with a recon section. We were under intense and accurate enemy fire that had pinned down the point squad, making it almost impossible to move without being killed. Unhesitatingly, Doc [as he was called] went forward to aid the wounded and dying. I was one of the wounded. Doc took the brunt of several enemy grenades, shielding the wounded with his body ..... In these few words I cannot fully describe the events of that day. The acts of unselfish heroism Doc performed while saving the many wounded, though severely wounded himself, speak for themselves. This country needs genuine heroes. Doc Rascon is one of those.'' 
   Rascon was once asked why he acted with such courage on the battlefield even though he was an immigrant and not yet a citizen. Rascon replied, ``I was always an American in my heart.''  
   Mr. President, the approach of Memorial Day is a proper occasion for us to reflect on what it means to live in a nation that can attract young men and women who were not even born here to volunteer and, if necessary, die for their adopted country. It is an occasion to reflect on what it means to live in a nation where to this day the children of immigrants volunteer and serve. 
   Today, over 60,000 active military personnel are immigrants to his country. This desire to serve is consistent with our history. More than 20 percent of the recipients of our highest military award, the Congressional Medal of Honor, have been immigrants. Indeed America remains free because in no small part she has been blessed with many American heroes willing to give their lives in her defense. 
   During his last year in office, Ronald Reagan traveled out to a high school in Suitland, MD. Surrounded by students he was asked about America and what it means to be an American. President Reagan looked out at the young people and responded:  
   I got a letter from a man the other day, and I'll share it with you. The man said you can go to live in Japan, but you cannot become Japanese--or Germany, or France--and he named all the others. But he said anyone from any corner of the world can come to America and become an American.  
   We owe a debt to all those people, wherever they or their parents were born, who have kept our Nation free and safe in a dangerous world. And we owe a continuing debt of gratitude to those today who serve, guarding our country, our homes and our freedom. Like all good things, freedom must be won again and again. I hope all of us will remember those, immigrants and native born, who have won freedom for us in the past, and stand ready to win freedom for us again, if they must. May we never forget our debt to the brave who have fallen and the brave who stand ready to fight. 
   I believe the awarding of the Medal of Honor to Alfred Rascon is richly deserved. This award will demonstrate America's appreciation of Alfred Rascon's valor in combat and recognize his extraordinary service to this country. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, with Memorial Day soon upon us, I wanted to share with my colleagues some of the testimony from yesterday's Senate Immigration Subcommittee hearing on ``The Contribution of Immigrants to America's Armed Forces.'' It featured some dramatic testimony from both immigrants and native-born individuals. 
   Let me begin by quoting the testimony of Elmer Compton, a native of Indiana who served in Vietnam.  
   When I look at my wife, son and daughter, I cannot keep from thinking of one particular immigrant by the name of Al Rascon and the contribution he made to me and my family on March 16, 1966. The heroic and gallant actions of Al Rascon on that day, I believe saved my life, as well as other members of my team. 
   On March 16, 1966, Al Rascon was with the Recon Platoon on a search and destroy mission known as Operation Silver City. My team had engaged a well-armed enemy force. The enemy force had fire superiority that immediately pinned down the entire point squad with heavy machine gun fire and numerous hand grenades. Through the intense fire of automatic weapons and grenades, Rascon made his way to point where my squad was pinned down and could not move in any direction. Wounded himself, Rascon continued to work his way to my position, attending to wounded as he did. 
   After reaching my position I could see that he was in great pain. He began to patch me up. As I was placing M16 fire in the direction of the enemy, two or three hand grenades were thrown in the direction of Rascon and myself, landing no more than a few feet away. Without hesitation, Rascon jumped on me, taking me to the ground and covering me with his body. He received numerous wounds to his body and face. 
   I truly believe his actions that day saved my life. What more can a person do for God, Country and his fellow man. 
   In closing, I think of the Military Code of Conduct. The First Code, I am an American fighting man, I serve in the forces which guard our Country and our way of life. And  I am prepared to give my life in its defense.' The immigrants I had the privilege to know and serve with upheld this Code. Again, thank you for this opportunity.  
   Erick A. Mogollon, a Guatemalan-born immigrant and Gulf War veteran, is a Senior Chief Petty Officer with the U.S. Navy. At the hearing he summed up the views of many immigrant soldiers and sailors when he testified,  
   After having had the opportunity to meet so many shipmates over the course of my career, I can honestly say that the contribution of immigrant American's can never be fully measured. These Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines, have left their motherland, been welcomed by the United States and have given of themselves to the defense of this nation. For many immigrants, they have given and will continue to give because of their deep appreciation and dedication to the Untied States. They know, first hand, how it is to live without the protection and security they now count on, and will give their lives to protect it.  
   The statement of Paul Bucha, president of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, also included some strong declarations that I believe are worth sharing. Mr. Bucha testified,  
   Tens of thousands of immigrants and hundreds of thousands of the descendants of immigrants have died in combat fighting for America. I put to you that there is a standard, a basic standard, by which to judge whether America is correct to maintain a generous legal immigration policy: Have immigrants and their children and grandchildren been willing to fight and die for the United States of America? The answer--right up to the present day--remains a resounding ``yes.''

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to a Detroit Free Press article, published on Tuesday of this week, entitled, ``Federal gun cases decrease: Decline in Michigan greater than in U.S.'' This article notes that from 1993 to 1997, there has been a very significant decline in the number of gun prosecutions brought in Detroit. 
   Mr. President, over the last two weeks, we in this body engaged in lengthy debate on the question of how effective or useful different proposals to regulate firearms were likely to be in stemming violent crime, most especially juvenile crime. I supported some of the proposals and opposed others. This article, however, brings home another important point raised in this debate: no matter what laws this Congress passes, their effect on violent crime will almost certainly be negligible if the Administration is not willing to use them to prosecute violent criminals. Unfortunately, the Free Press article provides little ground for optimism on this score. 
   According to the Free Press, between 1993 and 1997 the number of people prosecuted in Detroit in cases investigated by the BATF dropped by 55%, compared with a 36% drop nationally. The Free Press also reports that there has been a nearly 50% decrease in prosecutions involving the three largest categories of federal gun laws, from 221 to 112 respectively. 
   When asked about this, U.S. Attorney Saul Green of Detroit reportedly stated that the decrease in prosecutions in the Eastern District of Michigan follows a downward trend in crimes. In fact, however, while there has been some improvement on that score, Detroit's violent crime rate has been falling significantly less than that of most large metropolitan areas, and it remains unacceptably high. Meanwhile, the much more dramatic decline of violent crime in Richmond, Virginia, where federal officials have pursued a policy of vigorous prosecution of gun offenders, strongly suggests that if the Administration were following the same course in Detroit, we would be doing better. 
   As the Detroit Free Press article points out, police records show that there were 559 murders in Detroit in 1993, compared to 453 in 1998. But that still left Detroit with the highest murder rate per capita for cities with a population of approximately one million or more--and the sixth highest among the U.S.'s 225 largest cities. 
   Moreover, while in 1998 the rate of reported violent crimes decreased 6% nationally, in Detroit it actually increased by 13%, according to FBI figures. Nor is this simply a one-year anomaly. 
   In 1997, the number of murders in Detroit increased by 9% from 1996 and Detroit's murder rate ranked 5th worst among the U.S.'s 225 largest cities. Meanwhile, our rate of serious crime decreased by only 1%, compared to a 3.2% decrease nationally. Similarly, in 1996, Detroit's rate of violent crimes decreased by only 3%, compared to a 7% decrease nationally. 
   Nor is Detroit's relatively small numerical improvement explained by the fact that it is a major metropolitan area. To the contrary, it is mostly the biggest cities, like New York, that have seen the largest drops in crime rates over the past few years. 
   The fact that Detroit is lagging behind the nation's improving violent crime rates, along with the fact that it is continually among nation's 5-7 worst cities with respect to its homicide rate, clearly indicates that this is no time for anyone in Detroit, including the federal government, to be relaxing our crime-fighting efforts. Meanwhile, recent data from Richmond, Virginia's Project EXILE strongly suggest that aggressive prosecution and severe punishment of gun law violations would be of major help. In 1998, the year following the implementation of Project Exile in Richmond, the homicide rate in Richmond decreased by approximately 1/3. The rate of firearm-related homicides in Richmond dropped even more--66%, from 122 in 1997 to 78 in 1998. 
   This takes me back to where I started. I voted in favor of several of the measures the Senate adopted last week because I believe that they can be useful tools in stopping gun violence. But quite simply, no gun laws, either those currently on the books or any new ones that Congress may enact, can be effective if the Attorney General does not enforce them through aggressive prosecution. The Detroit Free Press's article of two days ago confirms that right now, both in Detroit and nationally, aggressive prosecution is not what we are seeing. For our children's sake, it is high time for it to begin.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small Business Liability Reform Act of 1999, legislation that will provide targeted relief to small businesses nationwide. 
   Small businesses in Michigan and across this nation are faced with a daily threat of burdensome litigation, a circumstance which has created a desperate need for relief from unwarranted and costly lawsuits. While other sectors of our society and our economy also need relief from litigation excesses, small businesses by their very nature are particularly vulnerable to lawsuit abuse, and find it particularly difficult to bear the high cost of defending themselves against unjustified and unfair litigation. 
   Small businesses represent the engine of our growing economy and provide countless benefits to communities across America. The Research Institute for Small and Emerging Business, for example, has estimated that there are over 20 million small businesses in America, and that these small businesses generate 50 percent of our country's private sector output. 
   My small business constituents relate story after story describing the constraints, limitations and fear posed by the very real threat of abusive and unwarranted litigation. The real world impact translates into high-cost liability insurance, which wastes resources that could instead be used to expand small businesses, to provide more jobs, or to offer more benefits to employees. According to a recent Gallup survey, one out of every five small businesses decides not to hire more employees, expand its business, introduce a new product, or improve an existing product because of the fear of lawsuits--not entrepeneurial risk, not lack of capital resources, but lawsuits. 
   In the same vein, innocent product sellers--often small businesses like your neighborhood corner grocery  store--have also described the high legal costs they incur when they are needlessly drawn into product liability lawsuits. The unfairness in these cases is astonishing--the business may not even produce a product, but is still sued for product defects. The reason? It is no secret that courts differ in how favorably they look upon product liability suits--some are receptive, others outright hostile. So even though a local store neither designs nor manufactures the product, it is routinely dragged into court because the plaintiff's attorney desires to pull manufacturers into a favorable forum. That's called ``forum shopping'' on the part of the plaintiff, and the practice causes needless financial damage to America's small businesses. And while the non-culpable product seller is rarely found liable for damages, it must still bear the enormous cost of defending itself against these unwarranted suits. Rental and leasing companies are in a similarly vulnerable position, as they are commonly held liable for the wrongful conduct of their customers even though the companies themselves are found to have committed no wrong. 
   The 105th Congress passed the Volunteer Protection Act, which provides specific protections from abusive litigation to volunteers. The Senate passed that legislation by an overwhelming margin of 99-1, and the President signed it, making it Public Law 105-19. That legislation provides a model for further targeted reforms for sectors of our economy that are particularly hard hit and in need of immediate relief. I believe it is high time for small business liability reform, time to take this small step, time to shield those not at fault from needless expense and unwarranted distress. 
   Mr. President, I'd like to take a moment and provide a little background on our effort, as I believe it will highlight the desperate need for reform. Small businesses shoulder an often unbearable load from unwarranted and unjustified lawsuits. Data from San Diego's Superior Court published by the Washington Legal Foundation reveals that punitive damages are requested in 41 percent of suits against small businesses. It is simply unfathomable that such a large proportion of our small businesses could be engaging in the sort of egregious misconduct that would warrant a claim of punitive damages. Similarly, the National Federal of Independent Business reports that 34 percent of Texas small business owners are sued or threatened with court action seeking punitive damages; again, the outrageously high rate of prayer for punitive damages simply cannot have anything to do with actual wrongdoing by the defendant. 
   The specifics of the cases are no better. In a case reported by the American Consulting Engineers Council, a drunk driver had an accident after speeding and bypassing detour signs. Eight hours after the crash, the driver still had a blood alcohol level of .09. Nonetheless, the driver sued the engineering firm that designed the road, the contractor, the subcontractor, and the state highway department. Five years later, and after expending exorbitant amounts on legal fees, the defendants settled the case for $35,000. The engineering firm, a small 15 person firm, was swamped with over $200,000 in legal costs--an intolerable amount for a small business to have to pay in defending an unwarranted lawsuit. 
   There are more examples. An Ann Landers column from October, 1995, reported a case in which a minister and his wife sued a guide-dog school for $160,000 after a blind man who was learning to use a seeing-eye dog stepped on the minister's wife's toes in a shopping mall. The guide-dog school, Southeastern Guide Dogs, Inc., which provided the instructor supervising the man, was the only school of its kind in the southeast. It trains seeing-eye dogs at no cost to the visually impaired. The couple filed their lawsuit 13 months after the so-called accident, in which witnesses reported that the woman did not move out of the blind man's way because she wanted to see if the dog would walk around her. 
   The experience of a small business in Michigan, the Michigan Furnace Company, is likewise alarming. The President of that company has reported that every lawsuit in the history of her company has been a nuisance lawsuit. She indicates that if the money the company spends on liability insurance and legal fees were distributed among employees, it would amount to a $10,000 annual raise. That's real money, and that's a real cost coming right out of the pocket of Michigan workers. 
   These costs are stifling our small businesses and the careers of people in their employ. The straightforward provisions of Title I of the Small Business Lawsuit Abuse Protection Act will provide small businesses with relief by discouraging abusive litigation. This section contains two principal reforms. 
   First, the bill limits punitive damages that may be awarded against a small business. In most civil lawsuits against small businesses, punitive damages would be available against the small business only if the claimant proves by clear and convincing evidence that the harm was caused by the small business through at least a conscious, fragrant indifference to the rights and safety of the claimant. Punitive damages would also be limited in amount to the lesser of $250,000 or two times the compensatory damages awarded for the harm. That formulation is exactly the same as that in the small business protection provision that was included in the Product Liability Conference Report passed in the 104th Congress. 
   Second, joint and several liability reforms for small businesses are included under the exact same formulation used in the Volunteer Protection Act passed in the 105th Congress and in the Protection Liability Conference Report passed in the 104th Congress. Joint and several liability would be limited such that a small business would be liable for noneconomic damages only in proportion to the small business's responsibility for causing the harm. If a small business is responsible for 100 percent of an accident, then it will be liable for 100 percent of noneconomic damages. But if it is only 70 percent, 25 percent, 10 percent or any other percent responsible, then the small business will be liable only for a like percentage of noneconomic damages. 
   Small businesses would still be jointly and severally liable for economic damages, and any other defendants in the action that were not small businesses could be held jointly and severally liable for all damages. But the intent of this provision is to provide some protection to small businesses, so that they will not be sought out as ``deep pocket'' defendants by trail lawyers who would otherwise try to get small businesses on the hook for harms that they have not caused. The fact is that many small businesses simply do not have deep pockets, and they frequently need all of their resources just to stay in business, take care of their employees, and make ends meet. 
   Other provisions in this title specify the situations in which its reforms apply. The title defines small business as any business having fewer than 25 employees, the same definition included in the Product Liability Conference Report. Like the Volunteer Protection Act, this title covers all civil lawsuits except those involving certain types of egregious misconduct. The limitations on liability would not apply to any misconduct that constitutes a crime of violence, act of international terrorism, hate crime, sexual offense, civil rights law violation, or natural resource damages, or damages that occurred while the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating alcohol or any drug. Any finally, like the Volunteer Protection Act, this title includes a State opt-out. A State would be able to opt out of these 
   provisions provided that the State enacts a law indicating its election to do so and containing no other provisions. I do not expect that any State will opt-out of these provisions, but I feel it is important to include one out of respect for principles of federalism. 
   Title II of the Act addresses liability reform for non-culpable product sellers, commonly small businesses, who have long sought help in gaining a degree of protection from unwarranted lawsuits. Product sellers, like your corner grocery store, provide a crucial service to all of us by offering a convenient source for a wide assortment of goods. Unfortunately, current law subjects them to harassment and unnecessary litigation; in about twenty-nine states, product sellers are drawn into the overwhelming majority of product liability cases even though they play  no part in the designing and manufacturing process, and are not to blame in any way for the harm. It is pointless to haul a product seller into the litigation when everyone in the system knows that the seller is not at fault. Dragging in the neighborhood convenience store helps no one, not the claimant, not the product seller, and certainly not the consumer. All it does is increase the cost to product sellers of doing business in our neighborhoods, because these businesses are unnecessarily forced to bear the cost of court expenses in their defense. 
   Again, the real-world background presents a compelling case. In one instance, a product seller was dragged into a product liability suit even though the product it sold was shipped directly from the manufacturer to the plaintiff. In the end, the manufacturer--not the product seller--had to pay compensation to the plaintiff. Unfortunately, this was after the product seller has been forced to spend $25,000 in court expenses $25,000 that could have been used to expand the business or to provide higher salaries. 
   Title II would allow a plaintiff to sue a product seller only when the product seller is responsible for the harm or when the plaintiff cannot collect from the manufacturer. This limitation would cover all product liability actions brought in any Federal or State Court. However, we have specifically ensured that the provision does not apply to actions brought for certain commercial losses, and actions brought under a theory of dram-shop or third party liability arising out of the sale of alcoholic products to intoxicated persons or minors. 
   Additionally, rental or leasing companies are often unfairly subjected to lawsuits based on vicarious liability, which holds these companies responsible for acts committed by an individual rentee or lessee. In several states, these companies are subject to liability for the negligent tortious acts of their customers even if the rental company is not negligent and the product is not deffective. This type of fault-ignorant liability is detrimental to the economy because it increases non-culpable companies' costs, costs which are ultimately passed along to the rental customers. 
   Settlements and judgements from vicarious liability claims against auto rental companies cost the industry approximately $100 million annually. In Michigan, for example, a renter lost control of a car and drove off the highway. The care flipped over several times, killing a passenger who was not wearing a seat belt. The car rental company, which was not at fault, nevertheless settled for $1.226 million out of fear of being held vicariously liable for the passenger's death. 
   In another case, four British sailors rented a car from Alamo to drive from Fort Lauderdale to Naples. The driver fell asleep at the wheel, and his car left the road and ended up in a canal. The driver and two passengers were killed, while the fourth passenger was seriously injured. Although the Court found Alamo not to have acted negligently, Alamo was ordered by a jury to pay the plaintiffs $7.7 million solely due to Alamo's ownership of the vehicle. 
   Often even when the injured party and the driver are both at fault, it is the innocent rental company that has to bear the resulting expenses. For example, an individual in a rented auto struck a pedestrian at an intersection in a suburban commercial area on Long Island. The pedestrian, who was intoxicated, was jay-walking on her way from one bar to another. The driver was also intoxicated. The pedestrian unfortunately sustained a traumatic brain injury and was left in a permanent vegetative state. Although the auto rental company was clearly not at fault in this case, the result is predictable: the rental company was forced to settle for $8.5 million out of fear of a much larger jury award. 
   We believe that subjecting product renters and lessors to vicarious liability is not only unfair, but also increases the cost to all consumers. Title II resolves this problem by providing that product renters and lessors shall not be liable for the wrongful acts of another solely by reason of product ownership--product renters and lessors would only be responsible for their own acts. 
   I am pleased to have Senators LIEBERMAN, HATCH, MCCAIN, MCCONNELL, LOTT, BOND, ASHCROFT, COVERDELL. NICKLES, BROWNBACK, GORTON, GRASSLEY, SESSIONS, BURNS, INHOFE, HELMS, ALLARD, HAGEL, MACK, BUNNING, JEFFORDS, DEWINE, CRAIG, HUTCHISON, and ENZI as original cosponsors of the legislation and very much appreciate their support for our small businesses and for meaningful litigation reform. The list of business organizations supporting this bill is also impressive, and includes the following: National Federation of Independent Business, the National Restaurant Association, The National Association of Wholesalers, The National Retail Federation, The American Auto Leasing Association, The American Consulting Engineers Council, The Small Business Legislative Council, National Small Business United, The National Association of Convenience Stores. The American Car Rental Association, The International Mass Retail Association, the Associated Builders and Contractors, and the National Equipment Leasing Association.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to call to the attention of the Senate a letter of endorsement given to my bill, the New Millennium Classrooms Act, by a group of 11 senior executives of Silicon Valley's leading technology and venture capital firms. 
   Mr. President, the New Millennium Classrooms Act, through tax-based incentives, would provide schools and companies the means by which partnerships can be created and computers, software, and related technological equipment can be brought to our schools. 
   Encouraging private investment and involvement, the New Millennium Classrooms Act achieves this important goal without unduly increasing Federal Government expenditures, creating yet another federal program or department and will keep control where it belongs--with the teachers, the parents, and the students. 
   Providing today's children with high technological equipment and software will provide them with the necessary and invaluable computer skills needed to ensure their future success and our nation's status as the technological and economic leader in the New Economy.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to join the Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator PETE DOMENICI, in recognizing Mr. Austin Smythe's service to the United States Senate. At the end of this week, Austin will join the private sector after 15 years as a key staff member of the Senate Budget Committee. 
   As a member of the Senate Budget Committee over the past 5 years, my staff and I have had the pleasure of working with Austin on a variety of budget-related issues. He has been extremely helpful to this Senator, offering his invaluable advice and expertise in the drafting of several bills and amendments that I have sponsored or cosponsored, most recently the Mandates Information Act and the Social Security Preservation and Debt Reduction Act. As Senator DOMENICI said in his statement, Austin is ``a Senator's dream staffer''--extremely knowledgeable, hard-working, dedicated, and able to distill complex topics in terms even Senators can understand. 
   We will miss Austin Smythe's contribution to the U.S. Senate and to the Nation and wish him success in his new endeavors.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the wartime heroism and distinguished military service of Commander David H. McClintock and Captain Bladen D. Claggett, retired officers of the United States Navy. Few men have exhibited the degree of bravery shown by these two men during the Second World War. While fighting for the U.S. Navy, these men took part in the greatest naval battle of all time, Leyte Gulf. Their actions at this, the most substantial attack of the Pacific War, severely limited the Japanese fleet at Leyte Gulf and eventually led to a Japanese retreat from the area. 
   In October of 1944, Commander David H. McClintock of the U.S.S. Darter discovered the Japanese main fleet and fired the first shots of the Battle for Leyte Gulf sinking the Japanese Flagship Atago, and crippling the Japanese heavy cruiser Takao. Captain Bladen D. Claggett of the U.S.S. Dace was also involved in the battle engaging and sinking the Japanese heavy Cruiser Maya. In attempting to close on the crippled cruiser, the Darter ran aground. The Darter's entire crew was rescued by the Dace, which ran the risk of grounding herself during the rescue. 
   The actions of these two brave men and their crews will be remembered forever, not only because of the heroics involved, but because they played a major role in preventing a disastrous defeat of the landing force at Leyte Gulf. 
   Today, I salute the captains and crews of the U.S.S. Darter and U.S.S. Dace. I commend Captain David H. McClintock and Captain Bladen D. Claggett for their distinguished careers and contributions to the United States of America. I extend my sincerest congratulations to Captain David H. McClintock and Captain Bladen D. Claggett, who will be present at a ground-breaking ceremony May 29th, 1999, to establish an exhibit to the Marquette Maritime Museum commemorating their most heroic deeds.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I suspect I will not use all of the time that I have been allotted, but I do want to speak here today in opposition to the amendment before us offered by the Senator from Texas. 
   Especially in light of the grave concerns that all of us share about the readiness of our Armed Forces and the significant steps that Congress took in the supplemental appropriations bill to address this problem, as well as in the budget which we passed earlier this year, I strongly believe that section 806 of the defense reauthorization bill should be retained. 
   This is not because I think that having Federal prisoners working is not important. To the contrary, I think it is very important. I firmly believe that the development through work, self-discipline and other virtues that enable people to lead productive lives is probably the single greatest hope for rehabilitation in a prison setting. Indeed, it is disappointing that, according to the May 20 Wall Street Journal, only 17 percent of Federal prisoners work under the current Federal Prison Industries program. 
   But providing for national defense is the Federal Government's paramount responsibility. Given the very serious problems we are facing with respect to our military readiness, we need to take every possible step to rectify these problems as quickly and as effectively as possible. 
   There is no question in my mind that the requirement that the Department of Defense contract with FPI for certain products, and giving FPI a veto over the Defense Department's going elsewhere, is an obstacle to our efforts to fix these problems. The routine, significant failure by FPI to provide goods that the Defense Department has contracted for on a timely basis--almost half of the time in 1995, and over a third of the time in 1996--is simply unacceptable. To have the Defense Department depend on FPI for over 300 different products under these circumstances is also simply unacceptable. 
   Finally, in this era of tight budgets, to be spending precious defense resources on FPI goods that we could be obtaining at lower prices from the private sector is also unacceptable. 
   We should obviously address these problems by allowing the Department of Defense to go elsewhere and to do so without getting advance permission from FPI. I am glad the Armed Services Committee, at the prompting of my colleague, the senior Senator from Michigan, Senator LEVIN, has so provided in the reauthorization bill that recently passed out of committee. 
   I would add that the provision adopted by the Armed Services Committee still requires the Department of Defense to give FPI the opportunity to compete for contracts for almost all products and only permits the Department of Defense to go elsewhere if it determines that the product being offered by FPI is not comparable in price, quality, and time of delivery to products available from the private sector. 
   The only exceptions are for national security systems, products integral to or embedded in a product not available from FPI, or products that cost less than $2,500. In those instances, under section 806, the Department of Defense does not have to seek a bid from FPI, but in all other instances DOD would continue to be required to do so. 
   It will be argued that we cannot follow this course without jeopardizing another important Federal policy, that of putting Federal inmates to work. But if that were really our only option, we would be facing a much harder choice, since we would arguably be having to choose between pursuing a course critical to securing tranquility abroad and a course important to securing domestic tranquility. I do not believe we are really faced with that dilemma. 
   Rather, I am convinced that the limits this legislation imposes on the FPI monopoly can plainly be offset by expanding other opportunities for prisoners to work. This could be done, for example, by having the FPI focus on products that we do not produce domestically and that we are now importing from abroad. Or it could be done by putting prisoners to work on functions that are currently being assigned to government entities such as recycling. 
   It will be argued that we should come up with the new opportunities first and then consider proposals along the lines of section 806 if the other options prove workable. I disagree. I believe we should put the needs of our national defense ahead of the needs of prisoners. I have no real question that if we do so,  we will discover that in fact we are able to devise policies that adequately address both sets of needs. 
   I will just close by restating what I said last year in a similar debate. None of us who are advocating a change in policy here are advocating the elimination of work requirements for Federal prisoners. But when Federal prisoners in the work they do are taking jobs away from law-abiding Americans who have never committed a crime, then I think we have to reexamine our policy. 
   To me, it makes sense to devise a prison work policy that does not injure law-abiding citizens. I believe that requiring the FPI to be competitive in its bidding process and not granting it a monopoly are the right way to achieve this end. That way the taxpayers are protected from paying excessively for furniture or other items that are produced by the Prison Industries, and those individuals working in the private sector in competition with the Prison Industries have a legitimate opportunity to secure government contracts. To me, that is the American way, the competitive process. 
   To me, if the Federal Prison Industries can't be competitive in that setting, where it has so much of a subsidy advantage to begin with, then it seems to me that the system isn't working the way it should be. 
   I hope that we will vote to retain in place section 806 and that, at least in the specific context of the Department of Defense, we will follow the lead that has already been laid out by Senator LEVIN in the authorization bill as it comes to the floor. 
   To me, that is a sensible course for us to pursue. It strikes the right balance. It by no means eliminates the work requirement for prisoners, but it does provide people who are law-abiding citizens, companies that are law-abiding companies, a chance to do business with the government in a very vital and sensitive area, specifically that of national security. To me, that is a sensible middle ground. Therefore, I hope that our colleagues will vote in opposition to this amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the late Irene Auberlin, the ``Mother Teresa'' of Detroit. 
   Mrs. Auberlin is the founder of World Medical Relief (WMR), an organization which, to date, has distributed more than $500 million worth of medical goods both in Detroit area, where she lived, and abroad. 
   Mrs. Auberlin was a quiet home-maker until she saw a television program about orphans in Korea in 1953. She provided supplies to the nuns who ran the orphanage, thus beginning over 46 years of service to the poor. Since then, WMR has sent food, medical equipment, and supplies throughout the United States and to over 120 countries. In 1966, WMR began a monthly prescription program that still exists today, providing medicine to elderly poor in the Detroit area. 
   Mrs. Auberlin received over 60 awards and commendations, including The President's Volunteer Action Award and Silver Medal, presented to her by President Reagan. 
   On behalf of the residents of Michigan, the United States, and elsewhere, I want to thank Irene for all that she did to help those in need.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am pleased that my amendment to the pending Juvenile Justice bill was included in a package of amendments cleared by the managers. I would like to talk briefly about why this provision is crucial to combatting school violence. 
   As I am sure many of my colleagues are aware, the Holland Woods Middle School in Port Huron, Michigan, made national news this past week. Four children, the youngest of them 12 years old, were arrested for plotting to do ``something worse'' than the tragedy that occurred in Littleton, Colorado. Police in Port Huron believe that the plot was more than a prank. They believe the students planned to rob a gun store for the weapons needed to carry out their plan. 
   Here we have yet another sign, Mr. President, of the epidemic in this country of violence and fear in our schools. 
   All across the country, schools are experiencing bomb threats and students and teachers are beginning to fear entering the classroom. The Detroit News front page headline from yesterday summed it up: ``Fear, threats invade Metro classrooms.'' The News went on to report that one-third of the 560 students at Holland Woods Middle School stayed home Monday, the first day of classes since police discovered the plot to massacre students there. 
   Mr. President, students should not fear for their lives when they enter the school building. Indeed, they have a right not to be put in this kind of fear, particularly on school grounds. 
   I believe we must do more to help schools deal with threats of violence. We must give schools more options to prevent the type of tragedy that occurred in Littleton and that also might have occurred in Port Huron. 
   Following the incident in Holland Woods Middle School, Assistant Superintendent Thomas Miller outlined the school system's response to increasing security at their schools. The school system's plan would include 24-hour security guard surveillance at all schools and a bomb-sniffing dog. Other proposed security measures could include metal detectors, the elimination of coats in classrooms and photo identification badges for pupils and teachers. 
   Mr. President, my provision would allow schools facing these serious security problems to access Safe and Drug Free School money to address their security needs and to truly keep their schools ``safe.'' 
   In light of the growing number of violence in our schools and an increase in the number of threats, we must provide local school districts with further, effective options in combatting the proliferation of guns, explosives, and other weapons in our schools. 
   My provision will also help schools deal with the scourge of drugs, a scourge which not only ruins individual lives but also breeds the kinds of isolation, maladjustment and violence we have seen so often in recent years. 
   Currently, school districts may use funds allocated under the Safe and Drug Free Schools Act for a variety of programs aimed at reducing drug use and school violence. School districts need additional options. My amendment would allow local school districts to access funding under the Safe and Drug Free Schools Act for use in conducting locker searches for guns, explosives, other weapons, or drugs and for the drug testing of students. 
   Drug use constitutes a full-fledged epidemic in our schools, Mr. President. In a recent Luntz survey, three fourths of high school students said that their schools are not drug free. 41 percent reported seeing drugs sold on school grounds. And now the drug menace is moving into our middle schools. 46 percent, almost half of our middle school kids, go to schools that are not drug free. 
   With the explosion in drug use we also have seen a massive proliferation of guns in our schools. The Departments of Education and Justice report that 6,093 students were expelled for bringing guns to school during the 1996-97 school year alone. 
   This is the situation supposedly addressed by the Safe and Drug Free Schools Act. So, what is this act, written into law in 1986 and with current funding levels at $566 million, accomplishing? Tragically little, Mr. President. 
   Congress passed the Safe and Drug Free School Act allocating funds to fight drug use and the violence it breeds. But that money is not being spent wisely, on programs that actually succeed in reducing drug use and gun violence in our schools. 
   Instead, Mr. President, a report in the Los Angeles Times has found that grant money is being used to pay for questionable activities like motivational speakers, puppet shows, tickets to Disneyland, dunking booths and magic shows. Surely we can use this law for something more than what President Clinton's own drug Czar, General Barry McCaffrey, calls a program to ``mail out checks.'' 
   Our children and their teachers deserve better. Indeed, Mr. President, they are demanding better. For three years running, teens in the Luntz survey have deemed drugs the most important problem they face. Most teens favor random locker searches and drug testing of all students. 
   And their teachers agree. Four out of five teachers favor locker searches and a zero tolerance policy on drugs. Two thirds favor at least some form of drug testing. 
   Mr. President, our teachers and our children have recognized the obvious: we must find those who are bringing guns and explosives into our schools if we are to stop gun and other forms of violence affecting our kids 
   By the same token, Mr. President, you must find those who are using and dealing drugs before you can effectively deal with the drug problem in our schools. 
   My amendment accepts the common sense logic expressed by our teachers and students. 
   My amendment does nothing to alter the availability of funds for other options in the fight against drugs and gun violence in our schools. It merely adds to the list the option of using these funds for locker searches and drug testing. It, rightly in my view, leaves the final decision on these issues to those who know the needs of their schools best--local authorities. But it adds an important option to the list from which they can choose. 
   I am pleased that this common sense proposal has been cleared by the managers.  
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mrs. Gloria ``Pat'' Huth upon her retirement which will be celebrated on May 18, 1999. 
   Gloria ``Pat'' Huth was born on St. Patrick's Day to Mary and Martin Halasz. Mr. and Mrs. Halasz immigrated to the United States from Hungary. 
   Pat Huth graduated from Bad Axe High School, and earned her Bachelor of Arts degree from Michigan State University. In 1962, she married her husband, Robert, Sr. She began teaching with the Van Dyke school system, taking time off from full-time teaching to raise her sons, Robert, Jr. and Jeff. Mrs. Huth always believed in the value of education and stressed that point to her students and her sons; her sons obtained Juris Doctor and Doctor of Medicine degrees, respectively. 
   After her boys began attending elementary school, Pat Huth returned to full-time teaching. In 1971, she began teaching at Neil E. Reid school in the L'Anse Creuse School District. In 1974, she was among eight teachers that left Neil E. Reid with their principal, Joseph Carkenord to open the new elementary school, Tenniswood, in Clinton Township, Michigan. Along the way, Pat obtained her Masters of Education Degree from Eastern Michigan University. 
   In 1979, she received an Educational Specialist Degree (EDS) from Oakland University. She was always continuing to attend school so that she could stay on top of trends and issues to help her students. 
   Mrs. Huth taught second grade for the L'Anse Creuse schools for 29 years and was a full-time teacher in Michigan for 33 years. Additionally, 8 years were spent as a substitute teacher for different school districts in Macomb County. 
   Among Pat's interests are serving in the Philanthropic Educational Organization (PEO). She has been a member of St. Louis Parish since 1973. Now Pat Huth considers among her hobbies enjoying three (and soon to be four) grandchildren and stressing the value of education for all those that are fortunate enough to have contact with her. 
   I want to express my congratulations to Pat Huth upon her retirement. Most importantly, I would like to thank her for her years of commitment to the education of children. Pat, you truly are an example for others to follow.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise in recognition of Teacher Appreciation Week. During this week we have a special opportunity to thank the dedicated professionals who open our children's eyes to the world of discovery and learning, the world that will open the door to a brighter future for them and for all of Michigan. 
   Five days a week, for nine months out of every year, America's 2.7 million teachers help to mold our children's future, the future of Michigan, and the future of America. Across Michigan and across the United States, tomorrow's business leaders, inventors, doctors, and even teachers are building the  foundation of learning and experience that will shape their lives and careers. 
   This week, Mr. President, Michiganites like all Americans are taking time to pay tribute to our teachers, some of the most important people in our children's lives. After parents and families, teachers pay the most important role in helping our children reach their potential. No teacher can take the place of loving and attentive families, but the school experience plays a crucial role in shaping our children's character. 
   After the tragic events in Colorado, I hope all of us will take the time to think about the difficult job our teachers have, in these troubled times, giving children the structure and habits as well as the knowledge they need to become good citizens and productive adults. 
   I have always supported calls for better computer technology in our classrooms. And it is true that our children need to learn to use tools that will expand their access to information. But a qualified, highly trained teacher remains the most important education tool in any classroom. Today's technological innovations can help teachers capture our children's attention and bring the world to their eyes and fingertips. But no machine can take the place of a dedicated teacher who genuinely cares about a child's future. With the rapid advance of education technology, we must ensure that our teachers are trained in the most effective educational use of this technology, and that none of us are distracted from the basics of a good education by glittering machines. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. President, there are disturbing statistics about how well our teachers are prepared to enter the classroom. More than 25 percent of new teachers nationwide enter school without adequate teaching skills or without training in their subject according to the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future. One in seven teachers has not fully met State standards. 
   We must do more to ensure that our teachers are fully prepared to meet the increasing challenges of their profession. We must take advantage of every opportunity to provide today's teachers with access to proven training programs while simultaneously recruiting and training qualified and dedicated young people to become tomorrow's great educators. 
   Most importantly, Mr. President, we must applaud and show our appreciation to the teachers who go that extra mile for our kids, capturing their attention, helping them gain the knowledge and skills they need, and providing examples of dedication and skill that should inspire us all.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise this morning to recognize the contribution of charter schools to the education of our nation's children. Today, on Charter Schools Day, we celebrate the hard labor and accomplishments of charter school teachers, parents, and students. 
   In 1993, Michigan became the ninth state to grant citizens the freedom to establish charter schools. Many public school educators had found that the complex labyrinth of federal and state regulations prevented them from providing their students the best education possible. The Michigan State Legislature passed charter school legislation to provide regulatory relief for educators, ensure school accountability, and encourage educators to innovate. The following year, Congress established the public Charter Schools program which authorized $15 million for the Department of Education to support the development, initial implementation, and evaluation of charter schools. During the 105th Congress, I voted for the Charter School Expansion Act of 1998 which increased federal charter school funding to $100 million. 
   Mr. President, charter schools are integral to our nation's education system because they empower citizens to develop schools which meet the needs of their local communities. One fine example of charter school innovation may be found in Michigan's Saginaw County. Four year ago, the Saginaw County Intermediate School District opened their Transitional Academy. This school was designed to educate juvenile offenders and provide them with an individualized education that would allow them to return to their regular schools and graduate with their classmates. Today, I am pleased to report that the Saginaw County Transitional Academy has not only graduated a majority of their students, but that these students have remained crime free. 
   Charter schools are also successful because they empower parents to send their children to the public school of their choice. Last year, Michigan parents sent 30,000 children to charter schools, an increase from 21,000 in 1997. Throughout the nation, charter school organizations report that most, if not all, schools have large waiting lists.  These lists symbolize the healthy competition that charter schools have created within the public school system. 
   However, a charter school's primary mission is to educate its students. Standardized testing has revealed that a charter school education has a dramatic impact on its students. All public schools in Michigan, including charter schools, administer the Michigan Education Assessment Program test. Between 1997 and 1998, Michigan charter schools exam results kept pace or surpassed those of traditional public schools. In fact, half of all charter schools in 1998 doubled or tripled the number of students receiving satisfactory scores in one or more subjects. These results indicate that charter schools are truly improving education. 
   In closing, I wish to honor charter school students, who work day after day to develop their skills and gifts. These students are the future of our nation and contribute to the vibrant life found throughout the countryside and cities of America. I applaud them for their efforts and congratulate them on this important day, Charter Schools Day.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, just to remind our colleagues, as well as those who watch our deliberations, what we are trying to do with this amendment is to amend the budget process in such a fashion that we protect the surpluses that will be built up over the next 10 years in the Social Security trust fund. We have now entered an era in which we project very substantial surpluses coming into the Federal Government, not just as a result of  Social Security trust fund payments but also in the rest of the budget as well. We do not need to use Social Security trust funds to balance the budget. We are at the point now where we can accomplish that without any Social Security money being used. 
   That, combined with the fact we are facing a huge long-term unfunded obligation problem in the Social Security trust fund, in my judgment, absolutely requires us at this time to protect those Social Security trust fund dollars so they can be used to modernize Social Security. The purpose of this amendment is to try to accomplish that. 
   In short, this amendment says that until we come up with a plan to modernize Social Security, the Social Security trust fund surpluses should be used to pay down the publicly held debt. 
   I do not think this is a very complicated proposal. I think it is one that people on both sides of the aisle were applauding just a few months ago when it was talked about by the President in the State of the Union Address, and yet now we hear one after another argument as to why we should not do this. The arguments range from those of some colleagues who say, well, let's just take all the Social Security trust fund surplus and, instead of paying down the national debt, put it in Fort Knox or some other place where it is secure--I can't quite even figure out how that one would work--to others who say this is not the right kind of lockbox; instead of just protecting the Social Security trust fund surplus, we should also save money for fixing Medicare. 
   Well, their argument seems to be that if we don't somehow address Medicare simultaneously, we should spend the Social Security trust fund surplus. That one I can't figure out, either. Then we have heard, from the Secretary of Treasury, various concerns raised about the process by which this amendment would work. We have offered to try to address those concerns. We attempt to do that. We address that in this amendment, responding to his initial letter. Then we heard additional concerns in a second letter. Yet, we have heard no proposal from either the White House or the Treasury as to how to put together a lockbox that would satisfy them. 
   Based on the vote last week, and what I expect to be the vote today, I think we are hearing an awful lot of protests, but I am increasingly questioning whether or not people are really sincere about truly trying to save this trust fund surplus. 
   So for those reasons we are going to keep pushing this issue. We are going to keep bringing this back to the floor. We believe the money people send in for Social Security which creates a surplus ought to be saved to either modernize Social Security or used to pay down the debt and not spent on more programs here in Washington. The people pay in the money. They deserve to have it for their own retirement. We are going to keep working very hard to make sure they do. 
   At this point, Mr. President, I will yield back any remaining time I had in this first 5 minutes, and now for 5 
   minutes I yield to the Senator from Missouri.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator MCCAIN and Senator LOTT to introduce legislation designed to modernize the manner in which registered securities broker-dealers, transfer agents, and investment advisers serve millions of American investors every day. 
   Only a few years ago, a few pioneering brokerage firms, utilizing the vast potential of the Internet, began to revolutionize the securities industry by offering individual investors the opportunity to buy and sell stocks online. Because of the lower costs of electronic transactions, investors have found they can place trades online at a mere fraction of the price they were paying for services at traditional brokerage firms. They have also found that online brokerage firms offer them access to a wide array of information, investing assistance, and research that previously was available only to institutional investors. Almost overnight, many investors have demonstrated their preference for the savings and the empowerment that online brokerage services give them. 
   For example, today Charles Schwab, which has been at the forefront of offering electronic services, reports that it has approximately 2.5 million active online accounts and that more than 50 percent of its custoemr trades are placed online. Since Schwab offers its customers multiple channels of access to its trading services, the fact that more than half of its customer trades are placed online is a dramatic illustration of the investing public's enthusiasm for and acceptance of online services. The dramatic emergence of online-only brokerage firms, such as E*Trade, Discover and Ameritrade, and the continued migration of traditional brokerage firms to the Web is further evidence of this. Soon, millions of securities transactions will be conducted electronically every day. 
   Unfortunately, the full potential of online investing has been impeded because of antiquated laws that do not yet take account of electronic commerce. These laws act as barriers to the efficiencies and investor empowerment opportunities that the online brokerage industry offers. Now, once again, it is time for the government to catch up to the market developments spurred by the technology sector. It is time for the government to remove impediments to online investing. 
   Today, when a person wishes to become a customer of an online broker, he can visit the web-sites of various brokerage firms to compare the value and services those firms offer. He may even provide some information about himself and the type of account he wishes to establish. However, because of traditional principles of contract law and certain recordkeeping requirements, an investor cannot open the account online with any legal certainty. Instead, he must print the application and physically sign and send it by regular mail. The technology gap demonstrated here must be bridged. Investors who, once their accounts are opened, may access investment tools and research and quickly submit trade orders online, should not have to wait days or perhaps even weeks to complete the process for opening an account. This system can and should be changed. 
   Continuing to require pen-and-ink signatures on account applications and other documents, when secure electronic signature technology exists, imposes unnecessary costs and inefficiencies on brokerage firms and customers alike. Similar costs and inefficiencies have been recognized and removed in other areas of securities regulation, such as recordkeeping and document delivery. Today, brokerage firms can store documents in electronic rather than paper format and are allowed to deliver many documents, such as prospectuses, to customers electronically. There is no reason why the advantages of technology cannot and should not be extended to documents that require a signature. 
   The legislation my colleagues and I introduce today would do just that by facilitating and enabling the use of electronic signatures by registered broker-dealers and others in the securities industry in their business dealings with customers and other 
   transactional parties. The legislation would make clear that individuals can open a brokerage account and conduct business with a brokerage firm using an electronic signature as proof of identification and intent. It would also give both brokerage firms and their customers the assurance that they can rely on electronic signatures in their business dealings and that the validity of those dealings will not be challenged merely because a pen-and-ink signature was not used. 
   At this point I think it is important to stress to my colleagues that the online brokerage industry is different from the day-trading industry, which has received a lot of negative attention in the past year. Day-trading firms offer a specialized service that enables their customers to enter orders and trade directly with the market. And while I am sure that most of these businesses are legitimate and sound, in recent months reports of abusive or questionable practices have emerged in relation to this type of trading. Anecdotal accounts tell of investors losing many times the amount of money they originally brought to the market. 
   The online investing services provided by brokerage firms are quite different from the services provided by day-trading firms. For example, brokerage firms such as Charles Schwab, E*Trade, DLJ Direct, Discover, among others, set strict limits on the extent to which investors are permitted access to margin and option accounts. These firms empower their customers and are not the problem, and it is important that my colleagues and the public understand the differences. 
   It is that simple. Frankly, I am surprised that the SEC does not require the use of electronic signatures, because unless a physical signature is witnessed, electronic signatures are a far more reliable means of guaranteeing a person is who they say they are. Electronic signatures may result from a variety of technological means that allow users to confirm the authenticity of an electronic documents author, location or content. These technologies are designed to allow contracts to be reviewed and agreed to electronically, to permit individuals and businesses to safely purchase goods online, and to enable government agencies to verify the authenticity of information submitted to them. It is a natural fit for transactions between online brokerage firms and investors. 
   Despite the changes being made in the investor-brokerage relationship, we recognize that the Securities and Exchange Commission must retain full  regulatory authority in this industry. This legislation therefore authorizes the SEC to provide guidance on the use of electronic signatures by broker-dealers and others in the securities industry. The SECs active involvement in the move from physical to electronic signatures is important. If the change is to be orderly, the Commission must be familiar with the various types of electronic signatures available. The Commission, as the expert regulator of the securities industry, may determine that some forms of signature are superior to others for certain types of records. 
   Mr. President, the securities industry is experiencing explosive growth in electronic transactions, and this bill's response is necessary and appropriate. The industry and the investors who utilize this medium need the efficiencies and certainty this bill would provide. I believe that the more efficient transaction procedures that will result from the bill will translate into cost savings for customers and industry alike. And that should be the ultimate purpose of any securities legislation relating to electronic commerce. 
   Again, I would like to thank Senator MCCAIN and the majority leader for joining me in introducing this legislation. I hope the Senate Banking Committee can move on this legislation in the near future. 
   I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this legislation be printed into the RECORD.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to join my distinguished colleague Senator HOLLINGS in introducing legislation to defend the truth and the integrity of the ``Made in USA'' label. 
   This is the second time, Mr. President, that the Senator from South Carolina and I have worked together to defend the ``Made in USA'' label. 
   Last Congress, when the Federal Trade Commission proposed to dilute the meaning of the ``Made in USA'' label by allowing that label on products with substantial foreign content, Senator HOLLINGS and I introduced a bipartisan resolution opposing this plan. 
   Our resolution urged the FTC to restore the traditional and honest standard for the use of the ``Made in USA'' label. That standard, which has been in existence for more than 50 years, is that products must be ``all or virtually all'' made in the U.S.A. in order to earn the label ``Made in USA.'' 
   Mr. President, there was an overwhelming outpouring of grassroots support from the American people for this straightforward and honest standard and for our Resolution. In just a few months, a total of 256 Members of Congress, including the Majority and Minority Leaders of the U.S. Senate, joined us as cosponsors of our Senate Resolution and its companion bill in the House. 
   We were extremely pleased to see the FTC reverse its decision to dilute the ``Made in USA'' label and return to the traditional and time-tested standard for the use of the label. Frankly, this is the only standard that makes sense to the American consumers. If it says ``Made in USA'' the U.S. consumer has a right to expect that the entire product and all of its components was made by U.S. citizens. 
   This standard is honest. It is clear. It provides value for all those who look for the label and for those who have earned the use of it. 
   But in order to retain that value, the integrity of the ``Made in USA'' label must be defended. We cannot and will not permit the ``Made in USA'' label to be used misleadingly. It belongs to those American businesses and workers who follow the rules, pay the taxes, and work hard--often against the odds presented by unfair foreign competition--to continue to manufacture products here in America. 
   These workers are correct to insist that Congress protect this cherished symbol of American pride and workmanship from abuse and misuse. 
   That is why Senator HOLLINGS and I recently informed our colleagues of our intention to introduce ``The `Made in USA' Label Defense Act of 1999.'' 
   This legislation is necessary to close loopholes that currently allow the ``Made in USA'' label to be misused. These loopholes must be closed to prevent the inappropriate and misleading use of this label at the expense of American consumers, taxpayers, and U.S. workers. 
   The particular misuse of the ``Made in USA'' label which we seek to address involves a U.S. territory, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or as it is sometimes referred to, Saipan. 
   To understand how this situation arose, some history is in order. 
   Saipan was the site of an important battle in World War II which cost America 15,000 casualties. Following the end of the war, it was administered by the U.S. on behalf of the United Nations as a district of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands from 1947 to 1986. In 1986, Saipan came under U.S. sovereignty pursuant to a Covenant that was approved by popular vote in Saipan and by the U.S. Congress (Public Law 94-241.) At that point, Saipan, now known as the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or CNMI, became an insular possession of the United States. 
   CNMI negotiators for this Covenant sought an exemption from U.S. immigration laws. This exemption was granted, but it came with a clear warning from the Reagan Administration: the exemption was not to be used to bring in a permanent alien labor force in order to evade duties and quotas on Asian textile products and to provide unfair competition to domestic textile industry. The duty free and quota free treatment provided to Headnote 3(a) industries such as textiles was to benefit local U.S. citizens living and working in the CNMI. 
   In a letter to the Governor of the CNMI in May of 1986, the year in which the Covenant was adopted, the Assistant Secretary for Territorial and International Affairs of Interior Department in the Reagan Administration, Richard R. Montoya, issued the following clear warnings to the Government of the CNMI:  
   The recent news reports on the tremendous growth in alien labor in the Northern Mariana Islands are extremely disturbing....... I would be remiss if I did not speak frankly to you on the possible consequences of the NMI's alien labor policy. 
   As I have often stated, the intent of the Congress in providing the privilege of Headnote 3(a) to the territories is to benefit local and not alien job and business growth. The extensive and permanent use of alien labor in Headnote 3(a) industries is an abuse which cannot be tolerated by the [Reagan] Administration. 
   The objectives of the recently negotiated Covenant financial agreement could be derailed as the wholesale transfer of U.S. tax, trade and social benefits to non-U.S. citizens occurs under the CNMI's alien labor promotion policies.  
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to insert the full text of this letter, dated May 7, 1986, from then-Assistant Secretary Richard Montoya to the then-Governor of the CNMI, Pedro Tenorio, at this point in my remarks. 
   At the time of the concerns raised in this letter, the total number of aliens in the CNMI was a mere 6,600 people. Today, the number of alien workers in the textile industry alone greatly exceeds this number. The number of non-U.S. citizens in the CNMI now tops 35,000, and actually exceeds the number of U.S. citizens in the territory. In fact, 91 percent of the entire private sector workforce is composed of alien labor. 
   Even more alarming, Mr. President, we are now told by U.S. Government officials and news media investigations that the People's Republic of China itself may actually be involved in running some of these garment factories in Saipan. According to the February 8, 1998 Philadelphia Inquirer: ``One of the biggest island factories is Marianas Garment Manufacturing, Inc.--indirectly owned by the China National Textiles Import and Export Corp. (Chinatech), a behemoth that handles $1.2 billion in Chinese textile exports to the world, much of it to the United States.'' If this is true, then companies owned by the communist Chinese government have succeeded in deceiving U.S. consumers and evading U.S. trade laws. Clearly, this is a situation that demands the immediate attention of and a firm response by both parties in the Congress. 
   But what concerns Senator HOLLINGS and myself and what directly prompted us to introduce this legislation is the direct effect of the CNMI situation on American consumers. 
   First, American consumers are deceived by the fact that, due to a loophole in U.S. law, the more than $1 billion worth of textile products that are now shipped each year from the CNMI to the U.S. can be legally labeled as ``Made in USA''--even though they are made with nearly all foreign labor and foreign materials. 
   This deceives American consumers, who have a right to expect that products labeled as ``Made in USA'' are made by U.S. workers with U.S. materials. 
   Second, American taxpayers are harmed because these foreign goods are allowed to be imported into the U.S. duty-free--as if they were made by U.S. workers. As the CNMI was so clearly warned by the Reagan Administration, duty free treatment for textiles from the insular possessions was designed to help local U.S. citizens in these territories. 
   This abuse of our duty-Free laws is costing American taxpayers an estimated $200 million annually. This $200 million could be used to fund a tax cut to the American people or could be used to reduce other duties. 
   Mr. President, let me say that I am a strong believer in free trade. I believe the U.S. and the whole world benefits form the unfettered movement of goods and services. 
   But the fact that foreign garment exports to the U.S are laundered in Saipan to escape duties and quotas has  nothing to do with free trade and everything to do with a form of subterfuge. We cannot allow those nations whose imports are subject to lawful duties and quotas to evade these laws at the expense of American taxpayers. 
   Third, American workers also are being harmed by this situation because the $200 million which these foreign imports escape paying to the U.S. Treasury acts as a subsidy for these misleadingly labeled products. 
   Mr. President, in order to address these concerns, I am proud to join today with my colleague from South Carolina in introducing a tightly crafted and narrowly drawn piece of legislation that will address these concerns. 
   Our bill is designed to protect Americans from the deleterious effects of the current situation by closing what we believe our colleagues will agree are two indefensible loopholes in current law:

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to His Highness Shaikh Essa Bin Salman Al-Khalifa, the late Amir of the State of Bahrain. The people of Bahrain recently commemorated the 40th day of mourning for their great leader who passed away on the 6th of March. Shaikh Essa was known for his kindness and compassion and will be dearly missed by both the people of Bahrain and his friends around the world. 
   Shaikh Essa was a visionary leader who helped transform the Bahraini economy from an oil-based economy to an economy of trade, investment, banking, and service. These improvements led to Bahrain achieving one of the highest standards of living among the Arab countries. 
   Under Shaikh Essa, Bahrain strengthened its relationship with the West. In 1903, Mason Memorial, the first American hospital in the region, was established. It has since become a landmark. In 1932, when Bahrain became the first country in the southern Gulf region to discover oil, American expertise backed the exploration. This year Bahrain is celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the strong friendship it has with the United States and our Navy. The Bahrani Ambassador to the United States, His Excellency Mohammad Abdul Ghaffar Abdulla, continues to do a wonderful job in keeping this strong friendship alive. 
   My condolences go out to the people of Bahrain and Shaikh Essa's family. I wish to extend my warmest regards to His Highness Shaikh Hamad Bin Essa Al-Khalifa, who has succeeded his father as the new Amir of Bahrain. I am certain he will follow his father's path and continue to keep allied relations between Bahrain and the United States.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Drug Testing and Treatment for Welfare Recipients Act of 1999. This legislation would establish a pilot program encouraging up to 5 States to implement drug testing and treatment programs for people receiving assistance through the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families Block Grant (TANF); the AFDC replacement established through the 1996 welfare reform law. It would fund these programs through three year competitive grants,  providing States with the resources and flexibility they need to establish the most effective drug testing and treatment programs for their communities. 
   Mr. President, across the nation, welfare caseloads are dropping. More and more welfare recipients are working to provide for their families and moving closer to complete independence from public assistance. According to the Congressional Research Service, in March of 1994 5.1 million families received assistance through the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (AFDC). By September of 1998, those numbers had dropped to 2.9 million families receiving assistance through the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) block grant program. 
   This 43% decline in the welfare caseload is encouraging. But it should not stop our efforts to help those hard-to-serve cases still on the rolls. Individuals who continue to receive welfare payments face daunting barriers to employment. One such barrier is drug addiction. People who are addicted to drugs have great trouble concentrating, keeping set schedules and maintaining basic order in their lives. For them, steady employment is often simply out of reach. 
   According to the Administration's Office of National Drug Control Policy, drug abuse has plagued America for over a century. It has torn families apart, regardless of socio-economic background as it has destroyed individual lives and spawned crime and social breakdown. Drugs pose a threat to the individual, the family, and the community. Individuals dependent on illegal substances cannot take care of themselves, much less their children, and drug dependence often leads to other crimes. Desperate to feed their addiction, abusers are often forced into theft, assault, or even worse crimes in the search for that next hit. 
   Today, an estimated 12.8 million Americans use illegal drugs. Approximately 45% of Americans know someone with a substance abuse problem. And the problem is particularly acute among young people preparing to enter adult life and the adult workforce. 25 percent of 12th graders still use illegal drugs regularly, as do 20 percent of 10th graders and 12 percent of 8th graders. 
   To combat the debilitating effects of drugs on addicts and those around them, this bill would enable States to fund drug testing and treatment programs for welfare recipients in their communities. It would do this by establishing a three year competitive grant program. States would apply for this grant by submitting a drug testing and treatment plan for their welfare recipients. The Secretary of Health and 
   Human Services would then award the grant to up to 5 states in the amount of $1.5 million per year per state for three years, bringing the total cost of this grant program to $22.5 million. 
   The award decision will be based on two factors: (1) the need and ability of the State to address drug abuse by welfare recipients and (2) the ability of the State to continue such testing and treatment programs after the 3 year grant subsidies. Upon receiving the grant, States would be required to distribute the monies to entities already receiving funds through the Federal Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment block grant (SAPT), the primary tool the federal government uses to support State substance abuse prevention and treatment programs. The States may allocate the funds in any manner they deem appropriate to establish programs that best serve their communities. 
   Mr. President, we often talk about breaking the cycle of poverty, and I believe that goes hand in hand with winning the drug war. I would like to read a brief quotation from the Administration's Office of National Drug Control Policy's National Drug Control Strategy. I think it makes an important point: ``While drug use and its consequences threaten Americans of every socio-economic background.*.*.*.the effects of drug use are often felt disproportionally. Neighborhoods where illegal drug markets flourish are plagued by attendant crime and violence.'' I have always been a strong advocate of community renewal and I truly believe that when we begin building drug-free families, safer streets, safer communities and more opportunities for our nation's economically disadvantaged will follow. 
   Treatment for welfare recipients engaged in illegal drug use is the most important form of assistance they will ever receive. The Office of National Drug Control Policy points out that ``Americans who lack comprehensive health plans and have smaller incomes may be less able to afford treatment programs to overcome drug dependence.'' 
   Mr. President, this bill would put drug treatment dollars in the hands of those who need it most. States need these funds to help finance more comprehensive treatment programs not covered by Medicaid. Comprehensive services are desperately needed for the most serious victims of drug abuse. This grant program constitutes a small investment that would encourage States to address drug abuse by welfare recipients, further reducing rates of welfare dependency and other social problems related to drug addiction. 
   Ultimately, our goal is to help individuals provide for their families and achieve independence by breaking the cycle of dependency. This legislation will help significantly in that effort and I encourage my colleagues to give it their support.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. The Small Business Survival Committee, or SBSC, is a nonpartisan, nonprofit small business advocacy group with more than 50,000 members. These materials give a small business perspective on recent actions of the Department of Justice's Antitrust division, and of the action against Microsoft in particular. 
   As the SBSC point out, we are in an era of renewed activism on the part of the Antitrust Division. Since 1994 that Division has pursued more than 274 antitrust cases. The Antitrust Division was set up to protect consumers and our free enterprise system. But these materials demonstrate that it is questionable whether this new activism is in fact helpful to small businesses and entrepreneurs. 
   In particular, the SBSC questions whether the government's action against Microsoft, along with the concomitant actions of the state attorneys general, will not actually hurt small businesses and entrepreneurs who have profited from Microsoft's innovative practice. Worse, significant harm may be done to our ability to compete and to our very system of free enterprise, by the draconian measures being put forward in these talks. 
   Breaking up Microsoft or worse yet subjecting it and its suppliers to government approved contracting procedures will destroy business flexibility and substitute bureaucratic empire-building for free market competition as the force behind new initiatives. This would be tragic for all Americans as it would deny us the economic growth, innovation and freedom that open competition has provided for so long. 
   I hope my colleagues will study these and other materials as we consider the proper course for antitrust law in our political and economic systems.  
   Big Antitrust Cases Will Hurt `Little Guys'  
   Small-business owners seldom go running to the federal government for protection when competition threatens their market position. 
   But that, unfortunately, has become the strategy for some big businesses who see their market share eroding due to aggressive competition from a rival. 
   The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice is currently being used by America's top CEOs who give up on the marketplace, essentially using the government as a temporary cushion against bleeding market share. 
   But make no mistake, due to the desperate pleadings of such big corporations, small businesses as consumers, suppliers--and even competitors--of successful big companies under attack will suffer from this excessive meddling in the marketplace. 
   Headed by Joel Klein, the antitrust division is operating with renewed vigor. If you care to take a look at Justice's web site, it proudly lists more than 274 antitrust cases brought by the U.S. government since December 1994 (along with amicus curiae briefs in 31 other cases). 
   ``The criteria for antitrust investigations or lawsuits seems to be if a company merges or wildly succeeds, then it may be ripe for antitrust action. When government moves against successful businesses, the entrepreneurial sector of the economy pays a price, too,'' said Small Business Survival Committee chief economist Raymond Keating. 
   Keating argues that antitrust actions generally seek to supplant the wisdom of consumers with government regulators as the final arbiter to protect politically connected businesses that fail to adequately compete. He says small businesses that have gained from the success and innovation of companies under attack--Microsoft Corp. being a good example--will ultimately lose from aggressive antitrust action. 
   Most troublesome is the permanent damage inflicted on the company under attack and the impact on its small-business suppliers. 
   Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman recently said that the companies of Silicon Valley that encouraged Justice action against Microsoft are displaying ``suicidal'' behavior. The door has been opened for new regulations in an ``industry relatively free from government intrusions,'' he warned the industry at a CATO-sponsored event. 
   A new period has dawned in corporate America where some feel safe running to the government for protection and solace rather than responding to competition with better ways to serve consumers. 
   An activist antitrust division has helped to fuel this rather co-dependent behavior. Its doors are thrust open to all pleaders who wish to use the government to sideline or district the competition. A costly government investigation is one way to put the best brains of a business competitor into nonproductive status, warding off potential bad press and other fallouts that often accompany an antitrust challenge. 
   The government's pursuit of Microsoft is a bogus venture, according to Citizens Against Government Waste. In October, the group released a survey that showed 83 percent of the public views the case against Microsoft as a waste of federal and state taxpayer funds. 
   ``With new evidence every day of the weakness in the government's case, it's only a matter of whether the government wants to wait 13 years, as it did in the IBM case,'' said CAGW president Tom Schatz. 
   According to the antitrust division's own literature, its work is supposed to be focused on protecting consumers and our system of free enterprise. What's becoming more clear is that its work is doing much more to thwart competition by protecting whiny competitors at the expense of free enterprise.   
   Is Antitrust Anti-Entrepreneur?  
   Once again, merger activity in the U.S. economy has accelerated. Among the proposed or consummated corporate marriages of 1998 are Chrysler Corporation and Daimler-Benz, American Online Inc. and Netscape Communications Corp., Deutsche Bank AG and Bankers Trust Co., Unum Corp, and Provident Cos., Tyco International Ltd. and AMP Inc., MCI Communications Corp. and WorldCom Inc., Cargill Inc. and Continental Grain Co., Bell Atlantic Corp. and GTE Corp., Wells Fargo & Co. and Northwest Corp., AT&T Corp. and TeleCommunications Inc., Exxon Corp and Mobil Corp., along with a host of others. 
   Of course, such mergers raise the antennae of government antitrust regulations at the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). These days, however, it does not seem to take very much to get the attention of the rather activist antitrust division headed by Joel Klein at the DoJ. Indeed, at the DoJ's website, the antitrust division lists 274 antitrust cases brought by the U.S. government since December 1994, along with Amicus Curiae briefs in 31 other cases. 
   And a proposed merger certainly is not required to warrant antitrust attention. For example, an antitrust case was filed in early October 1998 against Visa USA and Master-Card International. The FTC has filed suit against Intel Corp. And of course, DoJ is now in court against Microsoft Corp. 
   The criteria for antitrust investigations or lawsuits seems to be if a company merges or wildly succeeds, then it may be ripe for antitrust action. Of course, this problem springs from the combination of vague legislation (i.e., primarily the Sherman Act of 1890 and the Clayton Act of 1914) with zealous government lawyers and regulators. 
   While at first glance the issue of antitrust may seem remote to most small businesses and entrepreneurs, it does have an impact on and should be a concern to the entrepreneurial sector of our economy. In general, antitrust actions are anti-entrepreneur, and the reasons go far beyond the basic idea that the next Microsoft lurks among today's small or start-up firms, and will some day have to face the wrath of antitrust regulators. 
   Entrepreneurs as Consumers. Perhaps most obviously, small businesses are affected by antitrust regulation in their role as consumers. For example, small businesses are customers in almost every industry touched by antitrust actions--from telecommunications to computers to gasoline to grain to the Internet. 
   Any time our most successful businesses come under regulatory assault, consumers are bound to lose. Entangle companies in antitrust litigation and resources are diverted away from serving consumers, and instead put toward battling the government. Just ask IBM. The increased costs of government arrogantly overruling decisions made in the marketplace ultimately fall on the backs of consumers. After all, the consumer acts as final judge and jury in the marketplace. They ultimately decide the success or failure of mergers, who gains market share, and who loses market share. Transfer this power to government bureaucrats, and consumers--including small businesses--obviously suffer. 
   Entrepreneurs as Suppliers. In addition, government overriding the wisdom of millions of individuals in the marketplace directly hurts small business and entrepreneurs who supply goods and services to the firm under antitrust assault. Businesses who serve customers well and gain market share as a result, or those pulling off successful mergers, create new opportunities for entrepreneurs and small enterprises. Consultants, construction businesses, food services, dry cleaners, retail stores, and seemingly countless other suppliers grow up around these larger businesses. These smaller businesses inevitably get hit with the fallout from an antitrust attack on the larger companies. 
   Entrepreneurs as Competitors. Some might believe that smaller enterprises favor antitrust action as a means to hobble a dominant competitor. In fact, an overwhelming number of antitrust assaults begin with a faltering or less efficient firm trying to get the government to impede their successful competitor. 
   However, this most certainly is a case against antitrust action, not for it. The only possible beneficiary would be the firm seeking government protection, and any resulting advantage for that business would at  best be temporary as the market would still be working to weed out inefficiencies and reveal their shortcomings--and justifiably so. 
   In general, the entrepreneurial sector of the economy gains nothing by having government step in and punish success, or dictate which companies are allowed to merge. 
   Entrepreneurs vs. Regulators. Indeed, any further empowerment of regulators does not serve the over-regulated entrepreneur at all. Government stepping in and dictating business practices, assaulting efforts to gain market share, and punishing success goes far in shaking the confidence in and of business. Under such circumstances, the business environment becomes inclement for all. And one can easily envision robust antitrust regulation spilling into other regulatory arenas. 
   Entrepreneurs and Economics. The fundamental problem with antitrust regulation is that it rests on unsound economics. In reality, the economy is not the sterile, neat model of perfect competition taught in economics textbooks and desired by government lawyers. Instead, it is a tumultuous, ongoing struggle among enterprises to create temporary monopolies through innovation, invention and efficiencies. Those temporary monopolies are subsequently attacked and surpassed by competitors. Entrepreneurs, unlike many in government, understand this rivalry between current and future competitors. 
   Indeed, it is difficult, if not impossible, to think of a true monopoly--i.e., one supplier in an industry with no real or close substitutes--ever emerging from the competitive marketplace. Where true monopolies have existed, it was the government that either created, aided, or protected it (e.g., telephony, electricity, and education). The vaunted idea of predatory pricing--whereby a business lowers it prices below cost in order to destroy competitors, monopolize the market, and then hike prices dramatically--fails the reality test. It's never happened. The potential losses such a strategy would have to incur would be enormous and unpredictable. And even if it were to eventually succeed, consumers would have benefited enormously, and subsequent price increases would bring competitors back into the market. 
   Antitrust regulation at its core is contradictory. It purports to protect consumers from evil monopolies and so-called ``anti-competitive activity,'' but it is, in fact, consumers who make the final decisions in the market. In this light, antitrust regulation is revealed to be little more than another elitist government effort to protect us from ourselves. Antitrust actions generally seek to supplant the consumer with the government regulator as final arbiter in order to protect politically connected businesses who fail to adequately compete. 
   In the end, small businesses and entrepreneurs are not immune to the costs of government antitrust activism. None of us are.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Greater Pontiac Community Coalition for its ten year anniversary of their Youth In Government and Business program. 
   The Greater Pontiac Community Coalition was founded by Reverend Douglas P. Jones, Pastor of the Welcome Missionary Baptist Church in Pontiac, Michigan, who serves as President of the Greater Pontiac Community Coalition. 
   The program has promoted educational excellence among middle and high school students, with over 3,500 youth participating in this fine program. 
   This year students were taught about government, law enforcement, education and business through hands-on visits with state and local officials representing each of those segments of the community. Valuable experiences are garnered through the Youth in Government and Business, inspiring many to carry the torch of community leadership into the future. 
   Building on his past successes, Reverend Jones now plans to engage the program at the elementary school level, and his program is also being duplicated in other communities in Metropolitan Detroit. This is a testament to the success faith-based and community-based efforts can have in making a difference for our youth. 
   I want to express my congratulations to Pastor Jones and wish him and all graduates continued success. Most importantly, I would like to thank him for his commitment to the youth in our communities.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Ed and Marlene Baker as they celebrate the 90th Anniversary of the Italian Tribune. 
   The Italian Tribune was founded as a weekly newspaper by Vincent and Mary O. Giuliano in 1909 and has chronicled Italian-Americans for most of the 20th Century. 
   The Italian Tribune has sustained the link between American life and Italian culture which is vital in exemplifying how we are a nation of immigrants and how America has provided opportunities for those who have come to her shores. 
   The Tribune is one of the oldest weekly, and now bi-weekly, Italian-American newspapers in the United States and has kept Italian-American residents in Michigan informed for nine decades, bringing them news in the accurate manner and serving as an important community forum. 
   The paper continually promotes loyalty to the United States, pride of Italian heritage and fraternal spirit to a community of over 350,000 first, second and third generation Americans of Italian descent in Michigan. 
   Since the original issue was printed, the Tribune has gone through many changes, and is now published by Edward and Marlene Baker, descendants of the founding Giulianos. 
   I want to express my congratulations to Ed and Marlene Baker as they celebrate the 90th Anniversary of the Italian Tribune, making it a part of life for hundreds of thousands of people. The longevity of the paper is a testament to their diligence and the sacrifices made by Vincent and Mary O. Giuliano.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, just a quick response. The cloture vote which we will be having is cloture on the amendment. It is not cloture on the bill. If we were able to invoke cloture, then we would go to a vote ultimately on this amendment. But assuming that amendment was then dispensed with, either by passage or failure in a final vote, the bill itself would remain on the floor subject to other amendments which could include, of course, the ones that have been alluded to by the Senator from North Dakota and a variety of other people; the Senator from South Carolina has talked about his approach; and so on. 
   Our goal is simply to get a vote on this amendment, and then we can consider other options after that. So I want to clarify this for all Senators. This is a vote on cloture on this amendment. It is not cloture on the bill, so the bill would still be subject to other amendments if and when we dispense with this. 
   At this time I yield such time as he may need to the distinguished Senator from Texas.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield myself an initial 5 minutes, and if the Chair will let me know when that time is reached, we will see how much time is remaining to speak. 
   I have had the pleasure of listening now for about 3 days to a variety of criticisms raised by the other side of the aisle on this amendment, almost all of which are baseless in every conceivable way. Some of them, I think, are caused by failure to read it, some because of a reliance on letters received from the Department of Treasury before it had even been drafted, and some for reasons that are frankly, to me, still confusing--the most recent being the comments of the distinguished ranking member of the Budget Committee that they have had no opportunity to address the issue. What we have before us is cloture on this amendment, not cloture on this bill. If cloture is invoked, then we will go ultimately to a vote on this amendment, and once it is dispensed with, up or down, the bill will still be available for amendment. If there are better lockbox proposals or alternative proposals, there will be an opportunity for that. 
   Let me also say, this Senator certainly is receptive to, and anxious to hear from, the Secretary of the Treasury or anybody else with respect to ways to perfect the approach we have taken. But what we have tried to do is simply put into a legislative form that which we passed as part of our budget resolution on a 99-0 vote. What that said, very simply, was we were going to reduce the Federal debt held by the public because it is a national priority; that Social Security surpluses should be used for Social Security reform, or to reduce the debt held by the public and should not be used for any other purpose. 
   Mr. President, 99 people voted for this. Now, all of a sudden, we hear that having the words ``Social Security reform'' in this amendment is some kind of diabolical plot; or using the Social Security surplus to pay down the national debt is somehow a threat to the economy. If people believe that, I cannot imagine why they voted in the first place 99-0 for this amendment when it was offered by myself and others during the budget resolution debate. The only thing that has happened since then is that we have tried to put into legislative context that which everybody said they were for. If there are criticisms of this, I think they would have to be technical ones because the basic principles that were voted on 99-0 are exactly what are embodied in this amendment before us today. 
   We recently heard the statement: Who are the real friends of Social Security? We will find that out here in a few minutes. The question will be this, and this will be a question for seniors and those who will soon be recipients of Social Security benefits to answer for themselves: Are your friends the people who want to make sure the Social Security surpluses are protected from being spent or used for other Government programs or tax cuts or anything other than to reduce the national debt? Or are your friends the people who want to spend the Social Security surplus, such as the President proposed in his budget, or those who will vote against a provision, this amendment, that would protect the surpluses from being spent? 
   Every time I talk to seniors in my State, I hear complaints that we have plundered the Social Security trust fund and spent those dollars on other things. This amendment is designed to put an end to that, to require 60 Senators to stand on this floor and to vote to spend Social Security money on something other than Social Security. Yet all of a sudden we find all kinds of excuses to oppose that. 
   We will let the seniors decide who their friends really are. I think for too long we have seen these surplus dollars spent on other Government programs. It is time for that to stop. It is time for those dollars to be protected, to be used to pay down the public debt, or used as part of a Social Security modernization program. And that is not going to happen until we have bipartisan consensus on such a program. 
   In the meantime, do we send those dollars off to other priorities in the budget, or do we put them into the reduction of the publicly held debt so that we, in fact, strengthen the economy, reduce our interest payments, and make more funds available in the future for Social Security when it will need it?

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I was about to ask what business we were on, and the Chair has answered the question. 
   What I will do now is talk for a few minutes about the reasoning behind the amendment I brought on behalf of myself and Senators DOMENICI, ASHCROFT, LOTT, NICKLES and several others, the so-called Social Security lockbox. 
   First, I think it is important for our constituents to understand exactly what process happens now and what has been happening to their Social Security payroll taxes. 
   If you are a working American, Social Security payroll taxes are taken out of your paycheck. Most Americans rue that little FICA box, as they know it means a reduction in the amount of take-home pay they have. The money that falls under the Social Security component of the FICA tax goes into the Social Security trust fund. From there it is used to pay Social Security benefits to retirees. 
   Right now, however, the Social Security trust fund is taking in more money in taxes than it is paying out in benefits. We are doing that because in 1982 and 1983, as a result of the Bipartisan Commission's recommendations, we came up with an increase in the payroll taxes, the goal of which was to begin to build a surplus that could be used to meet the retirement demands, in terms of the system, of baby boomers. 
   As a result, over the next 10 years, starting this year, Social Security will build up a surplus of $1.8 trillion. That means 1.8 trillion more payroll tax dollars are going to go into the Social Security trust fund than will be needed to meet the retirement benefit paychecks that will be paid during that timeframe. 
   As I think most Americans know, and it seems at least virtually every senior or person nearing senior citizen age in my State that I meet with knows, Social Security surpluses have, in recent years, been used to mask the size of the Federal deficit and basically to finance other Government spending--everything from foreign aid to funding for the bureaucracy in the Internal Revenue Service. 
   Now, however, Mr. President, as a result of the hard work this Congress and previous Congresses have done in the last several years, we are on the verge of balancing the budget without using the Social Security surplus. In fact, over the next 10 years, the Federal Government will accumulate a total budget surplus of $2.7 trillion--$1.8 trillion, as I mentioned, in the Social Security trust fund and $900 billion in non-Social Security surpluses. 
   The question, then, is what should we do with the Social Security surpluses that we are contemplating generating over the next 10 years? Should we continue spending those surpluses on other Government programs, on new spending programs, or on increases in existing programs? Or should we save those dollars for Social Security? Remember, that was the intent of developing the surplus, to set aside additional surplus Social Security dollars for the day when Social Security income is no longer meeting its outflow in terms of paychecks. 
   Well, those of us bringing this amendment today say, very simply, let's save it all. We want to save every penny of every dollar to fix the Social Security program, to modernize the program, so that it is ready to meet the demands of the 21st century. If we don't pass a Social Security modernization plan, then it is our belief that that money should be used to reduce the public debt and not used for new spending programs, for tax cuts, or for anything else. 
   That is the purpose of the legislation we are offering in the form of this amendment--to set up, in effect, a safe-deposit box into which we would put Social Security surpluses to guarantee that they are used solely to modernize Social Security or to pay down the debt. 
   Mr. President, this protection is needed. It is needed because, without it, the Social Security surplus will be spent. President Clinton said in a press statement of November 15, 1995, that he wanted ``to assure the American people that the Social Security trust fund will not be used for any purpose other than to pay benefits to recipients.'' 
   ``Under current law,'' he went on to say, ``the Secretary of the Treasury is not authorized to use the fund for any purpose other than to pay benefits to recipients. There will be no exceptions under my watch. None. Not ever.'' 
   That is pretty unequivocal language: The Social Security trust fund will not be used for any purpose other than to pay benefits to recipients. Unfortunately, in 1998, as you will recall, the President threatened to shut down the Government if we didn't appropriate $21 billion in new Federal spending, to be funded, in effect, from the Social Security surplus. And now the Congressional Budget Office reports and has estimated that the President's latest budget, the one he submitted in February, spends $158 billion of the Social Security surplus--20 percent of the surplus that will be generated over the next 5 years on non-Social Security programs. 
   If we have learned anything else over the last several 
   years, we should have learned beyond a shadow of a doubt that money left in Washington will be spent in Washington. That includes money in the Social Security trust fund. 
   I have singled out the President in my comments here because of this year's budget submission, as well as last year's spending bills; but it is not one side of the aisle alone that has a tendency to spend dollars. We have all voted for spending bills here that have taken the Social Security trust fund money and spent it elsewhere. In my judgment, the failure of the current budget process to provide safeguards against such spending demands that we put in place the kind of safe-deposit lockbox we are discussing here today in order to make sure that in the future the Social Security surplus dollars are protected, because unless we protect that surplus, in my judgment, it will be spent and we will not have adequate money to make sure that Social Security is not only available to today's seniors but tomorrow's seniors as well. 
   The purpose of our Social Security lockbox is to make Social Security funds unavailable to those who want to spend them. First, it reaffirms that Social Security is off budget. Second, it establishes a 60-vote Senate point of order against any resolution or legislation that spends the Social Security surplus. Third, it establishes in law a declining limit on the amount of debt to be held by the public, which keeps Social Security moneys from being spent on Washington programs. 
   In other words, Mr. President, initially on an annual basis, and then on a biannual basis, this legislation would mandate that the publicly held debt be decreased by the amount of money in the Social Security trust fund surplus until such time as we pass Social Security modernization legislation that would use those surpluses. In other words, if Congress does not pass a Social Security modernization plan, we will reduce the public debt, and the total amount over that 10-year period would be over $1.2 trillion--well over $1 trillion that would otherwise have been simply spent would, under this proposal, be used to pay down our debt. That, in turn, would lower interest rates, strengthen our economy, and strengthen the Social Security system accordingly. By strengthening our economy, this debt reduction will directly impact, in my judgment, not only economic growth but the strength of Social Security. 
   Mr. President, in light of the time, I want to turn at this point to some of the comments that have been made on the Senate floor with regard to this amendment. Perhaps the most serious we have heard are serious charges that this amendment would prevent the Federal Government from meeting its  obligation to pay Social Security benefits themselves. This is premised on a letter that was sent by Secretary of the Treasury Rubin some time ago--before this legislation was even drafted, I might add--criticizing the as-yet-to-be-drafted legislation on a number of counts. Some have referred to the letter from Secretary Rubin in expressing his concern about a bill not yet introduced. 
   I urge my colleagues who have raised these concerns to please read the text of the amendment before us today. Let me point out in this regard that no fewer than three provisions in this amendment guarantee that there will be absolutely no disruption of any kind in the payment of Social Security benefits. We attempted--even though we had not yet drafted the legislation--in drafting the initial bill itself, which is 
   offered in this amendment, to make sure that the concerns raised by the Secretary of the Treasury were, in fact, addressed. First, we included a recession trigger, which would suspend these public debt limits in times of recession and reinstate them only after we had recovered from a recession at a newly adjusted public debt level. Second, we included a provision seeing to it that no short-term task management problems would endanger Social Security payments. We have done that very specifically. Finally, we provided for a 7-month delay in implementing the lower debt limit figures--a delay that would make sure that when the publicly held debt limit was reduced, that event would occur at a time when the Treasury was at its maximum annual cash flow position, so that any type of management of money challenges the Secretary of the Treasury might have that might precipitate a short-term cash flow problem would not be encountered. 
   In our judgment, this will provide the Secretary with a buffer that will be more than adequate, in terms of cash flow, to meet all Social Security obligations. In addition, the amendment contains a legal declaration that Social Security benefit payments required by law have priority claim on the U.S. Treasury. Such provision should not be necessary because in the highly unlikely and, indeed, unprecedented case of a default, I would be shocked to find that Secretary Rubin, or any of his successors, would give greater priority to spending dollars on foreign aid, corporate welfare, or the IRS bureaucracy than paying benefits to seniors. Nonetheless, to ensure that does not happen, we have included in this amendment a guarantee that, in the highly unlikely event of a default, Social Security benefits will be paid first. 
   Finally, I must add one other guarantee of Social Security payments. I must mention one, and that is the Members of Congress themselves. I cannot conceive, and I am sure the Presiding Officer cannot conceive, that there is any Member of this body who would not vote to suspend these debt limits immediately if there was any risk of failing to meet our Social Security obligations. That would not happen. I don't think there is a Member in the House or the Senate who would vote to make sure those payments were met, and that is what we have--a point of order that can be overturned by a 60-vote Senate vote on the legislation. 
   Social Security benefits are not endangered by this amendment. They are, in fact, made much safer by its provisions for saving Social Security, as well as the clear priority the amendment gives to all Social Security payments. 
   The bottom line, Mr. President, is that we believe this amendment would make Social Security safer, and that is why 99 Senators recently voted for a sense-of-the-Senate resolution declaring that every nickel of the Social Security surplus should be saved in this way to fix Social Security, or to reduce the public debt. 
   I urge those same 99 Senators to vote for cloture so that we can have an up-or-down vote on this amendment. 
   I also say this. I know there are other Members who have other ways in mind as to how, perhaps, to address the challenge of protecting the Social Security surplus. In fact, I suspect the Senator from South Carolina, who spoke about this yesterday, will perhaps offer an amendment that he offered in committee. That is fine. I think we should offer different proposals. Let's vote them up or down. Let's not prevent votes from taking place. I would like a vote on this amendment, and I would certainly be happy to have a vote on amendments offered from other Members on either side of the aisle. But let's move the process forward. 
   I think most people would like to see us addressing this issue head on and not deferring it and not refusing to take votes on it. I think what we should do is try to offer those various approaches and have the chance to have them debated in the context of the bill on the floor, and then vote on the amendment we are proposing, and on others as well, and we will see where the Senate judgment ultimately lies. 
   In any event, Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak here today, and that I will now replace the Presiding Officer. I notice that the time for that, too, has arrived.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. The issue is what do we do with them, if we don't spend them or use them for more spending programs? 
   The legislation we are proposing says we either use those dollars to fix Social Security to deal with this long-term insolvency, or until we pass such legislation that we would use it to pay down the national debt. 
   In my State, at least, I find an overwhelming number of people who feel that paying down the national debt is the one and only alternative for using these dollars. That makes sense to them because they know that will help us in the long term to address Social Security and solvency and a variety of other challenges that 
   we face as a country.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. As the Senator from South Carolina knows, Mr. President, right now we are spending as much money as the current benefit system requires. We are fulfilling every single benefit which Social Security on an annual basis requires. The question is, If you have additional money, what do the American people want done with it? I think the American people do not want it spent for and don't want to see that additional surplus used for tax cuts. I think the American people are fed up with that. 
   In my judgment, if the amendment were offered and passed, then that money will be spent, or it will be used in one of the fashions you have just described, the very way it has been used since 1983. 
   So the question is which option do we prefer? I would like to see the money used to modernize Social Security. I hope we can on a bipartisan basis come forward with a plan that, in fact, modernizes Social Security for the 21st century. Until we do that, of the three choices left to us, it seems to me that at least the constituents in my State want to make sure that money doesn't get spent. I don't want to see it used for tax cuts. We want to see it used either to fix Social Security, or to bring down the national debt, because by bringing down the national debt we will, in effect, strengthen our position as we attempt to solve Social Security in the long term.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. We are sort of moving a little beyond the question here, I say to the Senator, in that I have to relieve the Presiding Officer. 
   Here is what I say to the Senator from South Carolina. We have a lot of ideas. Senator HOLLINGS has offered in the committee his alternative as to how we should deploy these resources, these surplus dollars. Others have talked about an even bigger lockbox than the one we are proposing that might encompass other areas of Federal spending. That is fine. I am more than happy to debate each of these options. I would just like to see us vote on this option. 
   I would like to see the Members of the Senate have a chance to vote yes or no on the question of whether or not we create as an option to using these dollars for spending or tax cuts the option that would have to be followed of using it to pay down the debt. 
   In my judgment, Mr. President, that is an option that seniors, and people who will soon be seniors, would prefer to see these dollars used for as opposed to the way they have been spent in recent years. 
   But if a majority of the Senate thinks that they prefer to see these dollars spent, whether on tax cuts or new spending programs, they can vote on it. And they should have a chance to vote on it. In fact, tomorrow they will have their first chance to vote on it. I say let's give the various plans their day in court here and let's see if the majority of the Senate supports one over the others. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Senator from South Carolina.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for giving us an opportunity to begin this debate. I realize we have a number of Members on various sides of this issue with different ideas. I think if we have a discussion here, perhaps we can identify some of the concerns and address them. I hope we can because I think this is a topic that needs to have our full attention. 
   Let me begin by saying I have just submitted an amendment here on behalf of myself as well as Senators DOMENICI, ASHCROFT, LOTT, NICKLES, MCCAIN, FRIST, CRAPO, COLLINS, and GRAMS. The amendment is the Social Security Preservation and Debt Reduction Act. It implements a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which we approved as part of the budget resolution just before our Easter recess. 
   As you know, that sense-of-the-Senate resolution passed this Chamber on March 24 by a vote of 99 to zero. It said simply that we ought to truly protect Social Security by seeing to it that moneys in the Social Security trust fund are only used to fix Social Security or to pay down the public debt, and for no other purpose. 
   We all agree that saving Social Security is our No. 1 priority in this Congress. That has been a discussion that virtually every Member at one time or another has been part of. The President, in both his 1998 and his 1999 State of the Union Addresses, said we should save every penny of the Social Security surplus. In this year's Address, he said we should use it to reduce the Federal debt so as to ensure it will not be squandered on other spending programs. 
   I agree with that. So do my cosponsors. Therefore, it is our hope, through this amendment we are offering today, to put into effect that which so many people, including the President, have sought to accomplish. If enacted into law, this amendment would save every penny of the Social Security surplus either to fix Social Security or to reduce the public debt. 
   Using hundreds of billions of dollars from the Social Security trust fund for new spending will not save Social Security. Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office now estimates that the President's own budget, the one he submitted to us in February, spends $158 billion of the Social Security surplus, 20 percent of the surplus that will be generated over the next 5 years. Fortunately, as you know, the Senate charted a different course. Through our sense-of-the-Senate resolution, 99 Senators stated our intention to lock up the Social Security trust fund to protect those dollars from being spent on other Government programs. 
   Let me recount what this resolution, which we passed as part of the budget, provided. 
   First, it provided we would place Social Security truly and fully off budget. 
   Second, we pledged to create a subcategory of the current gross Federal debt limit; namely, debt held by the public. 
   Third, we pledged to mandate the reduction of that publicly held debt level by an amount equal to the Social Security trust fund surplus. 
   In addition, the limits could be adjusted one time to accommodate substantive Social Security reform. In other words, unless we were using the Social Security trust fund surplus to fix Social Security, reform to modernize the Social Security system, then it would be used to reduce the current levels of 
   Publicly held debt. 
   The amendment I am offering would implement those pledges. So let me briefly run down its provisions. 
   The Social Security Surplus Preservation and Debt Reduction Act reaffirms that Social Security is off budget. That means its assets should not be counted for purposes of the budget submitted by the President or the Congressional Budget Resolution. The legislation establishes a simple majority point of order against any budget that does not count Social Security moneys. This amendment also codifies the budget resolution language to establish a 60-vote Senate point of order against any budget resolution, budget amendment, or budget conference report that runs a deficit unless that deficit results solely from Social Security reform legislation. 
   Of critical importance is the amendment's provision establishing in law a declining limit on the amount of debt that could be held by the public. This limit would be reduced in the year 2000, in the year 2001, and at 2-year intervals thereafter through the year 2009, by an amount equal to the entire Social Security trust fund surplus for each corresponding time period. The amount would be measured as CBO's current annual projections of the Social Security surplus for these same years. 
   The 60-vote point of order would lie against any resolution or bill that would exceed the publicly held debt limits. In other words, we could not expand the publicly held debt unless we had 60 Members of this Chamber who would make such a decision.  
   However, these limits would be automatically adjusted for the cost of Social Security reform, as I have mentioned, and/or for any changes in the actual or projected Social Security trust fund surpluses. 
   Clearly, we are trying to read out the long period of time through this legislation, a 10-year period. So if, as we move through that period, the size of the Social Security trust fund surplus were to be readjusted or projected differently, then the legislation we are offering right now would provide the mechanism for making adjustments in that reduction of the publicly held debt accordingly. 
   A number of additional provisions would protect Social Security recipients from unforeseen events. First, specific language in the amendment states that the Secretary of the Treasury shall give priority to the payment of Social Security benefits required to be paid by law. This amendment guarantees that Social Security benefits will have the highest priority on all Federal moneys. We institute a concrete guarantee to seniors, and to those who one day will be seniors, that their benefits are truly backed up by the full faith and credit of the Government of the United States. 
   In addition, Mr. President, this amendment includes a provision that would set aside the public debt reductions in the case of recession. Whenever the Commerce Department reports two consecutive quarters of less than 1 percent growth, the limits would be set aside until there is one full quarter of more than 1 percent real growth. Once reestablished, the limit would restart 6 months later at the level of public debt held at the time of the recession's ending and then step back down at the rate projected by the newly determined Social Security 
   surpluses. 
   Finally, this amendment includes an exception for emergencies such as the current crisis in Kosovo. 
   On March 17 of this year, Treasury Secretary Rubin sent a letter expressing several concerns about this approach. First, let me say that I was somewhat disappointed when he did so and surprised that he would raise the concerns about a bill that had not yet been written, let alone introduced. I appreciate the way Washington public policy debates work, Mr. President, and I understand the Secretary of the Treasury wanted to, at a very early stage, express concerns. What we have tried to do is respond to those concerns in such a fashion, I hope, that the way we have crafted the amendment will satisfy some of the issues raised in his correspondence. Let me talk about a few of those considerations at this time. 
   First, Secretary Rubin in his letter commented that fiscal restraint is best exercised through the tools of the budget process; debt limits should not be used as an additional means of imposing restraint. But the last 2 years have clearly shown that current budget rules are inadequate to curb Washington's spending habits. 
   Last year, the President threatened to shut down the Government unless we spent $21 billion of the Social Security surplus through various so-called ``emergency'' spending declarations. There was a lot of debate as to whether or not some of those provisions truly were appropriately described as emergencies. This year, as I noted, the President proposed spending $158 billion of the Social Security surplus on new spending programs over the next 5 years. 
   The budget rules, therefore, I do not believe are protecting the Social Security surplus, and it is not just the President who has proposed ideas and ways by which these Social Security surplus dollars can be spent. Members of Congress, on both sides of the aisle, have a lot of spending ideas, as we have heard. 
   In my judgment, the current budget rules do not protect these Social Security surplus dollars adequately. They are not designed for that purpose. Therefore, in my judgment, only by locking away the Social Security surplus and guaranteeing that the spenders cannot get ahold of it will we be able to protect those surplus dollars. 
   The fact of the matter is, if there is money available, people will find a way to spend it under the current rules. I think that is very simple and clear, and I think we should take additional steps to address it. I do not think we can count, as the Secretary has indicated, on the existing rules to suffice. 
   Next, Secretary Rubin has raised the specter of default saying:  
   Even the appearance of a risk that the United States of America might not meet its obligations because of the absence of necessary debt authority would impose significant additional costs on American taxpayers.  
   Mr. President, we should keep in mind that we currently have a debt ceiling of $5.95 trillion. We live within a debt ceiling. We are not talking about creating something out of whole cloth here, a limit on the amount of indebtedness the American Government can assume. That is the law, and the Treasury cannot issue more debt than that. 
   Further, current gross Federal debt is about $5.48 trillion. It is not at the moment projected to rise 
   significantly over the next 10 years. There is no specter of failure to meet our obligations here. 
   I will note, however, that the CBO estimated that the President's proposals in his budget would raise gross Federal debt to almost $8.4 trillion, almost $3.5 trillion over the current debt limit, exceeding the current debt limit by nearly 40 percent. Therefore, using the Secretary's logic, the President's budget will place us in immediate jeopardy of default because it will exceed the debt limits that we already have in place. 
   Our proposal, on the other hand, simply creates a sublimit of our current debt limit, one for debt held by the public. It does nothing to limit our ability to meet our obligations. 
   Nonetheless, we have tried to take Secretary Rubin's concerns seriously. What we have done to try to address those concerns--and I will elaborate on this a little bit further at a later point in these remarks--we have delayed the implementation of each year's new debt limit by 7 months to ensure that they become effective when the Treasury is most flush with cash. This will establish a buffer that is more than sufficient, in our judgment, to cover Treasury's short-term cash management needs, even during seasons of the year when cash deficits have historically appeared. 
   Third, Secretary Rubin has expressed concern that the publicly held debt limits ``could easily be inadequate for the Government to meet its obligations at a given point during the year. If the Treasury could not borrow or raise, it is possible that it could simply stop honoring any payment.'' And he even went on to say Social Security payments. 
   What he means by that, and it is related to the earlier point that I just addressed, is the fact that the revenue stream to the Government does not always coincide with the outflow of money during particular points in the year. That is why, as I have mentioned, we have altered our original proposal to move the date at which these publicly held debt ceiling changes would occur to a point--May 1--at which time, based on the past 10 years, the Government has been most flush, has had the largest inflow of money--obviously, it corresponds to some extent to tax payment day and other factors--for the exact purpose of making sure the changes would occur at a point when the Treasury would have the most cash on hand and the greatest flexibility with respect to any obligations, it would seem to me. 
   In addition, we have placed into this amendment a legal declaration that Social Security payments required by law have priority claims on the U.S. Treasury. In other words, we try to do two things here that I think address all of the concerns raised by Secretary Rubin. 
   First, we have changed the effective date as to when the debt limits would be changed to meet the maximum point of revenue stream to the Government, thus giving him and his successors total flexibility with respect to meeting obligations, and the guaranteed Social Security benefit checks will be paid by ensuring in the language of the amendment that they would receive top priority of expenditures. 
   In addition, we have responded to the Secretary's concern about short-term cash management swings, as I say, with a 7-month delay of implementation of the debt limits. 
   We are open to other ideas, but we are trying to be responsive to those  concerns that have been raised. That is our 
   hope here, to try to address anything that might serve as an impediment to anyone concerning the support of this vitally needed legislation. 
   In addition, Secretary Rubin has worried that the proposed debt limits could run the risk of worsening an economic downturn. We take that to mean concerns that if a recession were occurring, we would be in a difficult position to adequately address it. Once again, we have taken into account those concerns, and we have placed in our amendment language, as I mentioned earlier, that would suspend the debt limits during times of recession and reinstate them only after we have recovered from such recession at the newly adjusted publicly held debt levels. 
   Finally, the Secretary expressed concern that the lockbox does not allow for emergencies. Let me first observe that this administration's use of the term ``emergency'' has been somewhat variable, and it would certainly be the view of this Senator, and I know others, that it has been used to characterize a number of expenditures that are hard pressed to be included under that definition, at least as I see it. We spent $21 billion of the Social Security surplus on an emergency package at the end of the last Congress that certainly had provisions which did not, in my judgment, meet the normal definition of that term. 
   However, considering that we now have a 60-vote point of order against any nondefense emergency spending provisions as part of the budget resolution that we passed, we have placed in this amendment language to automatically adjust upwards the publicly held debt limits for any emergency spending provisions. Thus, we once again address the concern that was raised. 
   Mr. President, I believe this meets, therefore, every one of the serious concerns expressed by the Treasury Secretary, while at the same time still meeting the central goal of protecting and preserving the Social Security trust fund surpluses. It successfully addresses the No. 1 issue of this Congress: Saving and strengthening Social Security. 
   While it may not constitute the long-term reform proposals that I know will be further debated as the Congress moves ahead, it protects the surpluses of the trust fund so they can be employed to make sure that we modernize the Social Security system in a way that not only guarantees today's beneficiaries are able to receive what they are entitled to, but also the future beneficiaries will as well. We owe it to those who have reached retirement age, as well as those who will one day join them, to do this. 
   As recent events have shown, the only way to do that is to take Social Security finally and fully off budget, because so long as Social Security trust fund surpluses can be accessed by spending priorities, they will be spent. In my judgment, it is that simple. It is simply too easy to point to good ideas and 
   good programs and arguments of things that can be done with large amounts of the American people's money, too easy to see the benefits of Federal spending without looking at the cost to our financial stability and to those who depend on a sound Social Security system. 
   In my opinion, we must, in order to meet our obligations to the American people, see to it that every penny of the Social Security trust fund surplus is preserved for Social Security. And the only way to do that is to lock up those funds by using them to pay down the public debt. I think it is the right thing to do. 
   President Clinton himself has endorsed the idea at the root of this amendment. This Chamber recently voted unanimously for a resolution calling for legislation of this sort. So I hope we can get together, as colleagues, to take what would be the final step--this amendment--to place Social Security surpluses above the risks that they will be squandered and secure them for generations to come. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased, on behalf of a variety of colleagues, to offer this amendment. We look forward to the discussion. I hope that it can encompass not just a discussion of this proposal as offered, but if Members have ideas with respect to the lockbox, I hope they will share them with us, because I think protecting the Social Security surplus dollars is something that we have an obligation to achieve in this Congress. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President I rise to note the passing of a great Republican and a great American. Dr. Albert E. Bullock died on April 7 at the age of 72 at his home in Kensington, Maryland. He had been fighting cancer for some time. 
   Al, as he was known by everyone who knew him, was the husband of my able and dedicated office manager, Katja Bullock. He was also a dedicated dentist and a devoted Republican activist who lived life to the fullest and brought energy and humor to everything he did. 
   Born in Washington, Al served in the United States Navy during World War II and was awarded both the Victory Medal and the American Theatre Ribbon. When he was honorably discharged in 1946, Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal sent him a letter expressing ``the Navy's pride'' in his service. He became a life-long member of American Legion Post 268 in Wheaton, Maryland. 
   Al attended the University of Maryland and graduated from Georgetown University's School of Dentistry in 1952. He served as a Clinical Instructor at Georgetown immediately after graduating and published original scientific articles in the District of Columbia Dental Society Journal and the Southern California Journal of Orthodontics. He was elected to the National Dental Honor Fraternity and named a Fellow of the Royal Society of Health. 
   Al was an integral part of his community. He was particularly active and important in the Montgomery County Republican Party. And his positions in the party were numerous. He served twice as Montgomery County Republican Party Chairman and was a regular fixture on the County's Republican Central Committee between 1982 and 1994. 
   He also served as Executive Director of Maryland's Reagan for President Committee and as a member of Maryland's Electoral College. In 1994 he was the Republican nominee for Maryland State Senate. 
   During the Reagan Administration Al served on the National Advisory Council on Child Nutrition and the National Advisory Committee on the National Health Service Corps. 
   But it was perhaps as a mentor to young conservatives that Al had his greatest effect on politics. Literally dozens of Washington interns at one time or another stayed with the Bullocks or attended one of the many events hosted at their home. Across America today, there are many active Republicans who were strengthened in their convictions by Al and Katja Bullock. 
   Indeed, many of us believe there is a political dynasty forming in the Bullock family. Al would allow himself to be put up for elective office in heavily Democratic Montgomery Country because no one else wanted the task of losing. But he must have had some effect because his son, also named Al, made a respectable showing in his own run for public office. And everyone agrees that Al's grandson, Al the third, who at a quite tender age was already defending his grandfather on the stump, could just be the one to turn Montgomery County Republican. 
   Al Bullock knew how important it is to keep active in political life. But he also knew that politics is not all of life. He was a strong family man as well as a dedicated professional who took great pride in his work and in this relations with his patients. He also was active as a member of the American Light Opera Company, serving on its Board of Trustees and as Chairman in 1965. 
   The story goes, in fact, that Katja fell in love with Al when, seeing him for an emergency dental procedure, she was soothed by the strains of opera as Al worked on her teeth. 
   I will always remember Al's winning combination of humor and dedication to conservative principles. He led a full and colorful life, in which he met many of the great public figures of our age. It was a great honor for anyone in public life to make it to the photographic hall of fame lining the Bullock family's front stairs. I was happy to see last Christmas that my own photo had made it to one corner of that hallway, overshadowed by pictures of more than one President. 
   My heartfelt condolences go to Katja, Al's son Albert, his daughter-in-law Katie and grandsons Albert and Seamus, as well as his sister, Betty Sorrell. 
   Al will be sorely missed by everyone lucky enough to know him. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I wish to express my appreciation to Senator LOTT for bringing forward this unanimous consent agreement to discharge an important piece of legislation from the Banking Committee. 
   I also thank the original cosponsors of this bill, Senators SESSIONS, LEVIN, KENNEDY and HARKIN for their support, along with 74 other colleagues who have cosponsored this bill. 
   Our intent is to honor one of the most important figures in the American civil rights movement, Rosa Parks. This legislation would honor Mrs. Parks with a Congressional gold medal in recognition of her immense contributions to our nation over a lifetime committed to furthering civil rights in our nation. 
   Rosa Louise McCauley was born in Tuskegee, Alabama in 1913. At age 2 she moved to her grandparents' farm in Pine Level, Alabama with her mother, Leona McCauley, and younger brother, Sylvester. Her mother, a school teacher, taught her at home until, at age 11, she enrolled in the Montgomery Industrial School for Girls. 
   The young Miss McCauley cleaned classrooms to pay her tuition, then moved on to attend Booker T. Washington High School. She was forced to leave that school to take care of her sick mother. 
   In 1932 she married Raymond Parks. Mr. Parks, who was largely self-taught, supported his wife, Rosa's, desire to finish high school and to attend Alabama State College, which she did. 
   The couple settled in Montgomery, Alabama, where they were active in the local chapter of the NAACP and the Montgomery Voters League. 
   Mrs. Parks worked to register African American voters and to fight the violence and injustice visited upon them under segregation. 
   As Mrs. Parks put it, ``There were cases of flogging, peonage, murder, and rape.'' During this time the NAACP ``didn't seem to have too many successes. It was more a matter of trying to challenge the powers that be, and to let it be known that we did not wish to continue being second-class citizens.'' 
   Rosa Parks issued that challenge to the powers that be. And her brave act helped bring down the system of segregation in this country. 
   The story has been told many times of how Mrs. Parks, employed as a seamstress in a local department store, boarded a Montgomery city bus on December 1, 1955. After a few stops, a number of white people got on the bus--too many to fit into the seats in the ``whites only'' section. Seeing a white man standing on his bus, the driver ordered Mrs. Parks and three other African Americans to give up their seats to him. 
   The other three people moved, but Rosa Parks had had enough. As she reflected later, ``I kept thinking about my mother and my grandparents, and how strong they were. I knew there was a possibility of being mistreated, but an opportunity was being given to me to do what I had asked of others.'' 
   Mrs. Parks showed her strength by refusing to give up her seat. She was arrested, she was taken to jail and four days later she was convicted of disorderly conduct. Her crime? Refusing to be treated as a second class citizen. 
   Even before this unjust conviction was handed down, indeed, the very day after Mrs. Parks' arrest, the response, born of righteous indignation, had begun. Mrs. Parks had set in motion events that would change the face of the United States forever. 
   On December 2, the Women's Political Council distributed fliers throughout the community encouraging African Americans to boycott the Montgomery bus system on the day of Mrs. Parks' trial. 
   A meeting was held at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, whose pastor was the Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, jr. This meeting, held to plan the boycott, included the reverend Ralph Abernathy, Reverend King and Jo Ann Robinson of the Women's Political Council. 
   The boycott was an astounding success, and on the day of Mrs. Parks' trial the Montgomery Improvement Association was formed with Dr. King as spokesman and president. 
   The Montgomery Improvement Association took over management of the bus boycott, which was to last 381 days, and filed suit on behalf of those against whom the bus company had discriminated. 
   In the face of widespread harassment, threats and even bombs, the brave people of the Montgomery Improvement Association, along with their supporters, kept up their boycott while their case made its way through the courts. 
   Finally, on November 13, 1956, the Supreme Court held Montgomery's bus segregation unconstitutional. After a brief period of defiance the segregationists gave in, and the boycott ended. 
   Of course this was far from the end of the battle for civil rights in America. But it was an important event, spurring the civil rights movement to further action. 
   Through marches, boycotts, civil disobedience and the power of their principles, members of the civil rights movement broke down the barriers of legal discrimination and established equality before the law as a reality for all Americans. 
   Rosa Parks set these historic events in motion. Because of her faith, perseverance and quiet dignity, all Americans have been freed from the moral stain of segregation. 
   But Rosa Parks paid a price for her principles. She was arrested. She lost her job. She could not find work. And she was constantly harassed. 
   Fortunately for my state of Michigan, Mrs. Parks' bother, Sylvester, had resettled in Detroit, and the Parks family joined him there in 1957. 
   For over 40 years now, Michigan has been a particular beneficiary of Mrs. Parks' work on behalf of civil rights and her efforts to educate young people in particular. 
   And this mother of the civil rights movement, as she is known throughout our nation, continues to be active in the struggle for equality and the empowerment of the disenfranchised. 
   In 1965 she joined the staff of U.S. Representative JOHN CONYERS, where she worked until her retirement in 1988. 
   After the death of her husband in 1987 she founded the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development. 
   This non-profit organization helps young people achieve their full potential. Over 5,000 young people have participated in the Institute's ``Pathways to Freedom'' tour, which traces parts of the Underground Railroad along which escaped slaves traveled to safety. The Institute also runs local programs offering summer school, tutoring programs and life-skills classes. 
   Ms. Parks has received many awards in recognition of her efforts for racial harmony, including the Springarn Award, the NAACP's highest honor for civil rights contributions, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian honor, and the first International Freedom Conductor Award from the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center. 
   Throughout her long life, Rosa Parks has shown that one woman can make a real difference. She has shown all of us the power of conviction and quiet dignity in pursuit of justice and empowerment. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting legislation to bestow upon her the Congressional gold medal she so well deserves. 
   Madam President, I was thinking about Rosa Parks as I came to the floor today. I remembered an incident that I briefly mentioned when we introduced this legislation, an incident of my own. It was the first I had heard of Rosa Parks, although her name wasn't specifically mentioned, or at least it did not register at the time. As an elementary schoolchild, probably around, I would guess, in 1962, 1963--somewhere in the second, third, fourth grade--I remember the teacher in my classroom talking about this incident, this  woman who would not move to the back of the bus, explaining it to us as one explains things to children who do not necessarily know history as well as they should at that age, explaining what it meant and why it had been so important. 
   I was thinking about that today because I recognized at that moment I, as a second-grade student, first realized that everybody in the country was not always treated the same way. That is how that incident, Rosa Parks' contribution, touched my life. Later, obviously, as I moved along in school, I read more and watched the news a little and began to realize the magnitude of the civil rights struggle we as a nation had addressed, and so much of it was based on this event which Rosa Parks prompted in 1955. 
   So, while all of us, I suppose, can see this in its national consequence, I am sure all of us, too, probably, have a more personal connection as well. That is mine. It is also, first, a connection that I share with my colleague from Michigan, who is about to speak on this as well. That is the connection of pride that we have that Rosa Parks is a Michiganian. 
   While she may have been born and lived much of her life in another part of the country, we are awfully proud of the fact that most of the last 40 years she has lived in our State. 
   Madam President, if you look at the list of those who have been recipients of congressional gold medals, most recently President and Mrs. Gerald Ford and such other honorees as Mother Teresa and the Little Rock Nine, Billy and Ruth Graham, it seems only fitting that Congress should now pass this legislation and add Rosa Parks to this list of Americans who have made such great contributions.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise for the second year in a row as an original co-sponsor of legislation increasing the authorization for the Small Business Administration women's business center program. These centers provide important management, marketing, and financial advice to women-owned small businesses. 
   Mr. President, this program finances a number of very important initiatives at the state and local levels; measures that have proven crucial to women struggling to enter the job world and to start their own businesses. These initiatives have changed the lives of a significant number of women in Michigan and throughout the United States. 
   For example, two women's business centers in Michigan are leading the way toward preparing and advancing women in the business field. Ann Arbor's Women's Initiative for Self-Employment, or WISE, program provides low-income women with the tools and resources they need to begin and expand businesses. The WISE program also provides a comprehensive package of business training, personal development workshops, credit counseling, start-up and expansion financing, business counseling and mentoring. In addition, Grand Rapids' Opportunities for Women, or GROW, provides career counseling and training for women in western Michigan. GROW provides essential job preparedness with basic business training and assistance in obtaining more specialized instruction. 
   Mr. President, I salute the good people at WISE and GROW for their hard work in helping the women of Michigan. These programs create and expand business opportunities, fight against poverty, increase incomes, stabilize families, develop skills, and spark community renewal. If we are to maintain and increase revitalization of troubled areas and the empowerment of women we must continue to provide targeted funding for these types of assistance programs. 
   For these reasons, I support the Women's Business Centers Sustainability Act of 1999. Because the Small Business Administration's women's business centers program makes it possible for women to build productive lives for themselves and their families, I believe it deserves the increased funding it needs to expand its services. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President. I rise today to honor the men's basketball team of Cornerstone College in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and their coach, Kim Elders. This outstanding team recently reached the pinnacle of success by winning the NAIA Division II National Championship for basketball last month. 
   The Golden Eagles of Cornerstone have received an honor that is reserved for only one team each year. This achievement is the product of hard work, determination, and dedication which was present throughout the Golden Eagles' season. The common focus of the team members was determined early in the pre-season as they declared themselves to be On A Mission.'' Throughout the regular season and continuing into the playoffs, Cornerstone subdued their opponents amassing an amazing record of 37 wins and only three losses, thereby earning the #1 rank in the national polls. At the national tournament in Nampa, Idaho, they proved that they deserved that rank by defeating all challengers. Their exciting season peaked at the championship game, in which Cornerstone beat the two-time defending national champion, Bethel, in an exciting overtime final. 
   The achievements of the basketball team will be seen by many as a way to promote the glory of sport and the excellence of Cornerstone in particular. Interestingly however, these aspects are not the focus at Cornerstone College. Rather, Cornerstone has followed its motto of Academic Excellence, Christian Commitment,'' by using basketball and their team's success as a medium to bring the Christian message to others. This being the case, the men's basketball team has not only brought a sense of pride to Cornerstone College and the greater community, but their success has been a platform for bringing the hope of Christ to all who hear about their championship. 
   Mr. President, the men's basketball team of Cornerstone College has shown itself to be a group of unique and talented individuals. I commend them for their dedication and hard work and honor them for the success that it has brought them. Furthermore, I commend Cornerstone College for its unique and important message and for their faithfulness in making it heard. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the men's basketball team of Cornerstone College for their success in becoming the 1999 NAIA national champions.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators FITZGERALD, MOYNIHAN, and SCHUMER in introducing this important legislation, which would prevent the federal government from taxing away any monies obtained by Holocaust survivors or their families in a settlement related to thefts by the Nazis or their sympathizers. 
   The horrors of the Nazi regime and its atrocities remain very much with us. Many people in America and around the world, particularly Jews, must live every day with memories of atrocities suffered or witnessed, either by themselves or by those they love, during the Nazi terror. Ghettoes, death camps and simple murder were the stuff of daily life for millions of innocent people during this terrible time of Nazi power. 
   Only recently has public attention been properly directed toward another great crime of the Nazi regime and those who cooperated with it: A 1998 study by the Institute of the World Jewish Congress estimates that between $90 billion and $140 billion in today's dollars was stolen from the Jewish populations of countries occupied by the Nazis. In addition to committing outright theft and looting, the Nazis seized liquid assets that could be converted easily into cash, such as insurance policy proceeds and bank accounts. Documents discovered by Risk International Services, Inc., an insurance archaeology firm, show that the Nazis specifically targeted insurance policies held by Jews as a source of  funding for their expansionist, totalitarian regime. 
   Some insurance companies also specifically (and illegally) targeted Jewish families. Knowing that Jewish policy holders soon would be taken to concentration camps, these firms sold specifically tailored policies, taking as much cash as possible up front, with no intention of honoring their obligations. 
   After the war, Holocaust survivors attempted to collect on their policies, access their bank accounts and/or reclaim assets that had been illegally seized. Unfortunately, governments, banks and insurance companies failed to fulfill their duty to treat Holocaust victims with justice and dignity. Instead, Mr. President, they refused to honor policies or return stolen assets. In this way they compounded crime with crime and denied people who already had suffered more than most of us could bear the rightful means by which to rebuild their lives. 
   Finally, after over 50 years of injustice, Holocaust survivors and their families are reclaiming what is rightfully theirs. But, even as we support these efforts to reclaim stolen property, I believe we must do our part in protecting the proceeds. Under current law, any money received by Holocaust survivors in their settlements with banks and other organizations that once cooperated with the Nazis would be treated as gross income for federal tax purposes. 
   Mr. President, I firmly believe that victims of the Holocaust have suffered far too much for any such taxation to be just. These settlements represent but a fraction of what is owed to those who suffered under Nazi tyranny. To treat them as income subject to taxation would be wrong. 
   This is why this legislation is so important. It will prevent the federal government from taxing away any monies obtained by Holocaust survivors or their families in a settlement related to thefts by the Nazis or their sympathizers. It will prevent yet another injustice from being done to those who survived the brutal Nazi regime. It will also keep our nation firmly on the side of justice.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Stanley J. Cherry, a World War I veteran and extraordinary citizen of Grand Traverse County, Michigan, who was recently awarded France's highest tribute, the Legion of Honor. 
   A son of Polish immigrants, Stanley Cherry enlisted in the United States Army in May 1918, after which time he was sent to England with the 330th Second Machine Company Battalion where he was trained to operate English Vickers, French Hodgkiss, and American Browning machine guns. He began his service in France in October of the same year where he remained after the signing of the armistice, assigned to secure provisions. 
   During his 62 year marriage to his wife Lucille, the couple owned and operated a general store in Elmira, Michigan, for over 30 years. In addition to running the store they raised two daughters, Joanne Hawly and Jeanette Galbraith, who both currently live in Traverse City, Michigan. 
   In commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the signing of the armistice, the French government chose to honor surviving allied war veterans who fought in France to help defeat the German Army. A representative of the French Consulate General office in Chicago was present at the February 19th ceremony to confer upon Mr. Cherry the rank of Chevalier of the National Order of the Legion of Honor. France's highest honor, the Legion of Honor was founded in 1802 by Napoleon as a way of recognizing citizens for their contributions to France. 
   In addition to the Legion of Honor award, Mr. Cherry was presented a certificate of merit voted by the Michigan Legislature and signed by Governor Engler. 
   Mr. President, Stanley Cherry is an outstanding American citizen. In April he will be celebrating his 103rd birthday. I salute him for his many remarkable contributions as a veteran and for his commitment to his community and family. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring him on being conferred the rank of Chevalier of the Legion of Honor.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today the Senate again will pass legislation to protect the habitat of the broad range of migratory birds which spend the spring and summer months in the United States. This legislation, which I introduced with my distinguished colleagues, Senator DASCHLE and Senator CHAFEE, is designed to protect over 90 endangered species of bird spending certain seasons in the United States and other seasons in other nations of the West Hemisphere. This is actually the second time this legislation has passed the Senate. Last year, after receiving considerable support from the environmental and conservation communities, this legislation passed the Senate by Unanimous consent. Unfortunately, time ran out for equal consideration in the House. Nevertheless, this year we returned with renewed determination and were able to again move this bill. 
   Every year, Mr. President, approximately 25 million Americans travel to observe birds, and 60 million American adults watch and feed birds at home. Bird-watching is a source of great pleasure to many Americans, as well as a source of important revenue to states, like my own state of Michigan, which attract tourists to their scenes of natural beauty. Bird watching and feeding generates fully $20 billion every Year in revenue across America. 
   Birdwatching is a popular activity in Michigan, and its increased popularity is reflected by an increase in tourist dollars being spent in small, rural communities. Healthy bird populations also prevent hundreds of millions of dollars in economic losses each year to farming and timber interests. They help control insect populations, thereby preventing crop failures and infestations. 
   Despite the enormous benefits we derive from our bird populations, many of them are struggling to survive. Ninety species are listed as endangered or threatened in the United States. Another 124 species are of high conservation concern. In my own state we are working to bring the Kirtland's Warbler back from the brink of extinction. A few years ago, the population of this distinctive bird has been estimated at approximately 200 nesting pairs. Since then, a great deal of work has been done by Michigan DNR employees to preserve the Kirtland's Warbler habitat in the Bahamas, where they winter. Thanks in large part to this effort, the number of breeding pairs has recently increased to an estimated 800. This is an easily grasped problem. Since the entire species spends half of the year in the Bahamas, the significant efforts made by Michigan's Department of Natural Resources and concerned residents in Michigan will not be enough to save this bird if its winter habitat is degraded or destroyed. 
   This situation is not unique, among bird watchers' favorites, many neotropical birds are endangered or of high conservation concern. And several of the most popular neotropical species, including bluebirds, robins, goldfinches, and orioles, migrate to and from the Caribbean and Latin America. 
   Because neotropical migratory birds range across a number of international borders every year, we must work to establish safeguards at both ends of their migration routes, as well as at critical stopover areas along their way. Only in this 
   way can conservation efforts prove successful. 
   That is why Senator DASCHLE, Senator CHAFEE and I introduced the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act. This legislation will protect bird habitats across international boundaries by establishing partnerships between the business community, nongovernmental organizations and foreign nations. By teaming businesses with international organizations concerned to protect the environment we can combine capital with know-how. By partnering these entities with local organizations in countries where bird habitat is endangered we can see to it that local people receive the training they need to preserve this habitat and maintain this critical natural resource. 
   This act establishes a 4-year demonstration project providing $8 million each year to help establish programs in the United States, Latin America, and the Caribbean. The greater portion of these funds will be focused outside the U.S. Approved programs will manage and conserve neotropical migratory bird populations. Those eligible to participate will include national and international nongovernmental organizations and business interests, as well as U.S. Government entities. 
   The key to this act is cooperation among nongovernmental organizations. The federal share of each project's cost is never to exceed 33 percent. For grants awarded outside the United States, the non-Federal match can be made with in-kind contributions. This will encourage volunteerism and local interest in communities that lack the financial resources to contribute currency. Since domestic organizations and communities are more financially secure, the matching portion of grants awarded within the United States will be required in cash. 
   The approach taken by this legislation differs from that of current programs in that it is proactive and, by avoiding a crisis management approach, will prove significantly more cost effective. In addition, this legislation does not call for complicated and expensive bureaucratic structures such as councils, commissions or multi-tiered oversight structures. Further, this legislation will bring needed attention and expertise to areas now receiving relatively little attention in the area of environmental degradation. 
   This legislation has the support of the National Audubon Society, the Nature Conservancy, the American Bird Conservancy, Defenders of Wildlife, the Ornithological Council, Ducks Unlimited, and the American Forest and Paper Association. These organizations agree with Senator DASCHLE, Senator CHAFEE, and I that, by establishing partnerships between business, government and nongovernmental organizations both here and abroad we can greatly enhance the protection of migratory bird habitat. 
   I want to take a moment to comment on the contributions of Senator DASCHLE and Senator CHAFEE with respect to this bill. For over a year, my colleagues and their staffs have dedicated a great deal of time and hard work to this legislation. This bill would not have advanced as it has, perhaps would not have moved at all, were it not for their efforts, and I wish to thank them for all they have done. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Millennium Digital Commerce Act, a bill to promote the use of electronic authentication technologies and enhance the Internet's capacity to serve as a business tool. I am joined in introducing this bill by Senator JOHN MCCAIN, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, Senator RON WYDEN, and Senator CONRAD BURNS. This legislation builds on the Government Paperwork Elimination Act, a bill I sponsored to promote the use of electronic signatures by the Federal Government, which was signed into law by the President as part of the Omnibus Appropriations Act. 
   The Internet has experienced almost exponential growth since its inception. Where once the Internet was a medium limited to the sharing of ideas between scientists and educators, it is now a tool which allows every person with a computer to access more information than is contained in any single library, communicate with friends for a fraction of the cost of phone service, or purchase goods from retailers located all over the world. Electronic commerce is clearly booming. But in order to realize its full potential, we must enact Federal and State legislation to enable, enhance, and protect the next generation of Internet usage. 
   The Internet is poised to serve as an efficient new tool for companies to transact business as never before. The development of electronic signature technologies now allow organizations to enter into contractual arrangements without ever having to drive across town or fly thousands of miles to personally meet with a client or potential business partner. The Internet is prepared to go far beyond the ability to buy a book or order apparel on-line. It is ready to lead a revolution in the execution of business transactions which may involve thousands or millions of dollars in products or services; transactions so important they require that both parties enter into a legally binding contract. 
   This capability is provided by the development of secure electronic authentication methods and technologies. These technologies permit an individual to positively identify the person with whom they are transacting business and to ensure that information being shared by the parties has not been tampered with or modified without the knowledge of both parties. While such technologies are seeing limited use today, the growth of the application has out-paced government's ability to appropriately modify the legal framework governing the use of electronic signatures and other authentication methods. 
   Mr. President, the Millennium Digital Commerce Act is designed to promote the use of electronic signatures in business transactions and contracts. At present, the greatest barrier to such transactions is the lack of a consistent and predictable national framework of rules governing the use of electronic signatures. Over forty States have enacted electronic authentication laws, and no two laws are the same. This inconsistency deters businesses from fully utilizing electronic signature technologies for contracts and other business transactions. The differences in our State laws create uncertainty about the effectiveness or legality of an electronic contract signed with an electronic signature. Of course, certainty is the basis for commerce, and contracts provide that certainty. Parties enter into contracts understanding that they will be bound by the terms of the agreement. However, the fear is that a business located in a State with different electronic authentication rules may be able to escape contractual obligations agreed to through electronic signatures. This legal uncertainty limits the potential of electronic commerce, and, thus, our nation's economic growth. 
   The needs for uniformity in electronic authentication rules is not only recognized by the business community,  but by the States as well. For the past two years, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Law, an organization comprised of e-commerce experts form the States, has been working to develop a uniform system for the use of electronic signatures for all fifty States. Their product, the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, or UETA, is in the final stages of review and the drafters expect to have the Act completed by October. Assuming the UETA is finished as scheduled, and I believe it will be, it will then fall on each State 
   legislature to enact the legislation and establish the uniformity necessary for the interstate use of electronic signatures. 
   But agreement on the final language of the UETA proposal is not the same as enactment. Uniformity will not occur until all fifty States actually enact the UETA. Because some State legislatures are not in session next year and other States have more pressing legislative items, it could take three to four years for forty-five or fifty States to enact the UETA. With the rapid State of development in the high-technology sector, four years is an eternity. 
   The Digital Millennium Commerce Act is an interim measure to provide relief until the States adopt the provisions of the UETA. It will provide companies the baseline they need until a national baseline governing the use of electronic authentication exists at the State level. 
   First, the legislation provides that the electronic records produced in the execution of a digital contract shall not be denied legal effect solely because they are electronic in nature. This provision assures that a company will be able to rely on an electronic contract and that another party will not be able to escape their contractual obligations simply because the contract was entered into the Internet or any other computer network. By granting such certainty, this bill will reduce the likelihood of dissatisfied parties attempting to escape electronic contractual agreements and transactions. 
   Mr. President, let me stress that this Federal preemption of State law is designed to be an interim measure. It provides relief until the States enact uniform standards which are consistent with those contained in the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act and this legislation. Simply put, once States enact the UETA or other legislation governing the use of electronic signatures which is consistent to the UETA, the Federal preemption is lifted. 
   I consider myself a Federalist. I believe strongly in States rights and view with great caution proposals which call for the preemption of State law. After considerable study, it is my option that the need for a national baseline for the use of electronic signatures justifies a temporary, Federal action until such time as the States can enact a uniform standard. 
   Second, the bill grants parties to a transaction the freedom to determine the technologies and business methods to be used in the execution of an electronic contract. In essence, this assures that the Federal baseline will extend to the various aspects of State law governing authentication including such matters as registration and certification requirements, liability allocations, maintenance of revocation lists, payment of fees and other legal and regulatory concerns. 
   Third, this legislation sets forth the principles for the international use of electronic signatures. In the last year, U.S. negotiators have been meeting with the European Commissioners to discuss electronic signatures in international commerce. In these negotiations, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the States Department have worked in support of an open system governing the use of authentication technologies. Some European nations oppose this concept. For example, Germany insists that electronic transactions involving a German company must utilize a German electronic signature application. I applaud the Administration for their steadfast opposition to that approach. In an effort to bolster and strengthen the U.S. position in these international negotiations, this legislation lays out a serious of principles to govern the use of electronic signatures in international transactions. These principles included the following: 
   One, paper-based obstacles to electronic transactions must be eliminated. 
   Two, parties to an electronic transaction should choose the electronic authentication technology. 
   Third, parties to a transaction should have the opportunity to prove in court that their authentication approach and transactions are valid. 
   Fourth, the international approach to electronic signatures should take a nondiscriminatory approach to electronic signature. This will allow the free 
   market--not a government--to determine the type of authentication technologies used in international commerce. 
   Mr. President, these principles will bolster the U.S. convention that the Departments of State and Commerce are advocating abroad, and, hopefully, increase the likelihood of an open, market-based international framework to electronic commerce. 
   Finally, the bill directs the Department of Commerce and Office of Management and Budget to report on Federal laws and regulations that might pose barriers to e-commerce and report back to Congress on the impact of such provisions and provide suggestions for reform. 
   Mr. President, as with any legislation seeking to affect both Federal and State law, drafting this bill has been a challenging balancing act. During the drafting process, my office has received invaluable support from the Technology Division of the State of Massachusetts. Governor Paul Cellucci's staff have provided indispensable counsel on existing State law governing the use of electronic signatures and the manner in which Federal law can bolster or hamstring State contract law. Of course, the business and technology sectors have also been crucial in helping to craft this bill. Representatives from the Information Technology Association of America, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard and the National Association of Manufacturers have each lent their time and expertise to this effort. I appreciate their contributions and look forward to continuing this effort to ensure that we develop the best approach possible to promote use of electronic signatures in business transactions. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Millennium Digital Commerce Act. Mr. President, I ask that the text of this legislation be placed in the RECORD.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am joined today by Senators CRAPO, SANTORUM, HAGEL, INHOFE and COLLINS in introducing a sense of the Senate amendment to the budget resolution rejecting the President's proposed tax, as part of his fiscal year 2000 budget proposal, on the investment income earned by nonprofit trade associations and professional societies. 
   This proposal would tax any income in excess of $10,000 earned through the non-competitive activities of nonprofit associations, such as interest, dividends, capital gains, rents and royalties, posing a tremendous burden on an estimated 70,000 registered trade associations and professional societies. 
   Mostly operating on a state and local level, these organizations depend on this income to perform such vital community services as education, training, standard setting, industry safety, and community outreach. Faced with an additional increase in taxes of $1.4 billion over the next five years, many associations will be forced to cut back or eliminate these important services, forcing the government to step in, increasing expenditures and creating additional programs. 
   During a time when the government is projecting on-budget surpluses of more than $800 billion over the next 10 years, it is unconscionable that we would allow the administration to levy a new tax on these nonprofit organizations.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am joined today by Senators COVERDELL, ASHCROFT, and HUTCHINSON in introducing a sense of the Senate amendment to the budget resolution rejecting the use of federal funds for needle exchange programs. 
   Deaths resulting from drug overdoses have increased five times since 1988. According to Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Weekly, the number of American teenagers using heroin, once considered a drug used primarily by hard-core drug addicts, has doubled in the past five years. 
   Last year, the Clinton administration attempted to lift the ongoing ban on federal funds for needle exchange programs as a solution to reducing the rate HIV infection among intravenous (IV) drug use without increasing the use of drugs like heroin. Needle exchange programs are not the answer--giving an addict a clean needle is equivalent to giving an alcoholic a clean glass--both do a more sanitary job of delivering the poison that is killing our kids.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am joined today by Senator CRAPO in offering a Sense of the Senate amendment rejecting a new tax proposed by the Clinton Administration. I am very pleased that this amendment has been cleared on both sides of the aisle and will be accepted by the full United States Senate. This unanimous voice vote for the Abraham-Crapo amendment demonstrates beyond shadow of a doubt that this association tax increase proposal is dead on arrival here in the United States Senate. 
   As part of the Administration's fiscal year 2000 budget proposal, this tax would be levied on the investment income earned by non-profit trade associations and professional societies. This proposal, which would tax any income earned through interest, dividends, capital gains, rents and royalties in excess of $10,000, imposes a tremendous burden on thousands of small and mid-sized trade associations and professional societies currently exempt under 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
   The Administration would like us to believe that this tax is targeted to a few large associations, affecting only those ``lobbying organizations'' which exist as tax shelters for members and to further the goals of special interests. Mr. President, nothing could be further from the truth. 
   This new tax would affect an estimated 70,000 registered trade associations and professional societies. The bulk of these associations operate at a state and local level, many of whom perform little, if any, lobbying function. In fact, associations rely on investment income to perform such vital services as education, training, standard setting, industry safety, research and statistical data, and community outreach. Through association organized volunteer programs, Americans contribute more than 173 million volunteer hours per year, at a value estimated at over $2 billion annually. 
   These organizations already contribute millions in taxes for any activities which place them in competition with for-profit businesses. Yet the Administration would like to impose a new tax on income earned outside of the competitive business environment, income which is used to fund functions serving the public welfare. Unlike for-profit corporations, investment income does not go to shareholders, individuals, or other companies. Associations do not have the liberty of simply raising prices, as do ordinary corporations, to cover increased costs. 
   Mr. President, faced with an additional increase in taxes of $1.44 billion over the next five years, many trade associations will be forced to cut back on important services, and some may not survive an economic downturn without the small cushion their investments provide. Without such services provided by associations, the government will be forced to step in, increasing expenditures and creating additional government programs and departments. 
   During a time when the government is projecting on-budget tax surpluses of more than $800 billion over the next 10 years, it is unconscionable that we allow the Administration to levy a new tax on these non-profit organizations. 
   Mr. President, in summary, the unanimous vote puts the entire Senate on record as rejecting this misguided tax increase on trade associations. Should this association tax proposal surface as a part of--or as an amendment to--tax reduction legislation reported by the Senate Finance Committee later this year, I will fight to ensure that the Senate adheres to the vote that we have taken today expressing the Sense of the Senate that it ought to be rejected outright.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Border Improvement and Immigration Act of 1999. I would like to express my thanks to Senators KENNEDY, GRAMS, LEAHY, GRAHAM, BURNS, MCCAIN, SNOWE, DEWINE, JEFFORDS, GORTON, CRAIG, LEVIN, SCHUMER, MURRAY, MURKOWSKI, MOYNIHAN, MACK, SMITH (OR), DORGAN, SANTORUM, COCHRAN, and INOUYE for being original cosponsors of this legislation. The legislation will correct an unfortunate provision--Section 110 of the 1996 Immigration Act. In correcting this provision, this legislation will prevent the Immigration and Naturalization Service from effectively shutting down our borders to trade and tourism. The legislation has wide support and appeal and is endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers, American Trucking Association, American Hotel and Motel Association, Travel Industry Association of America, Border Trade Alliance, American Association of Exporters and Importers, National Automobile Transporters Association, Fresh Produce Association of the Americas, American Association of Port Authorities, International Mass Retail Association, American Immigration Lawyers Association, International Warehouse Logistics Association, National Tour Association, Passenger Vessel Association and the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. 
   As a number of my colleagues are aware, Mr. President, in 1996 both the House and the Senate versions of the omnibus immigration bill contained differing provisions requiring collection of data on those entering and exiting the United States at certain airports. In conference, without any debate, a mandatory entry-exit system to capture the records of ``every alien'' was added to that legislation. 
   Representative SMITH and Senator Simpson, chairmen of the respective House and Senate Subcommittees responsible for 1996 legislation, have both agreed in an exchange of letters with the Canadian Ambassador that this provision, ``Section 110'' of the bill, was not intended to cover, for example, Canadians at the northern border. However, because of the term ``every alien,'' the INS has interpreted the law to require this program be implemented at all land borders, in addition to air and sea ports of entry. To the credit of the INS, it concedes that it cannot implement such a system. 
   Put simply, Mr. President, Section 110 is a mistake, and we must correct it. Failure to do so will cost American jobs. It will effectively close our borders to honest trade and tourism while harming our efforts to fight drugs, terrorism and illegal aliens. It must be eliminated. 
   We risk a great deal if we fail to act, Mr. President. Last year alone, exports to Canada generated more that 72,000 jobs in key manufacturing industries and more than $4.68 billion in value added for the state of Michigan alone. Our trade with Canada is the most extensive and profitable in the world. And last year more than 116 million people entered the United States by land from Canada. 
   The extent of our trade with Canada has caused us to develop an intricate web of interdependence that requires a substantially open border. With ``just in time'' delivery becoming the norm in our automobile assembly lines and throughout our manufacturing sector, a delivery of parts delayed by as little as 20 minutes can cause expensive assembly line shutdowns which our economy can ill afford. 
   But delay is exactly what we will see if Section 110 is not eliminated. Dan Stamper, 
   President of the Detroit International Bridge Company, has testified that even a very efficient system, say one taking 30 seconds for each person to be recorded entering or leaving the country, would mean enormous delays. More than 30,000 crossings per day take place at Detroit's Ambassador Bridge. Even if we say that 7,500 Canadians cross each day, that means 2,250 minutes of additional processing time. But there are only 1,440 minutes in a day. Traffic would be backed up literally for miles. Significant problems would be experienced on the Southern border as well. 
   Assembly lines will shut down. Tourists will stay home. Americans will lose jobs. 
   And for what? Nothing the American people want. The two pilot programs set up by the INS to test implementation of Section 110, one in Texas and one in upstate New York, were both shut down due to fierce community opposition. 
   Moreover, time and manpower diverted to Section 110's impossible directive will take away from efforts to deal with other problems facing the INS and the Customs service--problems like drug interdiction, the fight against terrorism, and the fight against illegal immigration. Drugs, terrorism and illegal immigration are real problems requiring a real investment on our part. We can't afford to undermine these programs to pursue a policy we know is nothing more than a mistake. 
   This legislation would eliminate the mandated automated entry-exit system at land and sea ports of entries and replace it with a feasibility study, required within one year of the passage of the bill, to examine whether any system could ever be developed and at an acceptable cost to American taxpayers, employers, employees, and the nation as a whole. 
   The bill would also authorize significant additional resources at the Northern and Southern borders to fight drugs and terrorism, and to facilitate the entry of legitimate trade and commerce. The legislation authorizes for fiscal year 2000 and 2001 a net increase of 535 INS inspectors for the Southwest land border and 375 inspectors for the Northern land border, in order to open all primary lanes on the Southwest and Northern borders during peak hours and enhance investigative resources. It would add 100 canine enforcement vehicles to be used by INS for inspection and enforcement at U.S. land borders. And it would provide for a net increase of 40 intelligence analysts and additional resources to be distributed among border patrol sectors that have jurisdiction over major metropolitan drug or narcotics distribution and transportation centers to fight against drug smuggling and money-laundering. 
   For the U.S. Customs Service, the bill would authorize significant additional resources in technology and manpower for peak hours and investigations, including new technology and a net increase of 535 inspectors and 60 special agents for the Southwest border and 375 inspectors for the Northern border. In addition, the bill provides a net increase of 285 inspectors and canine enforcement officers to be distributed at large cargo facilities as needed to process and screen cargo and reduce commercial waiting times on U.S. land borders. It would also authorize a net increase of 360 special agents, 40 intelligence analysts, and additional resources to be distributed among offices that have jurisdiction over major metropolitan drug or narcotics distribution and transportation centers for intensification of efforts against drug smuggling and money-laundering organizations. The bill also provides for a net increase of 50 positions and  additional resources to the Office of Internal Affairs to enhance investigative resources for anticorruption efforts. 
   Mr. President, this bill passed the U.S. Senate by unanimous consent last year, which helped lead to a significant success--a two and a half year delay in the mandate for implementing this system. The 30 month delay was based on a recognition that this program is unworkable. Unfortunately, it provided only a small reprieve that will expire at the beginning of the next Congress. We must build on our success achieved last year. It is time to act, to protect American jobs, to maintain our law enforcement priorities and to uphold common sense.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to support the Education Flexibility Act. This legislation will address our continuing problem in education policy: too many Washington-knows-best policies and red-tape getting in the way of States and local districts as they attempt to address their unique educational needs. 
   Mr. President, over the past 16 years the Education Department has spent more than $175 billion on education programs. Yet achievement scores continue to stagnate and more young people than ever are dropping out of school. One crucial reason for this failure of Federal programs has been the enormous burden of Washington strings and mandates on the States and local school districts. 
   While the Federal Government provides only 7 percent of total spending on education, Washington demands 50 percent of the paperwork filled out by local school districts. That is wrong. It is inefficient, it is unfair and it is not the way to improve our children's education. 
   And this is why I support the Education Flexibility Act. This bill would give every State a chance to waive many of the cumbersome rules, regulations, and red-tape often associated with education programs run by Washington. 
   The State of Michigan currently enjoys the benefits of the Ed-Flex program. In applying for its Ed-Flex waiver, Michigan streamlined several of its State regulations. Further, the very process of seeking waivers has brought Michiganians together to improve education. A working group of State and local officials, school board members, parents and principals was put together in Michigan to determine the best way to streamline regulations and deliver education services. 
   I believe this legislation is moving in the right direction, and would like to see it move even further. I believe Congress should be even more flexible in new authorizations and appropriations. Communities are different and have different needs. Local school districts need to have more options on how to spend Federal education dollars. While some schools may need to hire additional teachers, other school districts may need to implement a summer school program or a literacy program. The point is, schools should have the flexibility and the resources to meet the specific needs of their students. 
   A number of amendments have been offered during debate on this bill. My general view is that to offer new authorizations for additional Washington-based programs is moving in the exact opposite direction of the intent of this bill. This bill seeks to free up local education agencies from the Federal bureaucracies administering programs not to add to them. To the extent that these issues have been raised, I have supported the notion that we should first meet our current fiscal obligation to IDEA in addition to giving State and local education agencies flexibility in administering Federal education resources. I look forward to a fuller discussion of these issues in the proper context of the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   There has been a great deal of debate about the need to fully fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act provisions affecting education. I believe that this raises an important point, particularly given the President's calls for new Federal programs such as his request for 100,000 new teachers, money for which would then compete with IDEA appropriations. 
   For years now parents and local schools have been expressing concern over the rising costs of education for children with special needs. The Federal Government has made a strong commitment to the education needs of disabled children in every way, with one telling exception: it has not lived up to its promise to provide its share of the funds necessary to educate these children. The result has been an increased burden on local school districts, which must make a choice between hiring a new teacher or paying the Federal Government's share of the IDEA bill. 
   Under the Republican Congress, funding for IDEA has increased significantly. Unfortunately, it is still not adequate to meet the costs imposed by federal mandates. I believe we have an obligation to do more to meet these previous commitments before we create new programs and start spending on them money which could go to fulfill our IDEA promise. Moreover, if Congress would actually meet the federal government's obligation to pay 40 percent of the costs for educating special needs children, it would free up millions for schools to spend meeting other specific, local education needs. 
   For example, my state receives approximately $73 million from the federal government for the educational needs of disabled children. If the 40 percent mandate was reached, my state would receive $378 million. By meeting the federal government's obligation to current programs, my state would have $305 million per year more (or one-quarter of the amount appropriated for the new teacher program last year) to be used for whatever needs local school districts might have--including hiring more teachers, after-school programs, or tutoring programs. 
   Mr. President, I recently asked a school district in my state what kind of difference fully funding IDEA could make to them. Here is what I found: If the federal government met its obligation in funding IDEA in the Oakland School District, that district would have $60 million more to spend on educating their students. 
   I think we can all agree on our commitment to elementary and secondary education. The main point of disagreement is over how to deliver federal resources to schools. I suggest that by freeing local school districts of regulations and redtape and by giving them more flexibility in how they administer federal resources, we can free local schools to do what they do best: educate our children. 
   Education flexibility is not the answer to all our educational problems. But I submit that it provides the best means available to get at those answers: allowing the parents, teachers, and local officials in a position to know what their students need to make the important decisions involved in setting education priorities. 
   This is a crucial piece of legislation, Mr. President, and I am proud to lend my full support behind this bill.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, let me begin by acknowledging, as others have, the work and accomplishment of our Senate Budget Committee, and particularly the work of our chairman, in putting together this budget which we are debating today. 
   A lot of people have tried to take credit with respect to the remarkably strong fiscal position we find ourselves in today. But I remind all of our colleagues that when, in 1995, this Senator arrived, notwithstanding tax increases and other such devices, we still were considering budgets with deficits as great as $200 billion for as far as the eye could see. We had one leader in the Senate, the chairman of the Budget Committee, who said, We are not going to allow that to happen; we are going to begin to strengthen the economy and tighten the belt in ways that eliminate the budget deficit. 
   I am proud to be a member of the committee and never to have voted for anything but a balanced budget since I became a part of that committee. I attribute that to our chairman and his staff for the hard work they have done to craft documents that have moved us in this direction. 
   Let me just briefly outline the budget we are looking at here today for the benefit of our colleagues who may be perhaps reaching the wrong conclusions as to what it contains on the basis of some of the speeches we have heard today. I want to set the record straight. Our budget accomplishes a number of important priorities. First, it sets aside every single dollar of the Social Security surplus so that we can use that Social Security surplus for exactly what the public expects us to use it for, and that is to fix Social Security and to ensure its long-term solvency. Later, I will offer an amendment here which will ask the Senate to take a position in support of the kind of protection and lockbox mechanism that will guarantee that every one of those Social Security dollars is used for that purpose. 
   Second, this budget makes important investments in two areas of public policy where I think there is a broad consensus of support, both inside the Senate as well as across America. One of those areas is education. This budget acknowledges a greater Federal investment in the support of education in our country. It does not dictate how those dollars will be spent, obviously. I think a lot of us feel they ought to be spent in the classroom. 
   With the budget chairman here, I ask if he could respond. I believe, Mr. Chairman, that this budget, in fact, increases education spending not only over its baseline increase but even beyond what has been proposed by prominent education advocates such as the President, is that not correct?

   Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Budget Committee chairman. I ask our colleagues to take note of this. 
   We have already heard people come to the floor and talk about how this budget doesn't do enough for education, while at the same time they are now saying it is the President who cares about investment in education. 
   This budget invests more in education than the President of the United States has proposed by a very substantial amount over the next 5 years. We will have a chance later to debate how that investment should be made. 
   I agree with the chairman of the Budget Committee--we want fewer ``Washington knows best'' solutions and more people at the local level making decisions as to how to use the dollars. It is the Republican's budget, not the President's, that puts more money in education. 
   Another investment that I think we all, particularly today, have to acknowledge is important is a greater investment in national security. Obviously, the current events in the Balkans once again remind us that America must have a sufficient investment in our security to be able to meet international challenges we confront. 
   To give the Senate an idea of exactly what we confront with respect to national security today, let me use one statistic. That is the decrease in levels of manpower and weaponry in just the last 8 years. Eight years ago, we engaged in Operation Desert Storm, an accomplishment of great military significance. If we had to do that again today, we would find ourselves severely strapped both with respect to the percentage of our total Armed Forces that would be needed to initiate that effort, as well as the amount of weapons from our total arsenal that would be needed. In fact, I believe it would take about 90 percent of today's Army, two-thirds of our fighter wings, two-thirds of our aircraft carriers, and the entire U.S. Marine Corps based on those current sizes today to replicate what we did in 1991. 
   If that doesn't demonstrate to us the need for a greater investment in national security, I don't know what does. If we need further arguments, I think we need only to look so far as the reinlistment rates which are, as everyone in this body knows, not at the level we require. We need to have better pay and better benefits, pension benefits, and so on, for our Armed Forces in order to encourage more people to join and to stay in the Armed Forces. We have already taken a step in that direction earlier this year, but we need to back up the 
   Soldiers' Bill of Rights with budget authority to be able to move forward. That is what this budget does over the next few years. 
   Finally, I want to talk about two other things. This budget sets aside money not at all connected to Social Security, but, rather, surpluses wholly unrelated to our Social Security payroll taxes for the purpose of reducing the tax burden on the people who pay taxes in this country. What we are talking about is very simple: More money is coming into the Federal Treasury than even the biggest liberal spenders anticipated. It is coming faster than the IRS can count it. It is building up a surplus that is wholly unconnected to Social Security. 
   The question is, What should we do with some of those dollars? This budget sets aside a very substantial amount of money, but certainly not all of that money, for tax relief. Some say this isn't right; the money should be used for more spending programs, new spending programs, or it should go in some way to reduce the tax burden of people who are already paying the taxes. We don't agree. We think this money constitutes an overpayment. It is more money than we expected. If you make an overpayment, you ought to get a refund. That is what this budget  reflects. The refunds ought to go to the people who are making the overpayment. In my judgment, at least in some way, it ought to reflect approximately the percentage of their overpayment. To treat this as suddenly a tax break for a special interest group is simply missing the point. 
   We didn't just shut down a program to be able to finance a tax cut. We didn't make a transfer from one beneficiary group to another in order to be able to afford a tax cut. We said we are taking the money that is coming in and returning it to the American public. The Finance Committee, not the Budget Committee, will make that decision. We think at least a very substantial part of those surplus dollars ought to be used to help allow the people who created this surplus the chance to keep a little bit more of what they earn. 
   Finally, I want to talk about Medicare briefly, because I find the repeated comments with respect to this budget's failure to address Medicare to be so erroneous that they require a response. This budget puts more money into Medicare over the next 5 years than I believe was proposed by the President, and I will defer, again, to the Budget chairman when I have a chance here to clarify that. Unlike the President, we don't cut Medicare over the next 5 years. Furthermore, we set aside over $130 billion in this budget to be used precisely on things like fixing Medicare, that so many of our colleagues seem interested in doing. 
   The one thing we haven't done here that I want to address, we didn't say that we are just sort of going to use general tax revenues in order to stabilize and offset or postpone the insolvency of the Medicare Part A trust fund. We didn't do that here. I don't think that would be an appropriate precedent for us to set. We need to fix the Medicare Part A trust fund to make it work. It is broken. We all know that. 
   There was a Medicare commission and 10 out of 17 people, on a bipartisan basis, agreed that there was a way to do that--in fact, a way that wouldn't even cost as much with respect to Medicare expenditures. They couldn't get 11 votes for that final outcome, but they got 10--including two Members of this body, including the Member selected by the President to chair the Medicare commission, 
   and in my judgment--I am sorry, four Members of this body and two on each side of the aisle. 
   The point is this, Mr. President. The idea that instead of putting together a plan to reform and make Medicare work, the idea to say we are simply going to throw more money into this without any concrete proposal as to how to spend the money, I think is a mistake. 
   In any event, I think this budget addresses the priorities. It locks away money for Social Security and every single penny that Social Security generates in surplus. It increases our investment in education and in national security. It allows us to give people who have paid more taxes than we expected the chance to get a little bit of that back. Finally, it sets aside considerable amounts of money to address our Medicare problems. For that reason, I support it. 
   How much time do I have left?

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, this amendment attempts to embody a principle I discussed in my remarks and which we in the Budget Committee, I think, within the committee at least, indicated we desired to see happen, which is the creation of a lockbox mechanism into which we would make sure every Social Security surplus dollar would go, so it could not be used for any purpose other than to fix Social Security or, until such a Social Security fix was developed and passed, to reduce the national debt. 
   This is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. I want to make that clear. It is not a substantive amendment, per se. But, Mr. President, we all agree that saving Social Security is our No. 1 priority in this Congress. The President, both in his 1998 and his 1999 address, said we should save the Social Security surplus and use it--in this year's speech, he said we should use it to reduce Federal debt, to ensure that it is not squandered on other spending. This amendment embodies that principle in the form of a sense-of-the-Senate amendment and outlines the course by which I think we can accomplish that in the most appropriate fashion. 
   Indeed, Mr. President, this budget resolution agrees with that prioritization and allows for the entire surplus of Social Security to be protected and to substantially reduce the Federal debt held by the public. I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee with whom I have worked on this amendment, and I thank Senator ASHCROFT who joined me in offering that, who I think will both speak to this at some point. 
   This is a very straightforward proposal, one I think will best protect the surplus and strengthen our economy so that the future of Social Security can be best ensured. 
   Let me outline some of the provisions. It would strengthen the off-budget status of Social Security as well as provide for additional points of order  against any bill, amendment, resolution, or conference report that would violate this off-budget treatment. 
   Second, it would create a subcategory of the gross Federal debt limit, the debt held by the public. If this proposal were ultimately put into effect through law, we would then cap that publicly held debt at the current level of $3.6 trillion. We would also then mandate the reduction of that debt level in fiscal years 2000, 2001, and every 2 years thereafter, by the same amount as the Social Security trust fund surplus in those years. 
   These limits would be automatically adjusted as projected Social Security trust fund surpluses change, so as to ensure that we do not force ourselves to reduce the publicly held debt by a greater amount than we actually have available in the Social Security surplus, as well as to ensure that windfall Social Security surpluses would be protected from being raided. The proposal would also allow for a one-time adjustment to accommodate Social Security reform, should the Congress enact such reform. 
   This proposal, if it were actually passed into law, would reduce publicly held debt from $3.6 trillion to $2.4 trillion by the year 2009. I believe that is an even greater reduction than what the President's framework proposal suggested. It thereby locks away a larger portion of the Social Security surplus. 
   To that end, I might add that the budget resolution we have before us contains advisory caps on the publicly held debt limits which mirror those contained in this proposal. However, 
   I believe it is necessary for the Congress to go beyond those advisory caps and to commit itself to reducing this publicly held debt and locking away the Social Security surplus from being spent on other programs. That is why I am joined by 11 colleagues, including Senators DOMENICI and ASHCROFT, as well as the majority leader and the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, in offering a sense-of-the-Senate amendment which will state that it is our intention to pursue such a course of action. 
   This amendment would state that it is our intention to pass legislation to reaffirm the off-budget status of the Social Security trust fund, mandate that the Social Security surplus only be used for the payment of Social Security benefits, Social Security reform, or the reduction of debt held by the public, and provide for protection such as points of order against any legislation which would try to circumvent those protections, ensure the Social Security benefits continue to be paid in full and on time, and accommodate Social Security reform. 
   We think this makes sense. We think it is consistent with colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have been talking about it for an extensive period of time. We think it made sense in this budget resolution to go on record saying this is the direction in which we are going to head. It is one thing to talk about saving Social Security and making sure that Social Security surpluses aren't spent, making sure we reduce the public debt with Social Security surpluses, and so on; but I think talk is one thing, action is another. 
   I suggest that the passage of this amendment which I have offered with my colleagues would be the sort of action that would set us on the right course to make sure that ultimately we do in fact protect the Social Security surpluses so they can only be used to fix Social Security or to pay down the national debt. 
   With that, Mr. President, I will yield the floor. I know other colleagues here want to speak on this issue, and in due course, as we go back and forth, I am sure they will. I thank the budget chairman and the current occupant of the manager's chair, and I thank our ranking member as well, for the opportunity to speak. 
   Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. I will speak quickly. 
   Our plan, which will be voted on, is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment that we should create a Social Security lockbox. This would make sure that any Social Security surplus dollars are used either to fix Social Security or pay down the national debt. People on both sides of the aisle have been claiming that is what they wanted to do. We just heard the first spokesperson in opposition to that raising issues that I think are very dubious complaints. 
   If you don't want to reduce the national debt and you want to spend the Social Security surplus, then vote against this amendment. However, I can't think of any other reason, other than that, to vote no on our amendment. This is a sense of the Senate to set us in the direction of making sure we protect those surpluses.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my condemnation of anti-Semitic statements given by Communist Party members of the Russian Duma. I believe that this is an important issued that must be addressed. 
   The Russian Federation vowed to fight against such discrimination when joining the Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). In order to maintain this commitment, the Russian Duma must censure those in its ranks failing to comply with the recognized OSCE resolution. 
   In the U.S., Congress has joined international organizations and the world community in denouncing the anti-Semitic statements. House Concurrent Resolution 37 asserts that Congress: condemns the statements; commends President Boris Yeltsin and other members of the Russian Duma for rebuking the anti-Semitic statements; and reiterates our firm belief that such discrimination is counter-productive to efforts toward true peace and justice. Furthermore, in dialogue with Russian leaders the U.S. has the opportunity to combat this hate-filled rhetroic. I believe it is of the utmost priority that the anti-Semitic statements be given proper attention in discussions with Russian leaders. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in not only supported House Concurrent Resolution 37, but also in signing onto the letter to Vice-President AL GORE raising the issue of anti-Semitism with Prime Minister Primakove.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on Tuesday morning, the President made it clear that efforts to achieve a negotiated political solution to the Kosovo crisis had failed and that military action in the form of NATO conducted air strikes employing US military equipment and personnel was imminent. Although I am very disappointed that the President did not include congressional leaders much earlier in this important debate, the fact remains that the President has begun the process, under his authority as Commander-in-Chief, which will lead to air strikes and will put the men and women of our armed forces in harm's way. My vote supporting S. Con. Res. 21 was, therefore cast, for the express purpose of conveying support for our troops who, at this moment, are ready to risk their lives on this very dangerous mission. My vote should not be interpreted as an endorsement of or authorization for any escalation to more extensive involvement, such as the introduction of ground troops in this conflict. Indeed, before any such escalation of our military commitment in this crisis is contemplated, I believe the President should give Congress a more significant role in the debate than we have thus far and address many critical questions regarding US military involvement. Specifically, the President must clearly explain what US national security interests are at stake, the mission objectives of our military action, the cost and duration of the deployment, and overall exit strategy. Failure to consult with Congress on these important issues in a timely fashion would significantly affect the extent of my support for any subsequent, broader US involvement.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am joined today by Senator CRAPO in introducing a Sense of the Senate Resolution rejecting a new tax proposed by the Clinton administration. As part of the administration's fiscal year 2000 budget proposal, this tax would be levied on the investment income earned by nonprofit trade associations and professional societies. This proposal, which would tax any income earned through interest, dividends, capital gains, rents and royalties in excess of $10,000, imposes a tremendous burden on thousands of small- and mid-sized trade associations and professional societies currently exempt under 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
   The administration would like us to believe that this tax is targeted to a few large associations, affecting only those ``lobbying organizations'' which exist as tax shelters for members and to further the goals of special interests. Mr. President, nothing could be further from the truth. 
   This new tax would affect an estimated 70,000 registered trade associations and professional societies. The bulk of these associations operate at a state and local level, many of whom perform little, if any, lobbying function. In fact, associations rely on investment income to perform such vital services as education, training, standard setting, industry safety, research and statistical data, and community outreach. Through association-organized volunteer programs, Americans contribute more than 173 million volunteer hours per year, at a value estimated at over $2 billion annually. 
   These organizations already contribute millions in taxes for any activities which place them in competition with for-profit businesses. Yet the administration would like to impose a new tax on income earned outside of the competitive business environment, income which is used to fund functions serving the public welfare. Unlike for-profit corporations, investment income does not go to shareholders, individuals, or other companies. Associations do not have the liberty of simply raising prices, as do ordinary corporations, to cover increased costs. 
   Mr. President, faced with an additional increase in taxes of $1.44 billion over the next five years, many associations will be forced to cut back on important services, and some may not survive an economic downturn without the small cushion their investments provide. 
   Without such services provided by associations, the Government will be forced to step in, increasing expenditures and creating additional Government programs and departments. 
   During a time when the Government is projecting on-budget tax surpluses of more than $800 billion over the next 10 years, it is unconscionable that we allow the administration to levy a new tax on these nonprofit organizations.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today, I along with 19 of my colleagues will be re-introducing the Child Custody Protection Act. This legislation will make it a federal offense to transport a minor across state lines to obtain an abortion if this action circumvents a state parental involvement law. 
   Last year, this bill received a majority of votes but fell short of the sixty votes needed for cloture. It is my hope that this year the Senate will listen to the 74 percent of Americans who favor parental consent prior to a minor girl receiving an abortion. This Baseline & Associates poll, conducted last summer, reveals that the American public favors parental consent laws and when asked specifically about this legislation, the American public is even more supportive. Eighty five percent of those who participated in the poll believed that minor girls should not be taken across state lines to obtain an abortion without their parents' knowledge. 
   These poll numbers reinforce what common sense already tells us: parents need to be involved with the major medical and emotional decisions of their children. When they are not involved, the health and emotional well being of their child is in jeopardy. 
   Last year, we heard from Joyce Farley, whose 13 year old daughter was raped, taken across state lines for a secret abortion by the rapist's mother, and dropped off 30 miles from home suffering from complications from an incomplete abortion. Mrs. Farley told of the trauma to her daughter from this stranger's actions. Luckily, Mrs. Farley found out about the abortion and could obtain appropriate medical care for her daughter. If this abortion had remained secret, Mrs. Farley's daughter's life could have been in danger. 
   Whatever one's position on abortion, every American should recognize the crucial role of parents in their minor child's decision whether or not to undergo this procedure. Parental notification and consent laws exist for a reason. While most such laws provide for possible judicial bypass, they by nature intend to protect the rights and integrity of the family. More than 20 states have recognized the need to protect both the minor and the integrity of the family and have parental involvement laws in effect. My legislation adds no new provisions to state-enacted parental involvement laws. It does not impose parental involvement requirements on states that have not passed such laws. The Child Custody Protection Act simply prevents the undermining of parental involvement laws in states that have them.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas. I wanted to just briefly speak in relationship to the Harkin-Specter amendment with regard to the tobacco recoupment issue and the issue of exactly what should happen to the funds that the States are now entitled to receive as a result of the legal settlement that was achieved between 46 States and the tobacco companies. 
   Mr. President, this, to me, should be a pretty clear-cut result. The States entered into this litigation. They did all the work. They made the case persuasively. They were finally able to prevail on the merits, in terms of convincing the other side to engage in a settlement. So, for those reasons, it does not seem to me to be particularly difficult to conclude that the benefits, the proceeds, the settlement moneys ought to go to the States. I believe, since the States did this on their own and since the States are certainly quite knowledgeable about the needs of their constituents, that we should allow them not only to be the recipients of those funds but we should give them the discretion to make the decisions that are necessary as to what priorities to set in spending those dollars. 
   Let me just begin briefly with the basic case itself. The States joined together. The Federal Government did not play a role in the technical sense, or as a party to the proceedings. Indeed, in his State of the Union Address the President even indicated he was directing the Department of Justice and the Attorney General to bring a separate litigation on behalf of the people of the United States against the tobacco companies. Presumably, one would not bring that case if one did not think that the States' decisions were separate from any kind of Federal component. 
   Once the States won, of course, money became available. Unfortunately, at that point the Federal Government, through the Health Care Finance Administration, is attempting to intercede in the President's budget to a very substantial degree, trying to wrest control of a substantial portion of those dollars. As I recall, roughly 60 percent of the first 5 years' revenues to the States which, under the President's budget, would, instead, be diverted to Washington. The basis for their claim is, in my judgment, a weak one, predicated on the argument that Medicaid overpayments are to be returned to the States. This is not a Medicaid overpayment from the Federal Government. This is a settlement between the States and these tobacco companies, a settlement fairly reached and a settlement based on the States' belief that their citizens had been in some ways the victims of the illnesses relating to tobacco. 
   That said, we have now moved to a slightly different stage. In the content of this supplemental appropriation bill is language which would make it absolutely and explicitly clear that the States will receive these dollars. Now, we have before us an amendment that says: OK, if the States are going to get the money they still have to spend it on the priorities set by bureaucrats in Washington. Indeed, it is my understanding that the proposed amendment would essentially place the Secretary of Health and Human Services in a position to determine what programs qualify for, and whether States are in compliance with, these Federal mandates for 25 years. Basically, what this amendment says is approximately 50 percent, 50 percent of the settlement moneys have to be spent the way Washington dictates, and that the Secretary of Health and Human Services will decide not only what that dictation means but whether the States have done it. The States will be required to engage in extensive recordkeeping and an annual process of appealing for approval, the same kind of bureaucratic redtape that costs money and complicates, in my judgment, far too many things we do already. 
   If the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and it's not just this Secretary but any Secretary over the next quarter of a century, doesn't agree with the States, they can then veto, in effect, the States' expenditures costing the States as much as approximately $123 billion during that time. 
   The bottom line is, I think, a fairly simple one. Who knows best what the needs of the States are, the States themselves or bureaucrats in the Department of Health and Human Services? I believe the States do. I think we can trust the States to make the right decisions as to how to spend the moneys derived from the tobacco settlements. That is assuming, of course, that we have any right to tell them in the first place. I do not even acknowledge that. But assuming there even was a right of the Federal Government in some respect, I just cannot imagine why anybody here in Washington is going to do a better job than people at the State level in making these judgments. 
   The priorities that have been set which relate to such things as counteradvertising or youth awareness or public health priorities, are priorities virtually every State has already set for themselves. Many of the States, including I believe my own, have done great things along the way to try to discourage smoking by young people and to address public health needs. If they have done that well, the notion that they now have to spend new moneys recouped through this settlement on these programs at least in my judgment would be a grievous error. 
   So it comes back to something we talk about a lot around here: Who  should set priorities and who knows best? In my view, the people at the local and State level, on issues and problems like this, do know best. They ought to make the decisions as to how the money, which was rightfully won by them in these lawsuits, ought to be spent. And we in Washington ought to be happy that there is going to be an abundance of resources going to the States to address the top priorities of those States. 
   The notion that we have to dictate how 50 percent or even 30 percent or 10 percent of these dollars have to be spent, I think both, A, incorrectly presumes that somehow we had a stake in the lawsuit and, B, that, somehow we know better. I believe it has been proven time after time that we do not know better, particularly in these types of matters which obviously have peculiarities that differ from State to State. 
   So, for those reasons I rise in opposition to the amendment. I look forward to working with the Senator from Texas and with a variety of other Senators who have been working together as cosponsors of the legislation that is included in the supplemental appropriation bill, to make sure that first and foremost the States get access to all the money won in the settlements and that, second, the States have the right to make the decisions as to how to spend those dollars. 
   So, Mr. President, I hope we will be successful in preventing agreement to this amendment. I look forward to working on this until it is completed. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Dr. Samuel R. Dismond Jr. and HealthPlus of Michigan for their strong commitment to health, education and the well-being of the Genesee Valley area. 
   Dr. Dismond is the current chief of staff at Hurley Medical Center. Throughout his distinguished medical career, he has served on a number of influential boards. Dr. Dismond has also been recognized numerous times for his contributions to the medical profession. By supporting his community and actively promoting research in health related fields, Dr. Dismond has made a difference in a number of patient's and associate's lives. 
   HealthPlus of Michigan has worked tirelessly to promote lung health within their organization and their community, including efforts to help any willing employee or patient quit smoking. This was accomplished by offering various smoking cessation and behavioral support programs. However, the biggest step HealthPlus has taken was instituting guidelines requiring every physician affiliated with HealthPlus to inquire about his or her patient's smoking status during each visit and to track it within their permanent medical records. Also, the physician must encourage every smoker to attempt to stop smoking. HealthPlus has also donated money to the American Lung Association so that they might help to teach area children about asthma. 
   It is with great pleasure that I announce to the U.S. Senate Dr. Samuel R. Dismond as the recipient of this year's American Lung Association ``1998 Individual Health Advocate of the Year'' and HealthPlus as the ``1998 Corporate Health Advocate of the Year.'' These awards will be presented at the 16th annual Health Advocate of the Year Awards Dinner on March 18, 1999 in Grand Blanc, Michigan. I extend my sincerest congratulations to Dr. Dismond and HealthPlus of Michigan.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Great Lakes Chamber Music Festival, a dynamic organization which has made an incredible contribution to Michigan's culture. The Chamber's concerts have really left their imprint on our State, with some twenty concerts in and near Detroit each year, many of which occur in the venues of the Festival's sponsors--St. Hugo of the Hills Catholic Church, Temple Beth El, and Kirk in the Hills. Additional concert locations range from the Detroit Zoo to the Detroit Institute of Arts. The Festival is administered by Detroit Chamber Winds & Strings, which performs a number of the concerts. But today, I would like to take a moment to officially welcome the Chamber to our nation's capital for what is expected to be a stellar performance in the Library of Congress on Friday evening. 
   The Great Lakes Chamber Music Festival was born in 1994. The Festival is sponsored by three religious institutions, representing Catholic, Jewish, and Protestant faiths, and Detroit Chamber Winds & Strings, a prominent chamber music ensemble. 
   Pianist James Tocco has been Artistic Director of the Festival since its inception. A native Detroiter, Mr. Tocco has brought a rotating contingent of world-class musicians to the Festival, creating an event of national significance. The list of performers reads like a long ``Who's who'' in chamber music, including Ruth Laredo, Peter Oundjian, Paul Katz, Miriam Fried, Gilbert, Kalish, Philip Setzer, the St. Lawrence Quartet, Peter Wiley, Ida and Ani Kavafian, and others. The Festival provides a major educational initiative to assist ensembles emerging to professional stature. Entitled the Shouse Institute, this program brings groups from throughout the world to Detroit for performances and coachings by Festival artists. These young artists attend the Festival tuition-free and receive complimentary lodging. 
   So in welcoming the Great Lakes Chamber Festival to Washington, D.C., and thanking all of those from the Chamber that made this possible, I also would like to single out Gwen and Evan Weiner, dear friends of our family who introduced the Chamber to me and who have played a critical role in enhancing cultural life in Michigan, as well as Harriet Rotter, another close friend who has contributed a great deal of time and energy to this effort. Gwen, Evan, Harriet, and the many others who are involved with the Chamber Festival are sterling examples of community leadership at its best, and I am pleased they are here today. Finally, I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the hard and dedicated work of Maury Okun, the Chamber Festival's Executive Director, an invaluable member of the Chamber Festival team. 
   Again, I want to commend all those involved in making The Great Lakes Chamber Music Festival a tremendous success, and extend my warmest wishes and best of luck for the concert Friday night and in the future.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to cosponsor S. 261, the Trade Fairness Act of 1999. I believe this legislation is crucial to our attempts to save American jobs from unfair competition and dumping. 
   Specifically, Mr. President, we must implement this legislation to protect our steelworkers from imports dumped into our domestic markets by our Russian, Asian and Brazilian competitors. 
   American steelworkers have proven that they are our nation's backbone. They provide the materials on which our shipping, manufacturing, indeed our entire industrial base rely. In my state's Upper Peninsula two mines, the Tilden and the Empire, employ almost 2,000 Michiganians. Last year the workers in these mines produced over 15 million tons of iron ore pellets. They paid $8 million in taxes. Time and again they have stood up for America, and it is time for America to stand up for them. 
   We must stand up for these hard working men and women, Mr. President, because they face a very real threat to their livelihoods. Let me cite a few numbers. By October of last year Japan had already doubled its imports to the United States from the year before. Just in that month of October, Japan sent 882,000 tons of steel to the United States, an all-time record. Finally, in that month alone 4.1 million net tons of steel were imported to the United States. 
   The reasons for this steep increase in imports are threefold. First, the Federal Reserve's longstanding tight money policy produced actual deflation in commodity prices, deflation from which our steel industry has yet to recover. Second, the Asian, Russian and Brazilian economic crises are forcing those countries to rely on exports to keep their economies afloat. The U.S. is the world's biggest market, and so they have targeted us. Third, the International Monetary Fund convinced these countries to raise interest rates and devalue currencies, which allowed their steel to undercut our prices. 
   Combined, these factors have encouraged the unfair trade practice of dumping, selling steel in the United States at prices below the cost of production. This practice threatens disastrous consequences for our steelworkers and for  our economy. Already, Mr. President, 10,000 workers have been laid off, with more than twice that many put on reduced hours. 
   We cannot stand by while American workers lose their jobs. We cannot abide the unfair trade practice of dumping. We have worked hard--these men and women have worked hard--to build a prosperous America. We cannot sacrifice them to pay for bureaucrats' mistakes, be they in Washington, Tokyo, or Moscow. 
   Mr. President, I have never made a secret of my strong, free-trade views. But free trade must also be fair trade. Our laws already recognize this principle. After all, we already have trade laws on the books intended to deal with these kinds of issues. It is time to enforce them. In addition, however, I believe the fact that these trade laws are not being enforced shows the need for reform. 
   That is why I am cosponsoring the Trade Fairness Act. This legislation will lower the threshold for establishing injury to our industries so that we may more effectively protect them from unfair trade practices. 
   Under this law imports that have a causal link to substantial injury in an industry will trigger action. Substantial injury will be determined by the International Trade Commission, considering ``the rate and amount of the increase in imports of the product concerned in absolute and relative terms; the share of the domestic market taken by increased imports; changes in the levels of sales, production, productivity, capacity utilization, profits and losses, and employment.'' 
   In addition, this legislation establishes a comprehensive steel import permit and monitoring program modeled on similar systems in Canada and Mexico. The program would require importers to provide information regarding country of origin, quantity, value, and Harmonized Traffic Schedule number. The legislation also requires the Administration to release the data collected to the public in aggregate form on an expedited basis. 
   The information provided by the licensing program will allow the Commerce Department and the steel industry to monitor the influx of steel imports into the U.S. Presently, it is very difficult to obtain timely information regarding the volume of steel that enters the country. It usually take 2-3 months before specific figures can be obtained. This makes it very difficult to gauge the extent of the problem when the damage is occurring. 
   Mr. President, this legislation provides us with the tools we need to protect working Americans from unfair foreign competition. It will prevent undue hardship while upholding the standards of free, fair and open trade. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of the forty-third anniversary of Tunisia's independence. Although Tunisia received its independence in 1956, America has maintained close ties with Tunisia since 1797. This historic partnership has promoted peace and cooperation between our two countries. 
   In America's early years, Tunisia provided important commercial advantages and a safe harbor for American vessels establishing maritime trade in the Mediterranean. During America's darkest hour, the Civil War, Tunisia supported the anti-slavery movement, and its leaders conversed with American officials on the significance of human dignity. 
   During World War II, Tunisia continued to fight for the values of the free world by supporting American and Allied forces as they landed in North Africa. After the war, Tunisia sought American support for its independence; and in 1956, the United States was the first world power to recognize Tunisia's newly won sovereignty. 
   Since that time, the United States and Tunisia have garnered further achievements in bilateral cooperation. Impressive strides have been taken in advancing the development of Tunisia, as well as sustaining further security and stability in all relations. Tunisia and the United States have also been important allies in striving for progress towards peace in the Middle East. 
   As the relationship between Tunisia and the United States continues to grow, I believe it is important that we take time to observe this important milestone. In echoing the historic words of President Dwight Eisenhower, it is my sincere hope and desire that Tunisia continues to consider the United States as its friend and partner in freedom.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to mark the ninth anniversary of the restoration of Lithuania's independence. I also rise to pay tribute to the Lithuanian people for their perseverance and sacrifice, which enabled them to achieve the freedom they now enjoy. 
   On March 11, 1990, the newly elected Lithuanian Parliament, fulfilling its electoral mandate from the people of Lithuania, declared the restoration of Lithuania's independence and the establishment of a democratic state. This marked a great moment for Lithuania and for lovers of freedom around the globe. 
   The people of Lithuania endured a 51-year foreign occupation. Resulting from the infamous Hitler-Stalin Pact of 1939, this Soviet occupation brought with it communist dictatorship and cultural genocide. But the Lithuanian people were not defeated. They resisted their oppressors and kept their culture, their faith and their dream of independence very much alive even during the hardest times. 
   The people of Lithuania were even able to mobilize and sustain a non-violent movement for social and political change, a movement which came to be known as Sajudis. This people's movement helped guarantee a peaceful transition to independence through full participation in democratic elections on February 24, 1990. 
   Unfortunately, the peace did not last. In January 1991, ten months after restoration of independence, the people and government of Lithuania faced a bloody assault by foreign troops intent on overthrowing their democratic institutions. Lithuanians withstood this assault, maintaining their independence and their democracy. Their successful use of non-violent resistance to an oppressive regime is an inspiration to all. 
   On September 17, 1991, Lithuania became a member of the United Nations and is a signatory to a number of its organizations and other international agreements. It also is a member of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and the Council of Europe. Lithuania is an associate member of the European Union, has applied for NATO membership and is currently negotiating for membership in the WTO, OECD and other Western organizations. 
   The United States established diplomatic relations with Lithuania on July 28, 1992. But our nation never really broke with the government and people of Lithuania. The U.S. never recognized the forcible incorporation of Lithuania into the U.S.S.R., and views the present Government of Lithuania as a legal continuation of the inter-war republic. Indeed, for over fifty years the United States maintained a bipartisan consensus that our nation would refuse to recognize the forcible incorporation of Lithuania into the former Soviet Union. 
   Our relations with Lithuania are strong, friendly and mutually beneficial. Lithuania has enjoyed Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) treatment with the U.S. since December, 1991. Through 1996, the U.S. has committed over $100 million to Lithuania's economic and political transformation and to address humanitarian needs. In 1994, the U.S. and Lithuania signed an agreement of bilateral trade and intellectual property protection, and in 1997 a bilateral investment treaty. 
   In 1998 the U.S. and Lithuania signed The Baltic Charter Partnership. That charter recalls the history of American relations with the area and underscores our ``real, profound, and enduring'' interest in the security and independence of the three Baltic states. As the Charter also notes, our interest in a Europe whole and free will not be ensured until Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are secure. 
   Mr. President, I commend the people of Lithuania for their courage and perseverance in using peaceful means to regain their independence. I pledge to work with my colleagues to continue working to secure the freedom and independence of Lithuania and its Baltic neighbors, and I join with the people of Lithuania as they celebrate their independence.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on my decision to support two resolutions concerning the Middle East peace process. Both of these resolutions express congressional opposition to any efforts by either party in the peace process to attempt, through unilateral actions, to pre-judge or pre-determine the outcome of the negotiations currently taking place between the Palestinians and the Israelis. I would like to take a moment to explain why I decided to cosponsor these resolutions. 
   I believe that one of the most important foreign policy issues facing America today is how to encourage peace in the Middle East. Reaching a peace agreement at this time is extremely critical, not only to our strategic interests in the region, but to the parties themselves. I remain optimistic that despite the various setbacks, it will still be possible for the parties to achieve a just and lasting peace. 
   However, in my view, the only way to achieve such a peace is for the parties to abide by the plan of negotiations as set out in the context of Madrid, Oslo, and most recently, in the Wye Plantation Agreement. This plan clearly sets forth a structure which dictates the timetable and order of discussing certain very critical issues. 
   I am particularly concerned that any unilateral actions by the parties or co-sponsors which might pre-judge the outcome or change this plan would have a great potential to undermine what limited chance we have for peace in the Middle East. 
   Within this context, the parties, with the full support of the co-sponsors, agreed to delay the discussion of many of the most critical and difficult issues until final status negotiations, and promised not to take any unilateral actions which might pre-judge or pre-determine the outcome of those issues. My opposition to unilateral actions by any party or co-sponsor, including the United States, is well known and on the record. It was, for example, the principal basis for my opposition in 1995 to S. 1322, which mandated the relocation of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. 
   Similarly, just as I was concerned about the potentially injurious impact on the peace process of prematurely addressing issues relating to Jerusalem, I am equally concerned about the impact of a unilateral and premature declaration by the Palestinians regarding statehood. I believe such a unilateral declaration by the Palestinian Authority would almost certainly undermine future progress toward a peace accord. 
   It is my understanding that the Administration's position is consistent with these congressional resolutions, and in fact the United States has maintained ongoing discussions with the Palestinians to discourage them from unilaterally declaring a state outside the context of the negotiations. 
   My support for both of these resolutions are based on this principle alone: That any unilateral actions by either parties or co-sponsors are disruptive and damaging to the peace process as a whole. My support for these resolutions is not a comment regarding what the Palestinian authorities should do if the peace process fails and no final status agreement can be reached. Nor is it a comment on the merits of a Palestinian state. Nor, finally, is it a suggestion that a Palestinian state should not be created as part of the final status agreement should the parties decide upon that themselves. Indeed, for the process to be successful, the Palestinians must be permitted to exercise their independence. 
   My support for these resolutions is thus exclusively and solely a statement that in my opinion, a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state at this time would probably destroy any chance to reach a just and lasting peace between the parties. Peace is too important--and too much effort toward achieving such a peace has been expended by all parties and co-sponsors for it to be jeopardized in this way.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senators SESSIONS, LEVIN, KENNEDY and HARKIN to introduce an important piece of legislation that will honor one of the most important figures in the American civil rights movement, Rosa Parks. 
   Given her immense contributions to our Nation, we believe it is only fitting that she be honored with a Congressional Gold Medal. 
   For decades, Mr. President, African-Americans in this country, this birth place of freedom, were treated as second class citizens, or less. 
   Even after the moral enormity of slavery had finally been ended, African-Americans were subjected to discrimination, segregation and, if they resisted, prosecution and even lynching. 
   Rosa Parks set in motion the events that brought to an end the shameful history of Jim Crow. 
   Rosa Parks refused to obey the segregation laws in her home city of Montgomery, AL, and go to the back of the bus. 
   When confronted, she refused give up her seat on that bus to a white man, even when threatened with jail. 
   She was arrested, and the reaction would change the face of this Nation. 
   Over 40,000 people boycotted Montgomery buses for 381 days. 
   Faced with official condemnation and violence, these brave men and women maintained their unity until the bus segregation laws were finally changed. 
   Their actions brought about the 1956 Supreme Court decision declaring the Montgomery segregation law unconstitutional and spurred the civil rights movement to further action; action which produced the Civil Rights Act of 1964, breaking down the barriers of legal discrimination against African-Americans and establishing equality before the law as a reality for all Americans. 
   Rosa Parks set these historic events in motion. 
   She was the first woman to join the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP and served as an active volunteer for the Montgomery Voters League. 
   Because of her strength, perseverance and quiet dignity, all Americans have been freed from the moral stain of segregation. 
   And this mother of the civil rights movement continues to be active in the struggle for equality and the empowerment of the disenfranchised. 
   Ms. Parks has received many awards in recognition of her efforts for racial harmony, including the NAACP's highest honor for civil rights contributions, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian honor, and the first International Freedom Conductor Award from the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center. 
   Throughout her life, Rosa Parks has been an example of the power of conviction and quiet dignity in pursuit of justice and empowerment. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting legislation to bestow upon her the Congressional Gold Medal she so well deserves. 
   Mr. President, I remember as a young student in grade school being told the story of the woman who said she would not move to the back of the bus. I did not know who that was by name. I just remember being so struck and touched by that story. I did not realize someday I would have the opportunity to meet that lady. She lives in my State of Michigan today. I have had a chance to get to know her a bit, but, more importantly, to work with her organizations there which do fine work for our communities and for our country. 
   So Mr. President, I am very proud to be here today to offer this Congressional Gold Medal proposal. I want to thank our cosponsors. We are very hopeful that others will join us so we can pass this proposal as soon as possible. 
   At this time, Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Senator from Alabama.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am joined today by Senators WYDEN, HATCH, KERREY, COVERDELL, DASCHLE, JEFFORDS, LIEBERMAN, ALLARD, GORTON, MCCONNELL, and BURNS in introducing the New Millennium Classrooms Act. This legislation will effectively encourage the donation of computer equipment and software to schools through tax deductions and credits. In addition, enhanced tax credits would be applied to equipment donated to schools within designated empowerment zones, enterprise communities, and Indian reservations. 
   Advanced technology has fueled unprecedented economic growth and transformed the way Americans do business and communicate with each other. Despite these gains, this same technology is just beginning to have an impact on our classrooms and how we educate our children. It is projected that 60 percent of all jobs will require high-tech computer skills by the year 2000, yet 32 percent of our public schools have only one classroom with access to the Internet. 
   Mr. President, it is imperative that we act now to provide our nation's students with the necessary technological background so they can succeed in tomorrow's high-tech workplace and ensure our country's future position in competitive world markets. 
   The Department of Education recommends that there be at least one computer for every five students. According to the Educational Testing Service, in 1997, there was only one computer for every 24 students, on average. Not only are our classrooms sadly under-equipped, but even those classrooms with computers often have systems which are so old and outdated they are unable to run even the most basic software programs, are not multi-media capable and cannot access the Internet. Mr. President, one of the more common computers in our schools today is the Apple IIc, a computer so archaic it is now on display at the Smithsonian. 
   While this technological deficiency affects all of our schools, the students who are in the most need are receiving the least amount of computer instruction and exposure. 
   According to the Secretary of Education, 75.9 percent of households with an annual income over $75,000 have computers, compared to only 11 percent of households with incomes under $10,000. This disparity exists when comparing households with Internet access as well. While 42 percent of families with annual incomes over $75,000 have on-line capability, only 10 percent of families with incomes $25,000 or less can access the Internet from their homes. 
   Rural areas and inner cities fall below the national average for households that have computers. 
   Nationwide, 40.8 percent of white households have computers, while only 19 percent of African-American and Hispanic households do. This disparity is increasing, not decreasing. And, Mr. President, this unfortunate trend is not confined simply to individual households, it is present in our schools as well. 
   Education should be a great equalizer, providing the means by which Americans can take advantage of all the opportunities this country can offer, regardless of background. Yet, Educational Testing Service statistics show schools with 81 percent or more economically disadvantaged students have only one multi-media computer for every 32 students, while a school with 20 percent or fewer economically disadvantaged students will have a multi-media computer for every 22 students. That is a difference of 10 students per computer. Furthermore, schools with 90 percent or more minority students have only one multimedia computer for every 30 students. 
   Mr. President, this is simply unacceptable. 
   The Taxpayers Relief Act of 1997 contains a provision, The 21st Century Classrooms of 1997, which allows a corporation to take a deduction from taxable income for the donation of computer technology, equipment and software. 
   Unfortunately, since The 21st Century Classrooms Act of 1997 has been implemented, there has not been a significant increase in corporate donations of computers and related equipment to K-12 schools. The current incentives do not provide enough tax relief to outweigh the costs incurred by the donors. Moreover, the restrictions limiting the age of eligible equipment to two years or less and the narrow definition of ``original use'' has greatly  limited the number of computers available for qualified donation. As a result, the Detwiler Foundation, a California-based organization with unparalleled status as a facilitator of computer donations to K-12 schools nationwide, reports they ``have not witnessed the anticipated increase in donation activity'' since the enactment 
   of the 1997 tax deduction. 
   Mr. President, to increase the amount of technology donated to schools, the New Millennium Classrooms Act would expand the parameters of the current tax deduction and add a tax credit, which operates like the R&D tax credit. Specifically, the bill would do the following: 
   First, this legislation would allow a tax credit equal to 30 percent of the fair market value of the donated computer equipment. An increased tax credit provides greater incentive for companies to donate computer technology and equipment to schools. This includes computers, peripheral equipment, software and fiber optic cable related to computer use. 
   Second, it would expand the age limit to include equipment three years old or less. Many companies do not update their equipment within the two year period. This provision increases the availability of eligible equipment. Three year old computers equipped with Pentium-based or equivalent chips have the processing power, memory, and graphics capabilities to provide sufficient Internet and multi-media access and run any necessary software. 
   Third, the current limitation on ``original use'' would be expanded to include the original equipment manufacturers or any corporation that reacquires the equipment. By expanding the number of donors eligible for the tax credit, the number of computers available will increase as well. 
   Lastly, enhanced tax credits equal to 50 percent of the fair market value of the equipment donated to schools located within designated empowerment zones, enterprise communities, and Indian reservations would be implemented. Doubling the amount of the tax credits for donations made to schools in economically-distressed areas will increase the availability of computers to the children that need it most. 
   Bringing our classrooms into the 21st century will require a major national investment. According to a Rand Institute study, it will cost $15 billion, or $300 per student, to provide American schools with the technology needed to educate our youth; the primary cost being the purchase and installation of computer equipment. At a time when the government is planning to spend $1.2 billion to wire schools and libraries to the Internet, the demand for this sophisticated hardware will be greater than ever. 
   The Detwiler Foundation estimates that if just 10 percent of the computers that are taken out of service each year were donated to schools, the national ratio of students-to-computers would be brought to five-to-one or less. This would meet, or even exceed, the ratio recommended by the Department of Education. 
   The New Millennium Classrooms Act will provide powerful tax incentives for American businesses to donate top quality high-tech equipment to our nation's classrooms without duly increasing Federal Government expenditures or creating yet another federal program or department. Encouraging private investment and involvement, this Act will keep control where it belongs--with the teachers, the parents, and the students. 
   This bill is not simply another ``targeted tax break.'' Broad-based tax relief and reform efforts should work to lower tax rates across the board while continuing to retain and improve upon the core tax incentives for education, homeownership, and charitable contributions. The New Millennium Classrooms Act expands the parameters and thus the effectiveness of an already existing education and charity tax incentive, one which will effectively bring top-of-the-line technology into all of our schools. 
   With the passage of the New Millennium Classrooms Act, all our children will have an equal chance at succeeding in the new technological millennium.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. I would like to call to the attention of my colleagues an article on ``Improving Human Rights in China'' written by Jim Dorn, vice president for academic affairs at the Cato Institute. Dorn advocates that Congress return to legislation ``designed to change China's stand on human rights and to liberate the Chinese people from religious and political persecution.'' This call is particularly timely given the most recent wave of repression against those inside China who seek to widen freedom and political discourse in that country. Higher taxes in the form of higher tariffs is not the answer, as Dorn points out. However, that does not mean America and the U.S. Congress, and, indeed, the President, should not be strongly advocating the rule of law and respect for political dissent in China. I recommend Jim Dorn's piece to my colleagues and encourage continued vigilance in the defense of civil liberties and freedom for the Chinese people. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the article be printed in the RECORD.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise now in conjunction with the distinguished majority leader, Mr. LOTT, and with the distinguished Senator from Missouri, Mr. ASHCROFT, to introduce legislation which will repeal the 1993 increase in the tax on Social Security benefits. 
   As my colleagues are aware, senior citizens pay Federal taxes on a portion of their Social Security benefits if they receive additional income from savings or from work. Before 1993, seniors paid taxes on half their Social Security benefits if their combined income, as it is described--which means their adjusted gross income and one-half the amount of the Social Security benefits they receive--exceeded $25,000 for individuals or $32,000 for couples. 
   Soon after coming into office, however, the new administration increased this tax on these middle-income retirees as part of the 1993 tax bill. For individuals now, after that, with combined incomes exceeding $34,000, and couples with combined incomes exceeding $44,000, the tax increase on the percentage of their Social Security benefits subject to taxation went from 50 percent to 85 percent. This provision increased taxes for nearly one-quarter of Social Security recipients. It in large part produced an increase of 7.5 percent in the tax burden on America's seniors, a tax increase that was more than double the 3.5 percent that the rest of that legislation imposed on other Americans. 
   This tax increase is unfair. It penalizes senior citizens, and it penalizes them for exactly the wrong reason--for saving to achieve security in their retirement. It also unfairly punishes seniors who have the capacity and choose to continue to work. 
   We are engaged, as you know, in an important debate here in Congress, the debate over the future of our Social Security system. Republicans have joined with Democrats in pledging to set aside the entire Social Security trust fund surplus over the next 15 years, to shore up that system, to make certain it is available for the senior citizens both of today and tomorrow. 
   At such a time, with dire warnings of impending bankruptcies still ringing in our ears, it seems the last thing the Federal Government should be doing is to discourage people from work and saving for their retirement. 
   Wise Americans have always saved for their retirement. They have sought to be independent in their old age by working hard and by putting aside a portion of their income. Yet the 1993 tax increase proposed by the President and ultimately passed into law by the Congress changed the rules for these wise savers. After plans and investment decisions had already been made, this proposal came in and declared that savings and hard work would be taxed significantly more heavily than they had been before.  
   As we work to shore up Social Security, we must not allow the Federal Government to punish people for working and saving. We must not allow the Federal Government to tell people they might as well not save for retirement, that they must depend solely on Social Security benefits for their well-being once they retire. 
   What is more, we should not forget that the projected Federal budget surplus over the next 10 years alone is slated to reach approximately $2.565 trillion. We have agreed, wisely in my view, to save the bulk of this surplus to shore up Social Security. But surely, at a time when we foresee at least $787 billion in surpluses in addition to those earmarked for Social Security, the Federal Government can afford, in my judgment, to give seniors and those planning for their retirement the kind of tax relief they need to prepare for their futures and to keep our economy strong. 
   That means, in my view, that we must repeal this onerous tax hike for the sake of our seniors and for the sake of our economy as a whole. Discouraging savings has always been a recipe for economic disaster because it reduces the amount of money available for investment in new jobs and a growing economy. 
   Now is the time to reduce the extent to which Washington discourages savings. It is time to repeal this tax hike so we may increase savings, investment, and the financial security of our senior citizens. 
   Mr. President, this legislation has a simple purpose: It repeals the 1993 ill-considered Social Security tax hike returning our seniors to the position they were in prior to 1993. 
   It restores a modicum of fairness to our Byzantine tax structure and to our dealings with senior citizens. It is important legislation for our seniors, for our Social Security system and for the future of our Nation, and I urge my colleagues' strong support. 
   In short, Mr. President, I think we should do everything possible to make it feasible for seniors, both today and especially in the future, to be able to live in retirement in a comfortable way and to not solely depend on the Social Security system. We know the burdens that system will take. 
   By discouraging savings during people's working years, by discouraging people from continuing to work after they reach retirement age, we are actually, I think, undermining our chances of providing the kind of long-term income security that Americans deserve in their old age. 
   For that reason, we should, in my judgment, repeal this tax hike. We should make that a priority this year, and we should then couple that action with other action aimed at shoring up the Social Security system so it not only works for today's seniors, but for the seniors of our future as well.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor the Senate resolution designating March 25, 1999 as ``Greek Independence Day.'' March 25 marks the 178th anniversary of the beginning of the revolution which freed the Greek people from the Ottoman Empire. 
   America is composed of a wide variety of cultures, joined together by their belief in fundamental principles of human dignity. Through their arts, literature, culture, food and dance, Greek-Americans have contributed to the diversity and strength of the United States. Immigration from Greece first started in 1767 and then began in earnest in the late 19th century, when 1,309 immigrants arrived at Ellis Island between 1890 and 1900. A steady stream continued during the ensuing decades, especially during the Greek Civil War from 1944 to 1949. I am proud to represent the state of Michigan which boasts a large Greek-American community. 
   Greece, the birthplace of philosophy and of democracy, has given the world Plato and Aristotle, Homer and Sophocles. Greeks have brought their rich tradition to America, making our nation stronger. I join the Greek-American community in Michigan and throughout our nation in celebrating this anniversary of the modern revolution which brought freedom to the Greek people. 
   I take great pleasure in cosponsoring a resolution designating March 25, 1999 as ``Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy.''

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to honor an outstanding individual, Mother Geraldine Marvel Miller Wright, on the occasion of her birthday on Sunday, February 28, 1999. 
   Mother Geraldine Wright, the wife of one of the nation's most prominent Bishops, the Bishop Earl J. Wright, Sr., the mother of three children, Earl Jr., Michael and Marvie; has learned how to labor in the ministry standing beside her husband and helping him in the work. This task is not new to Mother Wright--her lineage is made up of a host of leaders. Her father was a Bishop, her brother is a Bishop, and she has a brother-in-law who is also a Bishop. 
   Mother Geraldine Wright is an extraordinary example of what one can achieve through tenacity and a giving and loving heart. Through her love for God, family, church, and others, Mother Wright has made an impact in the lives of many hurting people. She untiringly stands by her husband's side, she visits and ministers to the sick, encourages others, helps others, gives to others, prays for others, but most of all, she is a trainer and builder of others. Training individuals to love God and work for the Lord seems to be one very important aspect of her calling.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to address an issue crucial to the well-being of our troops, and crucial to the defense of our nation. For too long, this administration has ignored the needs of the brave men and women who defend our interests and our shores. This is unfair, and in my view it is unwise. 
   It is unfair that, as our colleague Senator MCCAIN has found, 11,000 military families are currently forced to rely on food stamps to make ends meet. When people put themselves in harm's way for their country, they should not have to go on public assistance to feed their families. 
   It is unwise because it ignores the well-being of our troops. Well-trained, properly motivated troops are the single most important factor in maintaining our national security. Without them we will not be able to achieve and maintain military readiness. We will not be able, as a nation, to fight and win. 
   Under current conditions, Mr. President, we cannot expect to maintain the levels of re-enlistment, expertise and morale we need to maintain an effective military force. Military pay is simply too low. It is not competitive with civilian pay. And this military-civilian pay gap is driving away the people we need to defend our nation. 
   For example, we lost 626 trained pilots in 1997 alone. Overall re-enlistments have been dropping fast. In 1997 fewer than half our troops completing their first tour of duty chose to re-enlist. 
   Mr. President, we cannot fly planes without pilots, just as we cannot deploy ships or tanks or any other military hardware without the soldiers and sailors who make them work. And if we cannot keep well-trained pilots, soldiers and sailors, we will face increased danger to our troops, or weaponry and our interests in any conflict. 
   Mr. President, our men and women in uniform have a history of making do, but we soon will not have enough of them to do the job of defending our nation and our interests in a dangerous world. 
   It is time to give our troops a raise. President Clinton has made a modest proposal on this issue but frankly it is too modest. It is, as they say, a day late and a dollar short. 
   That is why I was happy to join with Senator WARNER and 23 other Republicans in introducing the ``Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill Of Rights'' (S. 4). This measure is key to re-establishing the morale, experience and re-enlistment figures we need in our armed forces. 
   This legislation will increase FY 2000 pay by 4.8%. It will further increase pay in those grades where retention is critical. And it will provide a monthly allowance of $180 to all members of the uniformed services eligible for food stamps, eliminating their need to go on public assistance. 
   This legislation also will restore traditional military retirement pay and set up civilian-style thrift savings plans to encourage more men and women to make the military their career. 
   Finally, this legislation will address the increasing trouble our troops face in taking advantage of their GI Bill education benefits. The cost of higher education has skyrocketed, Mr. President, and GI Bill benefits have not kept pace. Thus a growing number of veterans are not making use of their education benefit, even though they have paid $1,200 to get it. 
   To address this situation, S.4 will eliminate the $1,200 contribution requirement. It also will increase the monthly GI Bill benefit from $528 to  $600 for members who serve at least 3 years, and from $429 to $488 for those serving less than 3 years. 
   We still have the greatest military in the world, Mr. President. I believe that it is time to pay a decent wage and provide decent benefits to the people who keep it that way. 
   This legislation includes a requirement that the Defense Department report annually on the impact of these programs on recruiting and retention, assuring that we can keep track of the needs of our troops. In doing so I am sure they in turn will be better able to see to the needs of their families and of their country. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the resolution before the Senate today requesting that the United States Postal Service issue a commemorative postage stamp for the 100th anniversary of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States will honor our veterans who have so courageously fought in every war, conflict, police action, and military intervention since the Spanish-American War in 1899. 
   Members of the VFW have helped millions of veterans secure the education, disability compensation, pension, and health care benefits that veterans are rightfully entitled to receive as a result of their military service. 
   With over 2 million members the VFW has also been deeply involved in community service projects designed to encourage service in the local community benefiting education, the environment, health services, civic pride, and community betterment. For example, the VFW's Voice of Democracy essay competition provides over $2.7 million in college scholarships annually to promising young students. The VFW's Safety Program conducts programs in home, auto, and bicycle safety, as well as programs dealing with drug awareness and substance abuse. Clearly, the VFW with over 10,000 posts continues to make valuable and significant contributions to our communities across the country. 
   In celebration of the 100th anniversary of the VFW I urge my colleagues to support this resolution to commemorate our veterans for their service.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my alma mater, Michigan State University, as their basketball program celebrates its centennial season. Over the course of the last century, Spartan basketball has been a tremendous source of pride for the Michigan State student body and its vast alumni network. A splendid representative of the Big Ten conference since 1951, MSU is one of the premier college basketball programs in the nation. MSU basketball has produced 45 NBA draft picks, among them some of the greatest players in the history of the game. 
   The many great teams and coaches that have graced the floor of the Jenison Field House and Breslin Center should be very proud of the tradition of excellence that they have built. The accomplishments of Michigan State's basketball program are tremendous: 15 First-Team All-Americans, seven Big Ten championships, four Big Ten players of the year, 12 NCAA Tournament appearances, and one National Championship. 
   I extend my warmest regards and best wishes to the 1998 National Coach of the Year, Tom Izzo, and all current Spartan players. I also applaud all past coaches, players, and supporters of Spartan Basketball's first one hundred years. I hope the next century is as exciting and successful as the first.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. In light of our time constraints, I would like to focus my remarks today primarily on the one issue--more than any other--that has arisen during our deliberations: namely, whether the President should be convicted if we find he committed the acts alleged in the Articles. 
   I believe this issue is not only central to the case at hand, it is also central to all future evaluations and applications of what we do here. 
   In arguing for the President, White House lawyers have asserted that the threshold for Presidential removal must be very high--and I agree. At the same time, however, we must remember that there is an inverse relationship between the level at which we set the removal bar and the degree of Presidential misconduct we will accept. 
   So, then, where do we set the bar? 
   As we know, the Constitution says: The President, Vice President, and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors. 
   Now it has been suggested by some that a ``high Crime'' must be a truly heinous crime. But that interpretation is obviously wrong. Treason is certainly among the most heinous crimes. But bribery is not. 
   Taking a bribe, like treason, is however, a uniquely serious act of misconduct by a public official. That suggests a different meaning for ``high Crime,'' one that is linked somehow to the fact that the person committing it holds public office. 
   Alexander Hamilton's comment about the impeachment power, quoted by so many of us here, provides the clue. In Federalist 65, Hamilton says: ``The subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the violation of some public trust.'' 
   The President's lawyers invoked this line, but in my view they misread it. They argued that what it means is that a President's conduct must involve misuse of official power if he is to be removed from office. 
   But that is not what the Constitution demands, or what Hamilton's comment, fairly read, suggests. Otherwise, as has been noted, we would have to leave in office a President or a federal judge who committed murder, so long as they did not use any powers of their office in doing so. 
   Rather, as Hamilton's language connotes, and our own precedents in the judicial impeachment cases confirm, the connection the Constitution requires between an official's actions and functions is a more practical one: the official's conduct must demonstrate that he or she cannot be trusted with the powers of the office in question. 
   This rule certainly encompasses official acts demonstrating unfitness for the office in question--but it also reaches beyond such acts. 
   In my view, we need not determine the outer limits of this principle to decide the question before us today: whether the President's actions, as alleged in these Articles, constitute a violation of a ``public trust'' as Hamilton uses the term. 
   The answer to that question is plain when we consider the President's conduct in relation to his responsibilities. 
   The President's role and status in our system of government are unique. The Constitution vests the executive power in the President, and in the President alone. That means he is the officer chiefly charged with carrying out our laws. Therefore, far more than any federal judge, he holds the scales of justice in his own hands. 
   In the wrong hands, that power can easily be transformed from the power to carry out the laws, into the power to bend them to one's own ends. 
   The very nature of the Presidency guarantees that its occupant will face daily temptations to twist the laws for personal gain, for party benefit or for the advantage of friends. 
   To combat these temptations, the Constitution spells out--in no uncertain terms--that the President shall  ``take care that the laws be faithfully executed,'' and the President's oath of office requires him to swear that he will do so. 
   If he obstructed justice and tampered with witnesses in the Jones case, a federal civil rights case in which he was the defendant, the President violated his oath and failed to perform the bedrock duty of his office. He did not faithfully execute the laws.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today with 14 of my Colleagues, including the Chairmen of the Senate Small Business, Commerce, Government Affairs and Budget Committees, as well as the Majority Leader, in introducing vital legislation in protecting our nation's businesses from ill-thought government mandates, The Mandates Information Act of 1999. This bill in my view furthers the cause of careful deliberation in this, the greatest deliberative body in the world. It will force Members of Congress to carefully consider all aspects of potential legislation containing mandates affecting consumers, workers, and small businesses. 
   We have been working towards final passage of this bill for quite some time, Mr. President, as we introduced very similar legislation in the last Congress. I wish to thank Chairmen THOMPSON and DOMENICI for their tireless leadership in shepherding this through their two Committees last Congress. I am only sorry we did not have sufficient time to bring it to the floor before adjournment. With their support and leadership in this Congress, I believe we can bring it to the floor for quick consideration and move to Conference with the House. 
   And too it is the House that I also wish to extend my thanks and respect. Under the careful leadership of Representatives PORTMAN and CONDIT, and the very helpful support of the Speaker, the House version of the Mandates Information Act, H.R. 350, easily passed the House on Wednesday with a broad, bipartisan majority of 274 to 194. Their conscientious sponsorship of the bill allowed it to quickly pass through Committee, and to avoid being watered down by unneeded amendments. I offer my thanks and respect for their efforts. 
   Mr. President, this is not a new idea, but one that builds upon the important work of the 104th Congress when we passed the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995. That legislation required the Congressional Budget Office to make two key estimates with respect to any bill reported out of committee: First, whether the bill contains intergovernmental mandates with an annual cost of $50 million or more; and, second, whether the bill contains private sector mandates with an annual cost of $100 million or more. The 1995 act also established a point of order against bills meeting the $50 million cost threshold for intergovernmental mandates. Although the point of order can be waived by a simple majority vote, it encourages Congress to think carefully before imposing new intergovernmental mandates. 
   The 1995 act did not apply its point of order to private sector mandates. This was understandable, given the bill's focus on intergovernmental mandates. But States and localities are not alone in being affected by Federal mandates. Consumers, workers, and small businesses also are affected when the Federal Government passes along the costs of its policies. This is why the Mandates Information Act of 1997 will apply a point of order to bills meeting the $100 million cost threshold for private sector mandates, while also directing the CBO to prepare a ``Consumer, Worker, and Small Business Impact Statement'' for any bill reported out of committee. 
   These reforms are necessary in my view, Mr. President, because the 1995 Act, while effective in its chosen sphere of intergovernmental mandates, does not contain the necessary mechanisms to force Congress to think seriously about the wisdom of proposed mandates on the private sector. This leaves our private sector faced with the same dilemma once faced by our States and localities: Congress does not give full consideration to the costs its mandates impose. Focusing almost exclusively on the benefits of unfunded mandates, Congress pays little heed to, and sometimes seems unaware of, the burden that unfunded mandates impose on the very groups they are supposed to help. 
   Unfunded mandate costs by definition do not show up on Congress' balance ledger. But, as President Clinton's Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers has written, ``[t]here is no sense in which benefits become `free' just because the government mandates'' them. Congress has merely passed the costs on to someone else. 
   And that ``someone'' is the American people. As economists from Princeton's Alan Krueger to John Holohan, Colin Winterbottom, and Sheila Zedlewski of the Urban Institute agree, the costs of unfunded mandates on the private sector are primarily borne by three groups: consumers, workers, and small businesses. 
   What forms do these costs take? For consumers, mandate costs take the form of higher prices for goods and services, as unfunded mandates drive up the cost of labor. 
   For workers, the costs of unfunded mandates often take the form of significantly lower wages. According to the Heritage Foundation, a range of independent studies indicates that some 88 percent of the cost of private sector mandates are shifted to workers in the form of lower wages. 
   And mandates can cause workers to lose their jobs altogether. Faced with uncontrollable increases in employee costs, our job creators too often find that they can no longer afford to retain their full complement of workers. The Clinton health care mandate, for example, would have resulted in a net loss of between 200,000-500,000 jobs, according to a study conducted by Professor Krueger. 
   Small businesses and their potential employees also suffer. Mandates typically apply only to businesses with at least a certain number of employees. As a result, small businesses have a powerful incentive not to hire enough new workers to reach the mandate threshold. As the Wall Street Journal recently noted, ``The point at which a new [mandate] kicks in.*.*.*.is the point at which the [Chief Financial Officer] asks `Why grow?' '' 
   That question is asked by small businesses all over the country, but let me cite one 
   example from my State. Hasselbring/Clark is an office equipment supplier in Lansing, MI. Noelle Clark is the firm's treasurer and secretary. Mindful of the raft of mandates whose threshold is 50 employees, Ms. Clark reports that lately ``we have hired a few temps to stay under 49.'' Thus, unfunded mandates not only eliminate jobs, but also prevent jobs from being created. 
   Much as Members of Congress may wish it were not so, mandates have a very real cost. This does not mean that  all mandates are bad. But it does mean that Congress should think very carefully about the wisdom of a proposed mandate before imposing it. 
   Such careful thinking, Mr. President, is the goal of the Mandates Information Act of 1999. Just as the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 protects State and local governments from hasty decisionmaking with respect to proposed intergovernmental mandates, the Mandates Information Act would protect consumers, workers, and small businesses from hasty decisionmaking with respect to proposed private sector mandates. It would do so, in essence, by extending the reforms of the 1995 act to private sector mandates. 
   The bill I introduce today would build on the 1995 act's reforms in two ways. First, to give Congress more complete information about the impact of proposed mandates on the private sector, my bill directs CBO to prepare a ``Consumer, Worker, and Small Business Impact Statement'' for any bill reported out of Committee. This statement would include analyses of the bill's private sector mandates' effects on the following: First, consumer prices and [the] actual supply of goods and services in consumer markets; second, worker wages, worker benefits, and employment opportunities; and third, the hiring practices, expansion, and profitability of businesses with 100 or fewer employees. 
   But providing Congress with more complete information about the impact of proposed private sector mandates will not guarantee that it pays any attention to it. This we know from experience. In 1981, Congress enacted the State and Local Government Cost Estimate Act, sponsored by Senator Sasser. Pursuant to that act, CBO provided Congress with estimates of the cost of intergovernmental mandates in bills reported out of committee. But Congress routinely ignored this information. It did so because the 1981 act had no enforcement mechanism to force Congress to consider the CBO estimates. As Senator Sasser himself explained in introducing a follow-up bill in 1993, ``[t]he problem [with the 1981 act], it has become clear, is that this yellow caution light has no red light to back it up.'' 
   To supply that ``red light,'' Senator Sasser's Mandate Funding Act of 1993 contained a point of order. Of course, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 likewise contained a point of order, which is why it succeeded where Senator Sasser's 1981 act had failed. 
   The Mandates Information Act of 1999 will provide this red light for proposed 
   private sector mandates. It contains a point of order against any bill whose direct private sector mandates exceed the $100 million threshold set by the 1995 act. Like the 1995 act's point of order against intergovernmental mandates, the 1997 bill's point of order can be waived by a simple majority of Members. Thus it will not stop Congress from passing bills it wants to pass. It is here, Mr. President, that I wish to thank Chairman THOMPSON and DOMENICI for the excellent revisions of the mandates language offered during the Government Affairs mark-up of the Mandates Information Act of 1997. We have incorporated those changes in this bill and believe they greatly strengthen the legislation, including making it very clear that the point of order only applies to direct mandates upon the private sector that exceed $100 million. 
   It is that point of order which will serve the vital purpose to ensure Congress does not ignore the information contained in the Consumer, Worker, and Small Business Impact Statement. It will do so by allowing any Member to focus the attention of the entire House or Senate on the impact statement for a particular bill. 
   The Mandates Information Act of 1999 will provide Congress with more complete information about proposed mandates' effects on consumers, workers, and small businesses. It will also ensure that Congress actually considers this information before reaching a judgment about whether to impose a new mandate. The result, Mr. President, will be focused, high-quality deliberation on the wisdom of private sector mandates. 
   Because of the success of the 1995 act, Congress is now much more careful to consider the interests of State and local governments in making decisions about unfunded mandates. But Congress must be just as careful to consider the interests of consumers, workers, and small businesses in making such decisions. This bill will ensure that care, helping produce better legislation; legislation that imposes a lighter burden on working Americans. 
   Mr. President, I will include in the RECORD the following sample of letters from small business groups supporting the bill along with a list of groups that have expressed their support for it. 
   Mr. President, the support for this legislation is broad and deep. It is needed to protect our small businesses against mandates which have not been fully analyzed and which harm these businesses in ways that Congress may never have intended. But, Mr. President, I believe they can best argue for the need for this bill.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. I concur with my colleagues. The development and production of alternative fuels provides a real opportunity for the country to improve the environment while ensuring a constant, reasonably priced fuel supply. But recent efforts to provide such assurances have been hampered. For example, in the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, Congress extended the placed-in-service date for facilities producing synthetic fuels from coal, and gas from biomass for eighteen months. 
   However, progress in bringing certain facilities up to full production has been hampered by the Administration's 1997 proposal to shorten the placed-in-service date and because, in many cases, the technology used to produce the fuels is new. Such delays have created uncertainty regarding the facilities eligibility under the placed-in-service requirement of section 29. 
   While it is important that the Congress consider again this issue in the 106th Congress, I would also urge the Secretary to consider the facilities I mentioned qualified under Section 29 if they met the Service's criteria for placed-in-service by June 30, 1998 whether or not such facilities were consistently producing commercial quantities of marketable products on a daily basis.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a group of very special young women from Calvin College. The Calvin College Women's Cross Country team placed first in the National Championships for Division III. This is the first national championship won by a MIAA (Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association) team in cross country. 
   The following 19 girls who make up the team, have indeed made Calvin College proud: Rashel Bayes, Erinn Boot, Kristi Brown, Lindsay Carrier, Andrea Clark, Allison Cook, Sara Crowe, April DeKorte, Kristie DeYoung, Sarah Gibson, Elisabeth Giessel, Sarah Gritter, Emily Hollender, Elizabeth Kuipers, Kris Lumkes, Amy Mizzone, Lisa Timmer, Candice Vandergriff, and Katherine VanDerSchaaf. I would also like to recognize Nancy Meyer, the coach of the women's cross country team, who was named the national cross country coach of the year. 
   The Calvin Women's Cross Country team has now earned 16 All-American berths in the history of its program and eight top-10 national team finishes. It is my pleasure, once again, to congratulate the Calvin College Women's Cross Country team. It is very encouraging to see these young women strive for such excellence. This team has made Calvin College and the entire state of Michigan very proud.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Walter Adams of East Lansing, Michigan. In the 76 years before his passing, Mr. Adams touched the lives of his family, his students, and his fellow community members with his passion for learning. Mr. Adams is best known for his longtime dedication to Michigan State University as a forty-six-year faculty member, including one year as president of the university. 
   As a lifelong promoter of education, Mr. Adams touched the lives of students and colleagues alike. He never lost his interest, his enthusiasm, and his total commitment to the ideals of education. His students were fortunate to be under the tutelage of an instructor who was knowledgeable, experienced, and committed to improving the knowledge of those he taught. Even after his retirement in 1993, Mr. Adams remained steadfastly loyal to the university. 
   As Americans, we owe a great deal to those individuals who choose to prepare future generations to lead this country. Mr. Adams was not only part of this group, he was one of its finest members. He will be remembered fondly by all those he guided and inspired.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in remembrance of Fayanne Kaufman of Farmington Hills, Michigan. In the 72 years before her passing, Mrs. Kaufman touched the lives of her family, her students, and her fellow community members with her passion for life and learning. 
   Mrs. Kaufman responded to life's challenges with strength and optimism. After her husband's untimely death in 1965, she joined the ranks of older Americans pursuing higher education and attained her teaching degree at Wayne State University. In 1968, she began a 30-year career in the Farmington Public Schools, teaching at both the middle and high school levels. A renowned artist in the fields of ceramics and jewelry making, Mrs. Kaufman encouraged her students to develop their talents and helped them receive scholarships at various art and design institutions throughout the United States. In addition, she inspired and worked with troubled students to turn their lives around. Mrs. Kaufman remained active with her alma mater over the years as an alumnus and was honored by the university with the Woman of Wayne State Award. In the past decade, she strengthened her commitment to public service with three bids for the Michigan Board of Education. 
   Most importantly, Mrs. Kaufman was a devoted mother to her three sons. She raised her children to appreciate the importance of education and community service. As her son Jerry said, ``She was amazing and had such a warm sweet spirit.'' Mrs. Kaufman inspired us all to serve our community to the best of our ability and reassured us that we all can have a positive impact on the world around us. I wish to extend best wishes to the entire Kaufman family.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Woodrow Dawson, Jr. of Southfield, Michigan. On December 31, 1998, after 25 years of service, Mr. Dawson retired from Ford Motor Company, Dearborn Glass. His dedication to an industry that is historically and economically significant to our state is highly commendable. It is people like Mr. Dawson who contribute to the great productivity of our nation. 
   In addition to his hard work with Ford, Mr. Dawson is a committed member of his community. He is an elder at St. Paul Church of God in Christ in Detroit, which he has attended for 50 years. Even more importantly, he is a devoted husband to his wife of 31 years and father to four children. I extend my warmest wishes and the best of luck for the future to Mr. Dawson and his family.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Recognition Act of 1999. This legislation will correct an unfortunate oversight that has left the federal holiday recognizing our great civil rights leader without the full ceremonial status it deserves. This is an injustice to a great leader and one I hope the Senate will act to correct as soon as possible. 
   Mr. President, federal holidays celebrating the birthdays of great Americans have traditionally included celebratory signs of respect. In particular, they have been on the list of days on which the American flag should be flown nationwide. Yet, across this country, in the schools and on the streets that bear the name of Martin Luther King, Jr., that flag has not been flown to commemorate his holiday. 
   Dr. King, minister, civil rights leader, winner of the Nobel Prize for his nonviolent resistance to segregation, has been recognized around the world as a pivotal figure in American history and in the global struggle for civil rights. He was instrumental in putting an end to segregation and to putting issues of racial equality and civil rights into the forefront of American public life. 
   As a nation we have recognized the importance of Dr. King's efforts and of his achievement by instituting celebration of a federal holiday in his honor. It is time to complete that recognition by adding Dr. King's holiday to the list of days on which the American flag should be flown nationwide. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to St. Paul's Episcopal Church of Lansing, Michigan, and its members who are currently celebrating its 150th Anniversary. The congregation can be proud of the founding members' faith and devotion which brought about the organization of this church in 1849. 
   Members of St. Paul's Church met in Michigan's Capitol building for a decade until the continued growth of the congregation required that a separate building be constructed. Further growth necessitated the completion of a newer church in 1873, and again in 1914. As our country begins to rediscover the importance of family and personal values, the building of faith by St. Paul's Episcopal Church is of great significance to us all. 
   I extend my warmest regards and best wishes to all of the members of St. Paul's congregation as they celebrate this great achievement.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor of the ``States' Rights Protection Act of 1999.'' This legislation will prevent a grave injustice that could do significant damage to our states, and to our federal system. 
   Several years ago, Mr. President, a number of states commenced lawsuits against American tobacco companies. The states sought damages on the basis of a number of claims, including violation of consumer fraud and other State consumer protection laws, antitrust violations and unjust enrichment. Some suits included claims for tobacco-related health care costs incurred by the states, and some did not. 
   Eventually all 50 states became parties in one way or another to anti-tobacco lawsuits. Last November a major settlement was reached, involving 46 states. That settlement included no funds of any kind to be allocated for State medicaid costs. 
   The federal government in Washington did not initiate these suits. The federal government in Washington provided no financial assistance to the states in furtherance of their suits. Yet now, after the states and the tobacco companies have agreed on a financial settlement, the Clinton Administration is seeking to divert a significant portion of that settlement to its own use. 
   The federal Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) has stated that it wants to ``recoup'' some of the states' settlement funds. They claim to have a right to these funds under a Medicaid law which the federal government has traditionally used to recover its share of ``overpayments.'' These overpayments typically arise when providers overbill Medicaid. 
   Mr. President, HCFA's claims cannot stand. The law to which they refer was intended to prevent fraud and other forms of overbilling. It was not intended to allow the federal government to seize huge amounts of money to which it has no proper title. States have obtained a legal right to this money. They gained this right through a properly constructed and affirmed legal settlement of lawsuits filed against product manufacturers, on behalf of all their residents, asserting a consumer protection and various other causes of action. 
   There is no federal medical claim involved. Thus HCFA has no right to these monies, and neither does any agency of the federal government. 
   The Administration's pursuit of monies from this settlement amounts to nothing more or less than a raw assertion of federal power. We must oppose it for the good of our states and for the good of our form of limited, federal government. 
   Ours is a limited government, Mr. President. It is limited in that the Constitution delegates only certain powers to the federal branches and their officials. Our Constitution includes a number of what James Madison called ``auxiliary precautions'' to keep federal officials within their proper bounds, thereby protecting our liberties. But Madison recognized that the primary check on those who would overstep their proper bounds must be the determination of elected officials to see that the Constitution's terms are respected. 
   A federal government that simply steps in to take money from the states is not respecting our Constitution. That federal government is taking us far down a 
   dangerous path toward unrestrained central power. We must see that this does not happen. 
   In addition, Mr. President, as a practical matter it would be a mistake to allow the federal government to commandeer these funds. To begin with, were the federal government in Washington to take these funds from the states under the weak legal pretense put forward by the HCFA, the result would be long, wasteful litigation. That litigation will benefit no one, instead it will poison intergovernmental relations for years to come. 
   Indeed, if the HCFA begins to seize state settlement funds, it will do so by cutting federal Medicaid payments to the states. This will make it much more difficult for states to provide health care for children from low and moderate income families, the disabled and millions of others who depend on Medicaid. The real victims of this  money grab will be the weakest members of our society, those least able to take care of themselves. 
   Of course, the Administration claims that it will use the states' money to benefit everyone. It seeks to take $18.9 billion of the states' money over the next five years. No doubt the Administration will find attractive programs on which to spend this money. But the federal government already consumes more than 20 percent of our national income. We do not need yet another federal tax and spend policy. 
   As a nation what we need is more innovative policy making at the state and local level. And that is what these monies will produce, if only we will leave them in their proper place. 
   A number of states already have acted in reliance on the tobacco settlement, putting forward proposals and new programs that will greatly benefit their people. 
   For example, in my state of Michigan, Governor John Engler in his state of the state address a few short weeks ago proposed to endow a Michigan Merit Award Trust Fund with Michigan's share of the tobacco settlement. 
   Under this program, every Michigan high school graduate who masters reading, writing, math and science will receive a Michigan Merit Award--a $2,500 scholarship that can be used for further study at a Michigan school of that student's choice. 
   In addition, all Michigan students who pass the 7th and 8th grade tests in reading, writing, math and science administered by the state will be awarded $500. That means, Mr. President, that any Michigan student successfully completing secondary schooling will receive $3,000 for further education. 
   The young people of Michigan will benefit tremendously from this program, Mr. President. Their motivation to do well in school will be significantly increased, as will their ability to afford and succeed in higher education. 
   We need programs like Michigan's to help kids do well in school and get ahead in life. The federal government should be learning from these kinds of programs and working to show other states how well they can work. It should not be taking money out of the pockets of Michigan's young people to put into the pockets of Washington bureaucrats. 
   We must protect the rights and the people of our states by seeing to it that tobacco settlement money stays where it belongs, and where it will do the most good--in the states. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Georgia. 
   I wish to join my colleagues in expressing our deep concern at this administration's misleading and potentially damaging budget. 
   Now that we have finally gotten our fiscal house in order, turning huge deficits into significant surpluses, I am troubled, as a lot of our colleagues are, that the administration is seeking to turn the clock back to the bad old days of tax and spend that got us in financial trouble in the first place. 
   I think the Senator from Missouri very effectively outlined some of the inadequacies of this budget. 
   This budget includes $1.7 trillion in new Government spending, with the potential of trillions more, despite the President's agreement to set budget caps. And despite the President's frequent calls to save Social Security first, it does nothing to save this crucial program. 
   Finally, this budget includes no significant tax cut for the hard-working American families who brought us out of the age of deficits and into the present age of surplus. With the $4.5 trillion in anticipated surpluses, this administration could not find--in its budget, or in its heart--the wherewithal to give anything back to the American people, and that, Mr. President, is simply shameful. 
   I know my colleagues and I will be speaking a great deal in the coming weeks about the need for tax cuts, and I know the Presiding Officer will be one of those speaking often about this topic. But today, I want to focus on one particular aspect of the President's budget that would do great damage to our system of Government and to our States, my State of Michigan in particular. 
   Last November, 46 States and the tobacco companies reached a settlement in their long-running litigation. The Federal Government neither initiated nor helped the States financially in these suits. Yet now, the Clinton administration wants to divert $18.9 billion of the settlement to its own uses. 
   The Federal Health Care Financing Administration, HCFA, wants to seize this money under legislation allowing it to recoup Medicaid overpayments. But no Medicaid moneys were allocated under the tobacco settlement. This seizure is a raw exercise of Federal power, dangerous to our liberties and our form of Government. 
   In addition, the administration's actions promise costly litigation and first hits those least able to fend for themselves: State Medicaid patients whose funding would be seized by HCFA. 
   Of course, the administration claims that it will use the State's moneys to benefit everybody. Once again, this administration believes it is better able to spend money than are those actually entitled to it; in this case, the States. 
   A number of States already have acted in reliance on the tobacco settlement, putting forward proposals that will greatly benefit their constituents. For example, in my State of Michigan, Governor John Engler has proposed to endow a merit award trust fund with Michigan's share of the settlement, at least a portion of that settlement. 
   Under this program, every Michigan high school graduate who masters reading, writing, math, and science will receive a Michigan merit award, a $2,500 scholarship that can be used for further study at a Michigan school of that student's choice. Another $500 would be available for seventh and eighth grade students who pass their State tests, bringing the total available for higher education in Michigan to $3,000 for students who work hard and learn the basic skills needed to move on to higher education. 
   We need programs like Michigan's to help kids do well in school and get ahead in life. The Federal Government should be learning from these kinds of programs. It should not be taking money out of the pockets of Michigan's young people to put into the pockets of Washington bureaucrats. 
   We must protect the rights and the people of our States by seeing to it the tobacco settlement money stays where it belongs and where it will do the most good--in the States. 
   That, Mr. President, is, in my judgment, one of the many inadequacies in the President's budget. I certainly intend to work very hard here in the months ahead to make sure these tobacco settlement dollars go to the States where the priorities can be set that make the most sense to the people of the States. They are the ones who fought this litigation and won it. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the motion offered in the Court of Impeachment to dismiss the Articles of Impeachment against President Clinton. To support the motion would undermine the precedents and history of the impeachment process laid out in the Constitution. To my knowledge, the only instances in our history that the Senate has dismissed a Resolution of Impeachment without voting up or down on at least one of the Articles sent over by the House was when the impeached officer resigned before the Senate had the opportunity to act. I do not think we should deviate from our precedents on this occasion. 
   In voting on the motion to dismiss, we are supposed to assume that even if the President did everything the House claims he did, we should still dismiss the Articles. So for purposes of this motion, we have to assume that he committed every act of obstruction of justice and witness tampering the House has claimed and every instance of perjury before the grand jury that the House claims. This would include  perjury before a grand jury sitting to help the Congress determine whether the President committed impeachable offenses. 
   Mr. President, I have by no means decided whether President Clinton has done everything the House alleges. But if I am to assume all these allegations are correct, I cannot see how in good conscience I can support the motion to dismiss and permit the President to stay in office.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, there is a lot about this impeachment process that is new and unfamiliar to all of us. That is all the more reason why we should allow ourselves to be guided by the Constitution and historical precedents in deciding how we proceed. The Constitution's requirement that the Senate ``shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments.'' certainly suggests that the Senate will ordinarily do more than simply look at the record made by the House in deciding whether to send us Articles of impeachment, and that has generally been the Senate's practice. 
   Moreover, the Senate sitting as a court of impeachment is charged with seeking the truth in this trial. If any Senators reasonably believe that hearing witnesses would assist in finding the truth, then I believe both the President and the House should have the opportunity to call witnesses. Based on the record before us and the arguments we have heard, it is clear that at least on some of the House's charges, there are factual issues in dispute that the witnesses whom this motion proposes to subpoena for depositions could help us resolve. 
   It is for this reason, Mr. President, that I support the motion to allow both sides to depose these three witnesses. I do not see why this limited discovery should in any way cause this matter to be drawn out for any extended period of time. Rather, I believe it can be conducted very expeditiously without in any way jeopardizing the Senate's ability to conduct other important legislative business.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Roy C. Howes as he celebrates his retirement on January 30, 1999, from the Manistee County Board of Commissioners after forty-five years of service. 
   Mr. Howes possesses a unique dedication to his community evidenced by his remarkable history of achievements. Since his first term as county commissioner in the 1950's, he has witnessed first hand the dramatic changes in county government and has helped prepare Manistee County for the new millennium. Most notably, Mr. Howes drew upon his experience as a forest farmer and timber operator to institute proper forest management techniques leading to increased county revenue. 
   In addition to his position as county commissioner, Mr. Howes served on the Michigan Association of Township Supervisors for almost a decade, as well as the state committee that drafted a new Michigan constitution. It was his desire to help older citizens with social security and income tax issues that prompted his initial interest in politics. Mr. Howes continues his good work today by assisting disabled children and students in need of loans as chairman of the board of directors for the Michigan Rural Rehabilitation Corporation. 
   It is with great admiration that I salute Mr. Howes' contributions to Manistee County and the entire state of Michigan. His work inspires us all to serve to the best of our ability and reassures us that each individual can positively impact his community. I wish Mr. Howes the best of luck for his future.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today, I, along with my colleagues Senators COVERDELL, HUTCHINSON, and  SESSIONS introduced the ``Faith-Based Drug Treatment Enhancement Act.'' The purpose of this legislation is to make successful faith-based drug and alcohol treatment programs eligible for federal substance abuse treatment dollars. It will allow faith-based programs to stand on an equal footing with other treatment programs which receive federal aid, allowing them to compete for federal funds without changing the religious nature of the help they provide. This is important because it is the religious character of the program to which program recipients often point as the reason for their success in overcoming their addiction. 
   Many faith-based treatment centers have astounding treatment success rates, particularly when compared with the single-digit success rates of many government-sponsored secular programs. One faith-based organization, the Mel Trotter Ministry, is located in my state of Michigan. This ministry points to the accountability demanded of addicts entering its faith-based program as a reason for its success. Another contributing factor to Mel Trotter's astounding 70 percent success rate is the program's ability to provide recipients with an incentive to change. The drug addict finds a new life at Mel Trotter Ministries and is finally able to overcome his or her addiction. 
   A similar program in my state, the Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries, boasts a 78 percent success rate for its substance abuse programs. One of the program recipients describes his experience at Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries this way: ``I was in and out of jail. During the winter of 1995, I was exposed to arctic cold with a resulting case of frostbite so severe I was threatened with amputation. Released from probation for the sixth time, I found Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries' Oasis shelter on Woodward Avenue and stayed 22 nights. There I found more than a shelter--I found a relationship with God and a new life of service for Him.'' 
   Mel Trotter Ministry and Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries are examples of substance abuse treatment programs with proven success records. These programs and programs like them should be allowed to provide the crucial assistance needed for individuals to overcome their substance abuse once and for all. 
   This legislation builds on the charitable choice provision Senator ASHCROFT fought to have included in the historic welfare reform bill. That provision allows faith based charities to contract with government to supply social services without having to give up their religious character. No longer will religious groups have to literally hide the Bibles in order to help people. 
   Where sterile, bureaucratic government run programs fail, faith based programs can succeed, and are succeeding already. I urge my colleagues to support these efforts by supporting this legislation.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues' support for The Adoption Promotion Act. This legislation will work to provide important information on adoption to women facing unplanned pregnancies. 
   Mr. President, each year more than a million couples eagerly await the opportunity to adopt a child. Unfortunately, only 50,000 domestic, non-related adoptions occur each year. Couples waiting to adopt are willing and able to provide loving homes. Some of them have for one reason or another found themselves incapable of having children of their own. Others simply wish to share their lives and their homes with another child. Every one of them could nurture and give a good upbringing to whatever youngster is lucky enough to get them as parents. Unfortunately, the would-be parents often must wait several years for the opportunity to adopt a healthy child. For the anxious parents, the waiting seems to last an eternity. 
   There are many reasons for the sharp disparity between the relatively limited number of children available for adoption and the growing number of families anxiously waiting to adopt a child. Crucial is the fact that many women are not provided adequate information about adoption when they are making the important decision of how to deal with an unexpected pregnancy. Too few women are fully informed concerning the adoption option. 
   We know that providing information to women on adoption as a choice can increase the number of adoptions that occur each year and decrease the number of abortions. I believe that this is an important goal. For this reason, I have introduced, along with my colleague, Senator LANDRIEU, legislation that authorizes an Adoption Promotion program. This program will provide $25 million in grants to be used for adoption promotion activity. It will also require recipients to contribute $25 million of in-kind donations. The total amount going to adoption promotion will, therefore, be $50 million. This amount will allow for a thorough information campaign to take place--reaching women all over the country. 
   The legislation provides for grants to be used for public service announcements on print, radio, TV, and billboards. Grants will also be provided for the development and distribution of brochures regarding adoption through federally funded Title X clinics. These provisions will enable women to have accurate and clear information on adoption as an alternative when at a crucial point in their pregnancies. Further, the campaign will help to raise the level of awareness around the country about the importance of adoption. 
   Mr. President, I believe that each and every one of us, whether pro-life or pro-choice, should be working to reduce the number of abortions that occur each year. Indeed, I have often heard on this floor that abortion should be ``safe, legal and rare.'' I take my colleagues at their word and urge them to join me in this voluntary information program; a program designed to inform women of all their choices regarding any unexpected pregnancy. 
   Too many women in America feel abandoned and helpless in the face of an unexpected pregnancy. The father of the child may have left, the woman's family and friends even may desert her. Even those who stay with her may simply pressure her to end an embarrassing and troublesome situation. 
   Too often, then, our women, in a vulnerable state, are left without full, unbiased information and guidance concerning their options. I think it is crucial in these circumstances that we keep these women fully informed of all their options--including the option of releasing their child into the arms of a welcoming couple, anxious to become loving parents. 
   If we truly are committed to making every child a wanted child, Mr. President, I believe it is our duty to see to it that pregnant women know that there are couples out there who would love to care for their children. It is time for us, as a nation, to make clear our commitment to truly full information for expectant mothers, information that includes the availability of safe, loving homes for their children.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise to address the topic of steel imports. The dramatic reduction in the price of imported steel poses a significant challenge to America's steel industry. In the first ten months of 1998 alone (October is the last month for which figures are available), Japan more than doubled the level of imports compared to their year-end total for all of 1997. Japan's 882,000 net tons imported in October appears to be an all-time monthly record. However, Japan is not solely responsible for the surge in imports. The total October 1998 steel import level was the second highest monthly total ever, with over 4.1 million net tons--an increase of 56% over October 1997 levels. 
   Earlier this month, a representative of the United Steelworkers of America union claimed that 5,000 steelworkers had already received layoff notices and another 20,000 were working reduced hours because of these imports. More recent reports indicate the number of laid-off workers is fast approaching 10,000. The American Iron and Steel Institute recently released figures which demonstrate that U.S. domestic steel production had been nearly decimated by the unprecedented surge in imports. In November 1998, U.S. steel mills shipped approximately 7.4 million net tons. This represents a decrease of 12.8% from the roughly 8.5 million net tons shipped the previous November. Of even more concern is that November 1998 shipments were down 10.6% just from the previous month! And as the import figures outlined above indicate, the magnitude of the situation is growing, not diminishing. 
   Mr. President, there are several factors behind this surge in low-priced steel imports. First, the general deflationary trends in the global economy have caused all commodity prices--including steel prices--to plummet. In my judgment, the Federal Reserve's tight monetary policy in 1997 and most of 1998 is to blame. While the Fed has taken corrective action to reduce short-term interest rates in recent months, commodity prices have yet to rebound. Second, the economic crisis in Asia and Russia has forced these countries to rely almost exclusively on exports to keep their economies afloat. Given the size of our manufacturing sector and our comparatively robust economic climate, the United States is an obvious, attractive export target for these nations. In many instances, the International Monetary Fund is to blame because it convinced these countries to either raise interest rates or devalue their currencies, which in turn allowed foreign steel to undercut American steel prices. 
   Against this macroeconomic backdrop of generally falling prices, some foreign steel companies may have engaged in the practice of ``dumping''--that is, selling steel below the cost of production. While we are eager to offer economic assistance to these struggling countries--and in many cases we have offered direct and indirect economic assistance to them--there is no reason we should have to compromise or ignore our trade laws. 
   So the question that confronts us today is: What do we--the Administration, the Congress--do about this serious problem? The Administration's lack of decisive action reportedly is due to their not wanting to risk subjecting the fragile economies in Asia, Russia and Brazil to further challenges. However, our willingness to assist our allies and trading partners ought not translate into requiring us to ignore unfair trading practices--and our own trade laws--or deleterious effects these practices have on our workers and domestic industry. 
   On the macroeconomic level, the Federal Reserve should focus on achieving price stability--and that means addressing deflation as well as inflation. The Clinton Administration must take decisive action on this matter quickly. Promising to talk to our trading partners in the hope of getting their cooperation in cutting back the import levels is not sufficient at this late date. In the international arena, the Administration must be exert more leadership in arguing against currency devaluations. In the trade arena, the Administration must take firm action in enforcing our anti-dumping laws. 
   To this end, I have cosponsored S. 61, a bill introduced yesterday by Senator DEWINE, that would eliminate existing disincentives for fair trade in our trade laws. Specifically, under current trade law, duties and fines imposed on those engaged in dumping go directly to the U.S Treasury. However, under the DEWINE bill, the duties or fines collected would be transferred to the affected industries, not to the U.S. Treasury. Therefore, continuation of unfair trade practices would result in the perpetrators of such activities effectively financially aiding their U.S. competitors. 
   It is important to note that this legislation does not create new duties or penalties, nor does it increase existing duties or penalties. Frankly, this legislation will not mandate that importers raise the price of steel one single penny, and therefore, it should not directly affect the market for underpriced steel. However, in the long run, producers who engage in dumping will have to seriously rethink their unfair trade practices. Because by continuing such practices, they only succeed in subsidizing those among our domestic industries that are being hurt by their illegal actions. 
   Mr. President, the recent surge in imported steel and the resulting job loss and scaled back production at U.S. steel plants may be a demonstration that current law does not effectively discourage unfair trade practices such as these. I have long been an ardent supporter of free and open trade. However, my support of free trade is prefaced on the notion that our trading partners will not engage in unfair trading practices, such as dumping, and that when our Nation is confronted by unfair trading practices, we will seek remedy, whether by invoking provisions in our own trade laws designed to combat such unfair trade practices or pursuing means of redress through international trade tribunals such as the World Trading Organization. 
   As long as our trade laws prohibit dumping, it is imperative for the Administration to adhere to them and to implement them where and when the circumstances require it. To fail to do so will have consequences, both for American workers and industry and for the principle of free trade that I believe is so important. More and more steel workers may be laid off and steel plants may begin to shut down. Our domestic steel industry, which has done so much over the last two decades to modernize and become competitive on an international basis, could become irreparably harmed. 
   If things deteriorate, we will see calls for quotas on steel imports. We will also see a political backlash against free trade, just at the time when we should be entering into free trade agreements with some of these very regions--Asia, Pacific Rim, and South America. This will only serve to set us back further from being the dominant player on the global marketplace in the next century. 
   Finally, let me pay tribute to the individuals and groups that have travelled all the way to Washington, D.C. to attend today's ``Stand Up for Steel'' rally. These people are here to raise our consciousness about the steel import situation. In my office alone, we have already received an estimated 15,000 letters on this issue. My constituents are rightly concerned by the situation. It is my hope that after attending the rally held at the Capitol this afternoon and after learning of  legislation being introduced by interested Senators, such as S. 61, that these people will return home knowing that we in Congress are not ignorant of this crisis or of their concern.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Georgia for organizing today's presentation. 
   As he has already outlined, yesterday we on the Republican side offered an agenda which we think includes the key cornerstones for strengthening our Nation and moving forward into the 21st century. I am not going to talk about every one of those. I would like to address a couple of them, though, briefly, because I think it is very important for the public to understand exactly why these are at the top of our list. 
   First, I want to talk about tax relief. As we learned last night from the State of the Union--and the Budget Committee hearing in the Senate has recently indicated--not only did last year mark the first time since 1969 that we ran a budget surplus, but it now appears as if we will run budget surpluses for the next 25 years, and potentially beyond. 
   That is great news for our country. I think--I hope, at least--that it will address some of the cynicism that has existed in America towards the U.S. Congress because for so many years, no matter what we were claiming in our campaigns, we would come to the Senate and the House and not get the job done. But we have gotten the job done. 
   Today, Americans are sending sufficient revenues so we have a surplus. That is going to be a very big surplus. In fact, it may be as much as multitrillion dollars of surplus over the next 10, 20, 25 years and beyond. The reason we have the surplus is in large measure--in fact, almost exclusively--because of two things: No. 1, our ability here in Washington to tighten belts with respect to some spending programs in recent years; and, much more importantly, the fact that American taxpayers are sending more money to Washington in tax revenue than we anticipated when we put in place the budget that we are working with today. 
   Mr. President, obviously part of that is the result of the economy's strength, and it is thriving. But if the American taxpayers are sending more money to Washington than we even expected, than we even asked them for, and that they should be spending, it seems to me obvious that the time is here to let them keep some of those dollars that we didn't even ask for in the first place. 
   So for that reason, the Republican agenda includes in every one of its key components an across-the-board tax cut for hard-working American families. 
   We heard people say, ``Well, we shouldn't do a tax cut; we have so many other things to get done first.'' When we had a budget deficit, we were told we couldn't cut taxes now, that we have a deficit. Now we have a budget surplus and it is projected to go for 25 years. 
   I would suggest that no matter what today's agenda items are that deserve priority over tax cuts, there will always be more. There will always be a new program, there will always be an old program, there will always be some rainy day down the road we are worried about, and the taxpayers consistently are told no, no, no, the time is not ripe yet for a tax cut. Well, I say it is. I think the families who are sending us the largest percentage of the GDP that we have ever seen sent to Washington in history deserve to keep some of those dollars and set their own priorities. And for that reason, we propose an across-the-board tax cut. 
   We also believe that the families of America deserve protection in another sense. Here in this Chamber we ought to talk about children and the problems and the challenges that confront them and our desire to have policies that will protect the young people of America. 
   The one thing we have to protect them against, in my judgment, and continue protecting them against, is the scourge of illegal drugs that continues to take an unhealthy and an increasing toll on young people. 
   Over the last few years, the drug statistics have suggested that there has been a leveling out of the drug use in this country, that we may have at least peaked, and it may be even getting better a little bit. But the one area where we are not seeing improvement is with respect to the use of drugs by kids, kids as young as eighth grade, some even younger than that.  
   Now, our drug plan, which is the second cornerstone of this agenda, will help us to achieve the goal of protecting our kids from these illegal drugs. It will include a wide array, a wide focus of programs, from interdiction on the one hand to treatment and prevention on the other. 
   But a centerpiece that I want to briefly discuss before my time expires is that this proposal of ours provides tough sentences for the people who peddle drugs to our kids. The message we have to send to drug dealers and the symbol we have to set for kids in America is that the price of doing business in drugs is going up, not down. Now, this is an area where there is some disagreement between our legislation and the administration. 
   I ask for an additional minute.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. In the last Congress, the U.S. Sentencing Commission put forth a proposal, embraced by the administration and the Department of Justice and the President, that would address this issue in what I consider to be the wrong fashion. That proposal suggests that because there is a wide difference between the drug sentences that powder cocaine dealers receive and the sentence that crack cocaine dealers receive, we ought to bring them more in line with each other by making the sentences on crack cocaine dealers more lenient. 
   That is the wrong way to proceed, Mr. President. And our legislation goes at it the right way, by making the sentences meted out to people who sell powder cocaine tougher. That is an important part of this legislation, not only because we need to make those sentences tougher, because we don't want people at the top of the drug chain to be getting lighter sentences than those at the bottom. But it is also important because it is critical that we send a signal that we are not going to make anybody's drug sentences, if they are peddling crack cocaine to our kids, any lighter. 
   This is important for a variety of reasons that I have spoken about here before, but I think it demonstrates the seriousness of the Republican proposal. And taken as a whole, that proposal, I believe, will have a tremendous impact on reducing the use of illegal drugs in this country and, most specifically, reducing the use of illegal drugs by young people. 
   So for these reasons, I am very proud to endorse this agenda, and I will be working as a cosponsor on a number of these bills. I believe we can pass them in this Congress. I think we saw yesterday in the introduction of these bills the makings of the kind of solid foundation, as I said, the cornerstone for success, as we move our country to the 21st century. 
   So I want to thank Senator COVERDELL again for having put together today's special order. I look forward to working with him and under his leadership on a number of these issues, and I thank the Chair for allowing me a chance to proceed here today.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues' support for important legislation introduced by Senator FRIST and WYDEN, the Education Flexibility Act. This legislation would expand the popular ``Ed-Flex'' program to all 50 states. Currently, 12 states, including Michigan, participate in the program. 
   Through the ``Ed-Flex'' program, the Department of Education delegates to the states its power to grant individual school districts temporary waivers from certain federal requirements if those requirements interfere with state and local efforts to improve education. To be eligible, a State must be able to waive its own regulations on schools. The State must hold schools accountable for results by setting academic standards and measuring student performance, requiring schools to publish school report cards, and intervening in low performance schools. This program does a great deal to reduce the regulatory burden for states trying to improve the education it provides to its citizens. 
   This program has been a tremendous success in Michigan. The first benefit came to Michigan in simply applying for the program. It was during this process that the Governor's office realized it did not meet the two criteria necessary to apply for the waiver because the state could not waive its own regulations. As a result, the Governor's office worked with the State legislature and State Board of Education to prepare and obtain this authority. Another benefit of the ``Ed-Flex'' program came when the state put in place the Waiver Referent Group. This group is made up of representatives from the Department, local and intermediate school districts, private schools, parent organizations, advisory and professional groups, and business/community members. Through this collaboration, the State will receive input on potential regulations that may help reduce barriers to reform from the people most closely associated with the regulations that are hindering their ability to achieve real and lasting reform. 
   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this important legislation. I am confident that the ``Ed-Flex'' program will be as valuable of a tool to education reform for other states as it has been to Michigan's education reform efforts.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues' support for the Collegiate Learning and Student Savings, or ``CLASS,'' Act. This legislation will help Americans as they seek to secure, for themselves and for their children, the increased opportunity and earnings potential available only to college graduates in this country. 
   Mr. President, America is the land of opportunity. But that opportunity comes at a price. More and more that price comes in the form of an increasing cost of a college education. College graduates on average earn 40 percent more than do those who have not graduated from college. But the increased opportunity college provides keeps getting more and more expensive. 
   College costs have risen dramatically--5 to 6 percent every year over the past decade. According to the College Board, the average annual cost for tuition, room and board at a public university is now $7,472. At a private college the cost is a whopping $19,213 per year. 
   If costs continue rising as they have been, a four-year college education will cost $75,000 at a public university and $250,000 at a private college by the time the average newborn begins attending in 2016. 
   Costs like these can send families deeply into debt. American families have already accrued more college debt in the 1990's than during the 1960's, 1970's, and 1980's combined. Yet, according to a 1997 poll conducted for the Student Loan Marketing Association, only about 18 percent of families start saving for college before their child begins high school. 
   Why aren't more families saving for their children's college education? Clearly one important reason is the fact that Washington subsidizes student debt while penalizing savings. Student loans are offered at low, federally subsidized rates in order to help more kids afford college. But families that try to save in advance for college face a situation in which their income is taxed before it goes into a savings account, and the interest they earn on their education savings are then taxed again every year. It is time for Washington to stop punishing working families for planning ahead for their children's future. It is time to help middle class kids and their parents afford a college education. 
   Mr. President, this is why The Collegiate Learning and Student Savings, or ``CLASS,'' Act is so important. This legislation will help more than 2.5 million students afford a college education. It would extend tax-free treatment to prepaid tuition plans sponsored by States and private institutions. 
   Currently, 39 States, including my own State of Michigan, have prepaid tuition plans that allow parents to save for their children's college education. Now, a nationwide consortium of more than 100 private schools, in 32 different States, have launched a similar plan. 
   These plans overwhelmingly benefit working, middle income families. For example, families with an annual income of less than $35,000 purchased 62 percent of the prepaid tuition contracts sold by Pennsylvania in 1996. In Kentucky, the average monthly contribution to a family's college savings account was $43 in 1995. 
   By making all of these plans tax-free, we can help families afford the ever-increasing cost of a college education. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues Senators GRAMS and ROTH in introducing S. 3, the Tax Cut for All Americans Act. This legislation will provide every American taxpayer with substantial tax relief by cutting all income tax rates 10 percent across the board, effective January first of this year. 
   American working families need this tax cut, Mr. President. They are now taxed at a higher rate than at any time since World War II. Not even at the height of the Vietnam War have the American people seen such a large part of their pay taken away from them in the form of taxes. 
   Since the current Administration came into office in 1993, federal taxes have gone up by over 35 percent, or over $600 billion. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation recently told us what these sky-high taxes mean to the typical American family. First, they mean that the typical family now pays more in total taxes than it spends on food, clothing and shelter combined--spending more than 38 percent on taxes and only 28 percent on food, clothing and housing. 
   Second, the typical American now works nearly three hours out of an eight hour day just to pay taxes. That American works from January 1 to May 10, the latest day ever, before he or she stops working for the government and starts working for him or herself.  
   Washington currently takes 21 percent of the national income in taxes. That's $6,810 for every man, woman and child in this country. 
   Mr. President, that is simply too much. Our high taxes place an undue burden on working families. They stifle entrepreneurial activity. They promise to put an end to our current era of sustained economic growth. 
   But hard times born of high taxes are not inevitable. We can lighten the tax burden on our working families. We can encourage entrepreneurial activity and economic growth. We can cut taxes and thereby ensure prosperity well into the next century. 
   Mr. President, when President Clinton passed the largest tax hike in American history, he did so on the grounds that budget deficits demanded increased federal revenue. There was indeed increased federal revenue after that tax hike. But it was fueled by a surprisingly strong economy, born of technological innovation and low inflation, factors strong enough to offset the dampening effects of higher taxes. Moreover, the excuse of budget deficits is no longer tenable. 
   We have entered an era of budget surplus. And it is our moral duty as well as our fiscal responsibility to lower taxes on those hard working Americans who pulled us out of the era of budget deficits. 
   What is more, by taking a small portion of our projected surplus and giving it back to the American people, we will ensure prosperity, economic growth, and healthy receipts for years to come. 
   Mr. President, this across the board tax cut will leave the current tax structure's progressivity intact. It also leaves current deductions and credits intact. It is not intended as a final solution to all of the problems in our tax system. This tax cut is intended as a well-deserved down payment on the money Washington owes to the American people--the money earned by the American people that should stay with the American people, to save, invest and spend as they see fit. 
   America's working families deserve a break. They also need it if they are to save and invest for their future and for the future of the American economy. It is time to give them that hard-earned tax break by cutting rates across the board by 10 percent. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation in the name of fairness and economic responsibility.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to seek my colleagues' support for the Wei Jingsheng Freedom of Conscience Act. This bill will grant lawful permanent residence to writer and philosopher Wei Jingsheng, one of the most heroic individuals the international human rights community has known. This bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent in 1998 but was not acted upon in the House before the end of last session. 
   Mr. President, when I first introduced this legislation I noted that, for years, Wei has stood up to an oppressive Chinese government, calling for freedom and democracy through speeches, writings, and as a prominent participant in the Democracy Wall movement. I also noted that his dedication to the principles we hold dear, and on which our nation was founded, brought him 15 years of torture and imprisonment at the hands of the Chinese communist regime. Seriously ill, Wei was released only after great international public outcry. Now essentially exiled, he lives in the United States on a temporary visa and cannot return to China without facing further imprisonment. 
   Now more than ever, Mr. President, I believe that granting Wei permanent residence will show that America stands by those who are willing to stand up for the principles we cherish. It also will help Wei in his continuing fight for freedom and democracy in China. 
   I would like to thank Senators FEINGOLD, ALLARD, and WELLSTONE for cosponsoring this bill. I should note also that this legislation has been endorsed by important human rights groups such as the Laogai Research Foundation and Human Rights in China, two organizations devoted, at great risk to their members and their members' families, to combating oppression in communist China. 
   I urge my colleagues to send a strong signal about America's commitment to human rights, human freedom, and the dignity of the individual by passing this bill to grant Wei Jingsheng lawful permanent residence in the United States.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Congressional Pension Disclosure Act of 1999 which would require the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives to disclose information relating to the pensions of Members of Congress. This legislation would require these officers to include in their semiannual reports to Congress detailed information relating to the Members pensions. The semiannual reports would then be available to the public for inspection. 
   The reports would include the individual pension contributions of Members; an estimate of annuities which they would receive based on the earliest possible date they would be eligible to receive annuity payments by reason of retirement; and any other information necessary to enable the public to accurately compute the Federal retirement benefits of each Member based on various assumptions of years of service and age of separation from service by reason of retirement. 
   The purpose of this legislation is to afford citizens their rightful opportunity to learn how public funds are being utilized. The taxpayers are not only entitled to know the various forms of compensation their elected officials are being paid, they are also entitled to make decisions about the reasonableness of such compensation. 
   My bill would make this information conveniently available to the public. I believe that this bill would eliminate the present shroud of secrecy which has surrounded the congressional pension system and give the public better access to information regarding their representatives in Congress. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the bill and section by section analysis be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Victim Restitution Enforcement Act of 1999. I have long supported restitution for crime victims, and have long been convinced that justice requires us to devise effective mechanisms through which victims can enforce restitution orders and make criminals pay for their crimes. 
   I was very pleased when we enacted mandatory victim restitution legislation in the 104th Congress as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. I supported that legislation and very much appreciated the efforts of my colleagues, particularly Senators HATCH, BIDEN, NICKLES, GRASSLEY, and MCCAIN, to ensure that victim restitution provisions were included in the antiterrorism legislation. 
   Those victim restitution provisions--brought together as the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996--will significantly advance the cause of justice for victims in federal criminal cases. The Act requires federal courts, when sentencing criminal defendants, to order these defendants to pay restitution to the victims of their crimes. It also establishes a single set of procedures for the issuance of restitution orders in federal criminal cases to provide uniformity in the federal system. Inclusion of mandatory victim restitution provisions in the federal criminal code was long overdue, and I am pleased that the 104th Congress was able to accomplish that. 
   However, much more remains to be done to ensure that victims can actually collect those restitution payments and to provide victims with effective means to pursue whatever restitution payments are owed to them. Even if a defendant may not have the resources to pay off a restitution order fully, victims should still be entitled to go after whatever resources a defendant does have and to collect whatever they can. We should not effectively tell victims that it is not worth going after whatever payments they might get. That is what could happen under the current system, in which victims have to rely on government attorneys--who may be busy with many other matters--to pursue restitution payments. Instead, we should give victims themselves the tools they need so that they can get what is rightfully theirs. 
   The victim restitution provisions enacted in the 104th Congress consolidated the procedures for the collection of unpaid restitution with existing procedures for the collection of unpaid  fines. Unless more steps are taken to make enforcement of restitution orders more effective for victims, we risk allowing mandatory restitution to be mandatory in name only, with criminals able to evade ever paying their restitution and victims left without the ability to take action to enforce restitution orders. 
   In the 104th Congress, I introduced the Victim Restitution Enforcement Act of 1995. Many components of my legislation were also included in the victim restitution legislation enacted as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. The legislation I introduce today is similar to the legislation I 
   introduced in the 104th Congress as Senate Bill S. 1504 and again in the 105th Congress as S. 812, and is designed to build on what are now current provisions of law. All in all, I hope to ensure that restitution payments from criminals to victims become a reality, and that victims have a greater degree of control in going after criminals to obtain restitution payments. 
   Under my legislation, restitution orders would be enforceable as a civil debt, payable immediately. Most restitution is now collected entirely through the criminal justice system. It is frequently paid as directed by the probation officer, which means restitution payments cannot begin until the prisoner is released. This bill makes restitution orders payable immediately, as a civil debt, speeding recovery and impeding attempts by criminals to avoid repayment. This provision will not impose criminal penalties on those unable to pay, but will simply allow civil collection against those who have assets. 
   This will provide victims with new means of collecting restitution payments. If the debt is payable immediately, all normal civil collection procedures, including the Federal Debt Collection Act, can be used to collect the debt. The bill explicitly gives victims access to other civil procedures already in place for the collection of debts. This lightens the burden of collecting debt on our Federal courts and prosecutors. 
   My bill further provides that Federal courts will continue to have jurisdiction over criminal restitution judgments for five years, not including time that the defendant is incarcerated. The court is presently permitted to resentence or take several other actions against a criminal who willfully refuses to make restitution payments; the court may do so until the termination of the term of parole. Courts should have the ability to do more over a longer period of time, and to select those means that are more likely to prove successful. Under my bill, during the extended period, Federal courts will be permitted, where the defendant knowingly fails to make restitution payments, to modify the terms or conditions of a defendant's parole, extend the defendant's probation or supervised release, hold the defendant in contempt, increase the defendant's original sentence, or revoke probation or supervised release. 
   My legislation will also give the courts power to impose pre-sentence restraints on defendants' uses of their assets in appropriate cases. This will prevent well-heeled defendants from dissipating assets prior to sentencing. Without such provisions, mandatory victim restitution provisions may well be useless in many cases. Even in those rare cases in which a defendant has the means to pay full restitution at once, if the court has no capacity to prevent the defendant from spending ill-gotten gains or other assets prior to the sentencing phase, there may be nothing left for the victim by the time the restitution order is entered. 
   The provisions permitting pre-sentence restraints are similar to other provisions that already exist in the law for private civil actions and asset forfeiture cases, and they provide adequate protections for defendants. They require a court hearing, for example, and place the burden on the government to show by a preponderance of the evidence that pre-sentence restraints are warranted. 
   In short, I want to make criminals pay and to give victims the tools with which to make them pay. In enacting mandatory victim restitution legislation in the 104th Congress, we demonstrated our willingness to make some crimes subject to this process. I believe we must take additional steps to make those mandatorily issued orders easily enforceable. 
   This legislation is supported by the National Victim Center and by the Michigan Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence. I ask unanimous consent to have placed in the RECORD letters of support from those victims' rights organizations. 
   I urge my colleagues to support my legislation, which will empower victims to collect on the debts that they are owed by criminals and which will improve the enforceability of restitution orders. 
   I also ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be placed in the RECORD.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce ``The Powder Cocaine Sentencing Act of 1999.'' This legislation would toughen federal policy toward powder cocaine dealers by reducing from 500 to 50 grams the amount of powder cocaine a person must be convicted of distributing in order to receive a mandatory 5 year minimum sentence. 
   I am convinced, Mr. President, that we need tougher sentences for powder cocaine dealers so that we may protect our kids from drugs and our neighborhoods from the violence and social breakdown that accompany drug trafficking. 
   We have seen a disturbing trend in recent years, a reversal, really, of the decade long progress we enjoyed in the war on drugs. For example, over the last six years the percentage of high school seniors admitting that they had used an illicit drug has risen by more than half. This spells trouble for our children. Increased drug use means increased danger of every social pathology of which we know. It must stop. 
   Ironically, at the same time that we are learning the disturbing news about overall drug use among teens, we also are finding heartening news in our war on violent crime. The F.B.I. now reports that, since 1991, the number of homicides committed in the United States has dropped by 31 percent. Also since 1991, the number of robberies has fallen 32 percent. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, robberies fell a stunning 17 percent in 1997 alone. 
   This is good news, Mr. President. And there is widespread agreement among experts in the field that the principal cause of this decline in violent crime is our success in curbing the crack cocaine epidemic and the violent gang activities that accompany that epidemic. The New York Times recently reported on a conference of criminologists held in New Orleans. Experts at the conference agreed that the rise and fall in violent crime during the 1980s and 1990s closely paralleled the rise and fall of the crack epidemic. 
   At the same time, there is a warning signal here. The most recent ``Monitoring the Future'' Study done by the University of Michigan, which tracks drug use and attitudes by teenagers, showed an increase in the use of both crack and powder cocaine this year. This is in contrast to its finding that the use of other drugs by kids may finally be leveling off, albeit at unacceptably high levels. 
   Yet surprisingly, despite these developments, in last year's Ten Year Plan for a National Drug Control Strategy, the Administration proposed making crack sentences 5 times more lenient than they are today. Why? The Administration say we need to reduce crack dealer sentences because they are too tough when compared to sentences for powder cocaine dealers. And it is true that it does not make sense for people higher on the drug chain to get lighter sentences than those at the bottom. But going easier on crack peddlers--the dealers who infest our school yards and playgrounds--is not the solution. Crack is cheap and highly addictive. Tough crack sentences have encouraged many dealers to turn in their superiors in exchange for leniency. Softening these sentences will remove that incentive and undermine our prosecutors, making them less effective at protecting our children and our neighborhoods. 
   The Powder Cocaine Sentencing Act rests on the conviction that there is a better way to bring crack and powder cocaine sentences more in line. First, it rejects any proposal to lower sentences for crack dealers. Second, it makes sentences for powder cocaine dealers a good deal tougher than they are today. 
   Mr. President, this legislation will reduce the differential between the amount of powder and crack cocaine required to trigger a mandatory minimum sentence from 100 to 1 to 10 to 1--the same ratio proposed by the Administration. But this legislation will accomplish that goal, not by making crack dealer sentences more lenient, but rather by toughening sentences for powder cocaine dealers. 
   At this crucial time we may be making real progress in winning the war on violent crime in part because we have sent the message that crack gang membership is no way to live and that society will come down very hard on those spreading this pernicious drug. At the same time our kids remain all too exposed to dangerous drugs, far more exposed than any of us can probably really imagine. In light of these two trends, it would be a catastrophic mistake to let any drug dealer think that the cost of doing business is going down. As important, Mr. President, it will be nearly impossible to succeed in discouraging our children from using drugs if they hear we are lowering sentences for any category of drug dealers. 
   I ask my colleagues to send a strong message to drug dealers and to our kids, the message that drugs are dangerous and illegal, and those who sell them will not be tolerated. This legislation will send this message, and I urge my colleagues to give it their full support.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with Senators LEVIN, ASHCROFT, and DEWINE that would freeze the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards--known as CAFE--at current levels unless changed by Congress. 
   This issue is attracting an increased amount of attention as automobile manufacturers continue to increase car and light truck efficiency and as Americans begin to understand the consequences of increased fuel economy standards: less consumer choice, more dangerous vehicles and reduced competitiveness for domestic automobile manufacturers. Perhaps, Mr. President, some of these repercussions could be easier to accept if the supposed benefits of increased CAFE standards were ever realized, but this has not occurred. In the two decades since CAFE standards were first mandated, this Nation's oil imports have grown to account for nearly half our annual consumption and the average number of miles driven by Americans has increased. 
   Mr. President, last session 15 Senators from both sides of the aisle joined me in sponsoring this legislation. Given the importance of the automobile industry to the continued economic health of the country, the preference for increased capacity that American consumers have demonstrated and the producers' continuing trend toward more efficient engines, it is time for the setting of CAFE standards to once again reside with elected officials.

   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1999.'' This legislation, which I am introducing today with my distinguished colleagues, Senator DASCHLE and Senator CHAFEE, is designed to protect over 90 endangered species of bird spending certain seasons in the United States and other seasons in other nations of the Western Hemisphere. This is actually the second time Senator DASCHLE and I have introduced this bill. Last year, after receiving considerable support from the environmental community, this legislation passed the Senate by unanimous consent. Unfortunately, time ran out for equal consideration in the House. Nevertheless, we are back again with renewed determination and I believe the effort in the 106th Congress will prove successful. 
   Every year, Mr. President, approximately 25 million Americans travel to observe birds, and 60 million American adults watch and feed birds at home. Bird-watching is a source of real pleasure to many Americans, as well as a source of important revenue to states,  like my own state of Michigan, which attract tourists to their scenes of natural beauty. Bird watching and feeding generates fully $20 billion every year in revenue across America. 
   Birdwatching is a popular activity in Michigan, and its increased popularity is reflected by an increase in tourist dollars being spent in small, rural communities. Healthy bird populations also prevent hundreds of millions of dollars in economic losses each year to farming and timber interests. They help control insect populations, thereby preventing crop failures and infestations. 
   Despite the enormous benefits we derive from our bird populations, many of them are struggling to survive. Ninety species are listed as endangered or threatened in the United States. Another 124 species are of high conservation concern. In my own state we are working to bring the Kirtland's Warbler back from the brink of extinction. In recent years, the population of this distinctive bird has been estimated at approximately 200 nesting pairs. That number has recently increased to an estimated 800 nesting pairs, but this entire species spends half of the year in the Bahamas. Therefore, the significant efforts made by Michigan's Department of Natural Resources and concerned residents will not be enough to save this bird if its winter habitat is degraded or destroyed. Not surprisingly, the primary reason for most declines is the loss of bird habitat. 
   This situation is not unique, among bird watchers' favorites, many neotropical birds are endangered or of high conservation concern. And several of the most popular neotropical species, including bluebirds, robins, goldfinches and orioles, migrate to and from the Caribbean and Latin America. 
   Because neotropical migratory birds range across a number of international borders every year, we must work to establish safeguards at both ends of their migration routes, as well as at critical stopover areas along their way. Only in this way can conservation efforts prove successful. 
   That is why Senator DASCHLE, Senator CHAFEE and I have introduced the ``Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act.'' This legislation will protect bird habitats across international boundaries by establishing partnerships between the 
   business community, nongovernmental organizations and foreign nations. By teaming businesses with international organizations concerned to protect the environment we can combine capital with know-how. By partnering these entities with local organizations in countries where bird habitat is endangered we can see to it that local people receive the training they need to preserve this habitat and maintain this critical natural resource. 
   This act establishes a three year demonstration project providing $8 million each year to help establish programs in the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean. The greater portion of these funds will be focused outside the U.S. Approved programs will manage and conserve neotropical migratory bird populations. Those eligible to participate will include national and international nongovernmental organizations and business interest, as well as U.S. government entities. 
   The key to this act is cooperation among nongovernmental organizations. The federal share of each project's cost is never to exceed 33 percent. For grants awarded outside the U.S., the nonfederal match can be made with in-kind contributions. This will encourage volunteerism and local interest in communities that lack the financial resource to contribute currency. Since domestic organizations and communities are more financially secure, the matching portion of grants awarded within the U.S. will be required in cash. 
   The approach taken by this legislation differs from that of current programs in that it is proactive and, by avoiding a crisis management approach, will prove significantly more cost effective. In addition, this legislation does not call for complicated and expensive bureaucratic structures such as councils, commissions or multi-tiered oversight structures. Further, this legislation will bring needed attention and expertise to areas now receiving relatively little attention in the area of environmental degradation. 
   This legislation has the support of the National Audubon Society, the American Bird Conservancy and the Ornithological Council. These organizations agree with Senator DASCHLE, SENATOR CHAFEE and I that, by establishing partnerships between business, government and nongovernmental organizations both here and abroad we can greatly enhance the protection of migratory bird habitat.

    Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to pay homage to Sergeant Dennis W. Finch of the Traverse City Police Department. Sergeant Finch was not only a great family man, police officer, and Michigander, he was a great American. The day of May thirteenth 1998 will forever be a day of mourning for the Traverse City community, a tragic day that will leave an indelible change on the fabric of life in Traverse City. Sergeant Finch lost his life in the line of duty, protecting a community that he loved. His dedication and pride is a testament to the extremely difficult and admirable role that police officers play in this country. Sergeant Finch protected us proudly with the shield of the Traverse City Police Department, and we will be forever thankful. 
   Sergeant Finch lived the life of hero, before becoming a Traverse City Police Officer, Dennis served proudly in the United States Marine Corps in Vietnam. Dennis distinguished himself as a soldier, and was a decorated combat veteran. In his thirty years of service to the Traverse City Police Department, Sergeant Finch was the Department's most seniored Sergeant. He was a command officer in both the Investigative Services Division and the Patrol Division for twenty-four years. 
   During this difficult time, my thoughts and prayers go out to Sergeant Finch's family, friends and all police officers who risk their lives every day in this country. Thank you and God bless.
