   Mr. MURKOWSKI. My colleague from Wisconsin is correct, and I am sure my colleague shares my concern that the Secretary of Agriculture has not met  the requirement of section 704 of ANILCA that he report to the President and Congress within three years his recommendation as to the suitability and nonsuitability of such lands for wilderness designation. I would also note that the submission of these applications by the CAC pre-dated enactment of ANILCA.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to honor a truly great Alaskan, a close personal friend, Elmer Rasmuson, who passed away last Saturday at the age of 91. Alaska is a far better place as a consequence of his life of public service, his achievements in business, and his personal philanthropy. 
   Elmer was born in Yakutat, Alaska in 1909, not long after the Klondike gold rush. His life spanned Alaska's modern history, history that he had a significant hand in shaping. 
   Elmer served Alaskans in both the public and private realms. He was a successful banker who put together Alaska's first system of statewide branch banking. That wasn't any easy thing to do in a wild, far-flung territory like Alaska with four time zones, but he succeeded in doing a tremendous job with tremendous imagination and perseverance. 
   Along the way, Elmer amassed a personal fortune, which he had, in recent years, used to benefit libraries, museums, and universities in our State. This legacy will live on, as it was Elmer's wish that his personal fortune continue to benefit Alaska long after his death. 
   Elmer also enjoyed a distinguished record of public service. He served on the University of Alaska Board of Regents for nearly twenty years; and he was the mayor of Anchorage from 1964-1967--including the difficult period of time encompassing the Good Friday Earthquake of 1964 and the rebuilding of Alaska's largest city. 
   Elmer also had a keen interest and expertise in fisheries issues. He served on the International North Pacific Fisheries Commission from 1969 to 1984; he served as the first Chairman of the North Pacific Fisheries Management Council. He was instrumental in the creation of the 200-mile fisheries limit, and in rebuilding the State's salmon runs after years of federal neglect. 
   Elmer brought this knowledge of fisheries management to the U.S. Arctic Research Commission, a position  that President Ronald Reagan appointed him to fill in 1988. He served in that position with great distinction, to the benefit of Alaska and the entire Nation. 
   We will long remember the benefits from his legacy of continuing philanthropy. Elmer hired me back in 1959, my first job in banking. I worked for him as a branch manager at one of the small offices in Anchorage and later throughout offices in southeastern Alaska. We remained close friends through the 40 years that followed. His son Ed and his wife Cathy have shared many memories and good times with both Nancy and me. 
   Elmer's commitment to Alaska was evident in many ways. In the private sector, he was willing to take risks, commit capital to budding enterprises in Alaska. In the public realm, he gave of his time and fortune. Just last year, Elmer and his wife Mary Louise donated $40 million to the Rasmuson Foundation so the foundation can provide grants to education and social service nonprofit organizations. He also gave another $50 million to the Anchorage Museum of History which Elmer helped start. In fact, on his 90th birthday he gave away $90 million. He also donated the largest single donation to the University of Alaska Museum in Fairbanks. 
   It is important to add that Elmer was generous in many other ways other than his wealth. He gave his time and effort to civic groups, including the Boy Scouts. 
   There is a saying that the true meaning of life is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit. That is the true test of generosity. By that measure, Elmer Rasmuson was an extraordinary individual in his generosity. Alaskans will remember him for generations to come. They, as Nancy and I, will miss him greatly.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, congratulations are in order for a ``Royal'' Alaskan on my staff. Staff Assistant Ivette Fernandez was recently crowned Miss Alaska USA 2001 at the state pageant held in Anchorage. Ivette was judged in the interview, swimsuit, and evening gown competitions. Along with the title of Miss Alaska USA, Ivette also was honored with the Miss Congeniality title. 
   Born and raised in Fairbanks, Alaska, Ivette is the daughter of Antonio and Gloria Fernandez of Fairbanks. She is a graduate of Lathrop High School in Fairbanks and attended the University of Alaska Fairbanks before transferring to The George Washington University (GWU) in Washington, DC. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from GWU in the fall of 1999. Her future plans include attending law school and working in International Affairs. 
   As the new Miss Alaska USA, Ivette will represent Alaska in the Miss USA pageant which will be held in early February in Gary, Indiana. Ivette will compete for the title of Miss USA with other young women from 49 states and the District of Columbia. 
   Upon winning the Miss Alaska USA title, Ivette won scholarship and wardrobe money, a free trip to the national pageant, and other generous prizes, as well as her crown and sash. However, this is not her first time wearing a crown. In April 1999, Ivette represented Alaska as our Cherry Blossom Princess for the National Cherry Blossom Festival here in Washington, DC. 
   My wife Nancy and I have known Ivette for many years. We are very proud of her and her accomplishments, and we know that she will represent Alaska with poise and distinction. Ivette is a pleasure to be around and a great asset to my office staff. 
   Mr. President, my staff and I want to wish Ivette the best of luck when she competes in the Miss USA pageant this coming February, and we again extend our congratulations to her on winning her title.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I note that the Energy Committee is contemplating a hearing on Tuesday on the spiraling price increases associated with natural gas. We are seeing a situation in existence now where we have terminated trading, for a portion of yesterday at least, in natural gas. I am told that natural gas was selling for about $2.16 per thousand cubic feet about 9 months ago. Last month it was $5.40; $7 last week. Yesterday it hit a high of $8.80. We really have a crisis developing in this country, not only from the standpoint of the adequacy of our natural gas supplies to meet our electric generation requirements but home heating as well, inasmuch as 50 percent of the homes in the United States are heated by gas. 
   I thank my colleague from Washington, Senator MURRAY, for the time she allotted me. I wish the Chair a good day and my good friend from Washington as well. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I listened with great attention to my friend, Senator DODD, who I think expresses the feelings that we all have for Senator MOYNIHAN. I first met Senator MOYNIHAN before I came to the Senate. He visited Alaska, my home. Nobody could suggest that he is anything but awe-inspiring, enthusiastic, and interested, the type who leaves one after a short meeting with the feeling that here indeed is an extraordinary individual, a true statesman, a visionary. And the type of individual who we have all had an opportunity to share and enjoy and love during his tenure here. 
   I extend my heartiest best wishes to Senator MOYNIHAN and his family as he departs this body, and it is with fondness for the contributions he has made. He has made this a much better body because of his contributions. I share the sentiments of my colleague from Connecticut.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me remind those of you who have followed the issue of energy in this country and the contribution of the nuclear industry of 20 percent of the electricity that is generated in this Nation, with an observation that I made some time ago, and that is this industry is strangling on its waste as a consequence of the inability of the Federal Government to honor the sanctity of a contract made some years ago--that the Government would take that waste beginning in 1998. The ratepayers, over the last decades, have extended about $11 billion to the Federal Government to ensure that the Federal Government would be financially able to take the waste. 
   The bottom line is that 1998 has come and gone, and the Federal Government is in violation of its contractual commitment. As a consequence, litigation is pending for this breach of contract, subjecting the taxpayers to somewhere between $40 billion and $60 billion in liability. 
   Now, I stated some time ago on this issue that if you throw the waste up in the air, it has to come down somewhere. Nobody wants it. I was wrong on that. It was thrown up in the air and now it is coming down. Where is it coming down? Well, it is coming down in California, in a place called San Onofre. That is near La Jolla, north of San Diego. It is on the California coast where there are decommissioned and operating nuclear plants.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this article explains that ``The California Coastal Commission will be approving the creation of a coastal nuclear waste dump just south of the Orange County border.'' 
   The repository will be at the San Onofre Nuclear Power Plant, and thousands of spent nuclear fuel rods would be stored there by Southern California Edison until the year 2050. That is 50 years, Mr. President. Isn't it interesting that the State of California, which has refused to site even a low-level nuclear waste storage facility in the Mojave Desert is now going to be home to a high-level nuclear waste dump near the beaches of southern California? 
   Referring briefly to the proposed Ward Valley waste facility, which would handle medical waste and other low-level waste--the Secretary of the Interior, Bruce Babbitt, stopped this site from becoming a reality. As a consequence, that waste is currently stored in hospitals and research facilities and universities--generally, anywhere near where the waste is created. A lot of it is medical waste and other low-level waste associated with diagnostic tests, cancer treatment and other types of medical and scientific research. But it is all over the place. It is in places that weren't designed to store that waste long-term. 
   However, national environmental groups and Hollywood activists made Ward Valley a rally cry, claiming water would be contaminated by the waste and seep through the desert and ultimately into the Colorado River. This is low-level material that we are talking about. It involves clothing, like gloves and coveralls from utility workers, material from medical research and any other items that have come into contact with radioactive materials. This low-level waste is produced at hospitals, powerplants, and research facilities that store this waste and periodically transfer it to waste facilities in South Carolina or Utah. 
   However, these same groups apparently are powerless to stop the San Onofre storage. Why? Because the responsibility to regulate high-level waste belongs to the Federal Government, not the State. And since the Federal Government has not done its job, the bottom line is that there is no Federal repository for high-level nuclear waste, as promised by the U.S. Government. It is an obligation that has been unfulfilled by the eight years of the Clinton-Gore administration,  who has chosen to ignore the contract, hoping they can get out of town and the election will be over before this issue comes up. 
   How ironic that this issue of the failure of the Federal Government to honor its contract should come up just a little less than a week before the election. As I have stated, that repository was supposed to open in 1998. Failure to do so left the States to come up with their own solutions and subjects the taxpayers to billions of dollars in liability. High-level waste includes spent fuel rods removed from nuclear reactors. This Senator from Alaska introduced S. 1287 in this Congress to allow the high-level nuclear waste to go to the proposed Yucca Mountain high-level storage facility in Nevada for temporary storage as soon as the facility was licensed in 2006. 
   The California delegation voted against that bill and the Clinton administration vetoed the bill. We are one vote short of a veto override. One of the arguments made was that there was a possibility that the nuclear waste could seep into the water table and move into California. Imagine that. Now I don't believe that is possible, nor do a great number of respected scientist. However, isn't it ironic that Californians will now have to cope with those fears in their own backyard because Yucca is still not opened? Rather than worry about waste in Nevada, they get to worry about waste in California. The site at San Onofre has operational nuclear plants as well as a shut down research reactor. Unfortunately, once shut down begins, they have no place to take the waste, so the waste stays there on the area adjacent to the 
   Pacific Ocean, an area not designed for long-term storage of waste. Nevertheless, there is no alternative because the Federal Government has failed to fulfill its obligation to take spent fuel beginning in 1998. 
   Let me make it clear, I don't believe there is any danger from the dry casks that will be stored at San Onofre, any more than there was a danger from the low-level waste that would have been effectively stored in the Mojave Desert that could not safely be stored at the Ward Valley site. This California solution--if it is a solution--simply confirms what we have been saying all along: No one wants this waste, but it has to go somewhere. It has finally come down and landed in San Onofre. If the waste isn't ultimately shipped to the temporary facility at Yucca Mountain, it is going to be stored at 80 sites throughout the United States. California now may have its own central repository, at least for Southern California Edison. 
   Mr. President, this solution is not a solution. And what people need to realize is this situation is really just the tip of the iceberg. While it is applicable to California today, there are over 80 sites throughout this country that will become de facto Yucca Mountains. That is the consequence of not opening up a permanent storage site. And many other states are in the same situation as California--waste to store and no place to store it. To give you some idea, in Florida, 16 percent of the electricity comes from nuclear plants, 5 nuclear power reactors, and almost 2,000 metric tons of waste is in storage. In Michigan, 24 percent of the electricity comes from 4 nuclear power reactors, 
   with 1,500 metric tons of waste on hand there. 
   In Ohio, 11 percent of electricity is generated from nuclear energy by two nuclear plants with 520 tons of waste. 
   In Washington State, 6 percent of the electricity comes from nuclear, and there is about 300 tons of research reactor fuel. 
   In Pennsylvania, 38 percent of its power comes from nine nuclear reactors with 3,000 metric tons of waste. 
   This situation in California just proves what I have been saying all along. If we don't take responsible action now to solve our high-level waste problems by siting a repository in the Nevada desert, we will end up with somewhere in the area of 80 to 100 sites throughout the Nation storing this waste in environments that are not approved environments for long-term storage. What is happening in California today will happen all over the nation. They will now have, in California, their very own mini-Yucca Mountain for the next 50 years. 
   The voters in California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Florida, and Illinois need to understand who bears the responsibility for this lack, if you will, of a conscientious effort to take the waste at the time it was contracted for in 1998. 
   I can only assume that Vice President GORE wants to keep this waste in the States near schools, and hospitals--wherever it is temporarily stored. And the reality of what happened in California today at San Onofre is simply the tip of the iceberg. 
   This administration has been totally inept in meeting its responsibilities to the nuclear industry; It has breached a contract, it has ignored the contribution of the nuclear industry and its contribution to providing 20 percent of the clean, emissions-free power generated in this country; and, totally ignored the reality that with that clean power comes the responsibility of determining how to handle the waste. 
   They have handled it all right. They set it in concrete in California in the new site, as I have indicated, at San Onofre, north of San Diego near La Jolla, CA. 
   Imagine creating a coastal nuclear waste just south of Orange County.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, 4 years ago, a theme in the election was, ``It's the economy, stupid.'' Well, that is true in this election, but there is something a little different: ``It's the energy crisis, stupid.'' 
   The Vice President would have us think the economy is the issue that will get him elected President, that he and President Clinton came up with a plan to tax gasoline and Social Security benefits, and once he cast the tie-breaking vote to increase your taxes and my taxes, interest rates came down, the stock market went up, and the economy prospered. 
   The Vice President and the Democrats conveniently ignore the fact that the economy had already begun posting strong growth before Clinton-Gore took office. That may sound like old hat, but the President's budget plans never once mentioned a balanced budget as a policy goal at that time. Instead, those budget plans predicted annual deficits of $200 billion a year well into the future. 
   As my colleagues and good friends Senator DOMENICI, Senator GRAMM, and others pointed out last night, the credit for our booming economy ought to be given to a couple of people. Specifically, one is Dr. Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve, for a sound fiscal policy that prevented the onset of inflation. As we know, Greenspan has been around a long time. 
   Further, a Republican Congress deserves some credit for putting controls on Federal spending and turning the deficit into a surplus. 
   I will not spend a lot of time today on that subject because I rise to talk about energy. I want to talk about the reality that the administration has no energy policy. The energy policy in this country, for what it is worth, is dictated by America's environmental community. They accept no responsibility for the reality that we are short of energy and becoming more and more dependent on foreign sources of oil. 
   As we look at our economic prosperity over the past few years, there is a growing concern that it might be coming to an end, partially for lack of a sound national energy policy. Look at the American consumers out there. They are finding themselves under the shadow, if you will, of a failed energy policy. We have crude oil prices which are remaining solidly at $30 plus a barrel but, remember, it was March of 1999 when it was $10 a barrel. 
   The administration blames ``Big Oil.'' They use the word ``profiteering.'' Well, is the implication then, in March of 1999, that ``Big Oil'' was giving us a gift of some kind, selling it to us at $10 a barrel or was it supply and demand? Who sets the price of oil? Is it Exxon? Is it British Petroleum? Is it Phillips? It certainly is not. We all know that. 
   It is from where we import the oil. It is Saudi Arabia. It is Venezuela. It is Mexico. They are setting the price of oil. Why? Because we are approximately 58 percent dependent on imported oil. We are addicted to oil. We don't produce enough, so we pay the going price. If we don't pay it, somebody else will. 
   Why has it gone up? The general economy of the world has gone up; Japan has recovered; Asia, more demand. We are a society that runs on energy. All our communications, our expansion, our e-mail, computers, all are dependent on energy. 
   So American consumers are finding themselves in the shadow of a failed energy policy, with crude oil prices at $30 plus a barrel--they have been up as high as $37 a barrel--and gasoline prices averaging well above $1.50 a gallon for most of the year. In some areas, they have gone up to nearly $2 a gallon. 
   The sleeper here is natural gas. Americans haven't awakened yet to the reality that natural gas prices have more than doubled. Ten months ago, they were at $2.16 per thousand cubic feet of gas. Deliveries in November of this year, just beginning tomorrow, were at one time in the area of $5.30 to $5.40. I would remind my colleagues that 50 percent of the homes in this country heat on natural gas. 
   U.S. consumers have dealt with electricity price spikes and supply disruptions. All you have to do is go to San Diego, California; you will get a flavor for what is happening. You can't get a permit to put in a new generating plant. Consumers are facing brownouts as a consequence and prices are going up. People are closing their businesses. They cannot pay, in many cases, the rates that are being charged in that particular area of California. 
   Heating oil inventories--which we are concerned about, particularly in  the Northeast, where there is such dependence on heating oil--are at the lowest level in decades. In fact, when the President proposed the sale of SPR--30 million barrels from the SPR reserve in Louisiana--and then initiated an action to order the transfer of that crude oil into refineries, we suddenly found that we had another problem--we didn't have refining capacity; they were operating at about 96-percent capacity. We took this additional oil out of SPR and we found out we could not refine it without displacing other imported oil. 
   This was testimony in the House and Senate. In the hearing I chaired as Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, testimony indicated there would be, out of the 30 million barrels, about 3 to 5 million barrels of distillate. We asked the Under Secretary of Energy: How much heating oil are you going to get out of 3 to 5 million barrels of distillate? Frankly, he didn't know. 
   There was another hearing going on in the House, and witnesses from the same Department of Energy indicated there would be approximately 250,000 barrels. A 1-day supply of heating oil in the Northeast is about a million barrels. So it is somewhere between a half day's supply and 2 to 3 days' supply. This was all a result of the falderal associated with the release of the SPR. 
   The objective of the SPR release was to increase the heating oil supply in the Northeast Corridor. Did it occur? It clearly did not. Was there manipulation of price? To some extent. It was $37 and it dropped down to $33, or thereabouts, on that announcement. But it clearly didn't increase the supply of heating oil, and that was the objective. Currently, I am told the price of crude oil is $33.75 a barrel, but let's remember from where we started--$37 per barrel. 
   The nice thing about what the OPEC nations have done is they have gradually assimilated a price increase so it doesn't hurt so bad. Remember, it was $10 a year ago. Then it got up to $17, $18, $19, and then up to $22. At $22, OPEC advised us they were going to put in a floor and a ceiling. The ceiling was $28; the floor was $22. That worked so well they moved it up beyond $28. Now they are in the low thirties. Well, the sky is the limit. 
   The point is that the administration has no energy policy. Now, how long has it been going on? We point fingers here, and it is easy to do, particularly in a political season. But we really don't have a strategy. We need a strategy because the cost of increasing energy, the shortage of energy, and the increased dependence on imports is a compromise of our national security. 
   Moving from national security back to the economy, economists now believe the increased energy prices could very well lead to a slowdown in consumer spending. Consumers are likely to cut back in other areas to offset the higher prices they are paying for gasoline, electricity, home heating oil, or natural gas. 
   Recently, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated rising energy costs would push up the cost of consumer goods. Why? Delivery costs are associated with movement of these goods to market. We are seeing that as a reality. Wholesale prices, in September, increased nine-tenths of 1 percent, led mainly by a 3.7-percent increase in energy costs. Where I come from that is called inflation. You don't need an economic degree to see it; the math is simple. Higher natural gas prices, plus higher oil prices, plus higher gasoline and fuel oil prices, plus higher electric prices, equals renewed increasing inflation. We haven't poked that tiger 
   in the ribs for a long time, but we are poking him now and he is waiting. Somebody called him a ``sleeping dragon'' who has been sitting around for the better part of a decade. As we poke him in the ribs with higher energy prices, we are going to face reality, which is an impact on the economy both here and in countries around the world. 
   A significant number of Fortune 500 companies have reported third quarter earnings under expectations, largely due to the increased energy costs. Have you taken an airplane ride lately? You can't figure out the fares, whether you fly Saturday before 2 o'clock or Thursday after 5 o'clock; but there is a surcharge included in your fare. If you want a Washington, DC, taxi, there is a surcharge. There is a sticker in the cab that says the fares are up 50 cents or so because of the cost of gas. Every business is facing these costs. Fuel costs put the brakes on truckers' profits. Furniture manufacturers have cut earnings projections. We have seen truckers come into Washington and drive trucks across the lawn, and they were talking about the high price of diesel fuel. They say high gas prices are restraining shoppers from buying furniture and other big-ticket items. 
   Well, many analysts predict high oil prices could reduce U.S. economic growth by as much as 2 percent this year. What does that mean? Over the next five years, that would mean a loss in the GDP of about $165 billion a year, and about 5.5 million fewer jobs. We face an increasing balance of payments from our ever-increasing reliance on foreign oil. That is a balance of payments deficit. 
   Our trade deficit hit an all-time record in July of this year, pushed by the cost of imported oil. One-third of our trade deficit is the cost of imported oil. We also face the prospect of, frankly, an unreliable electric supply, weakening the backbone of the new economy. 
   Most people don't realize that high tech means high electric usage, more computers, more e-mail, more taxes. From where will it come? Add these together and you have the makings of an economic slowdown, meltdown--call it what you like. The economic engine, which is responsible for the incredible prosperity of the past decade, can begin to slow down and is beginning to slow down. Nobody really wants to face up to that because times have been good, but everything changes and nothing stands still. 
   What has been the response of the administration? Well, the administration, of course, wants to take credit for the economic growth of the past few years, but they try to duck the responsibility for the impending energy crisis that threatens to bring this period of prosperity to an end. The administration has consistently restricted our energy supply and forced higher energy prices on consumers. They have specifically opposed domestic oil exploration and production. We have 17 percent less domestic oil production--less production--since President Clinton and Vice President Gore took office. 
   We have had 136,000 oil and 57,000 gas wells close in this country since 1992. We have tremendous coal reserves in this country, but the administration is opposed to the use of that coal. We haven't built a new coal fired plant since the mid-1990s. EPA permits make it absolutely uneconomic. You can't get permits. The nuclear industry, which is about 20 percent of the power generated in this country, is choking on its own waste. 
   We are one vote short in this body of overriding a Presidential veto. Every Member who voted against it should remember that. You have a responsibility. If you don't get your electric power from nuclear, from where are you going to get it? You better have an answer because when constituents have a brownout, they are going to ask why. 
   There is a court of appeals liability case associated with the nuclear industry where the court said that the Federal Government made a contractual commitment to take the waste in 1998. The Federal Government chose to ignore that liability to the taxpayers of somewhere in the area of $40 billion to $80 billion. Nobody bats an eye here. What is the sanctity of a contract? I know it means something to the occupant of the chair and to me. The court said the Government should keep its word, but the Government simply ignores it. 
   Somebody else is going to have to take care of it on another watch. 
   They also threaten to tear down hydroelectric dams out West. There is a tradeoff. Tear down those dams, and we don't have navigation on those rivers. Where do we put the barge traffic? We put the traffic back on the highways. What is the implication of that? You can move an awful lot of material on barges. If you move that same material on highways, you are going to create traffic problems, pollution problems, and so forth. 
   We ignored electric reliability and supply concerns with the brownouts in San Diego. We have had no new generation of transmission facilities, yet the consumer market has grown. The Vice  President has said he will even go further to restrict new oil and gas exploration and production. In Rye, NH, on October 21, 1999, Vice President Gore made the following statement:  
   I will make sure that there is no new oil leasing off the coast of California and Florida and then I will go much further. I will do everything in my power to make sure that there is no new drilling off these sensitive areas, even in areas already leased by previous administrations.  
   That doesn't sound very good, when most of our oil is coming from the Gulf of Mexico. 
   On energy, there is a clear distinction between the two sides. The difference between Vice President Gore and Governor Bush could not be more clear. The Bush proposal is $7.1 billion over 10 years; the Gore proposal is 10 times that amount, some $80 to $125 billion. The Vice President has said he has an energy plan that focuses not only on increasing the supply but also working on the consumption side. 
   The facts show the Vice President doesn't necessarily practice what he preaches. The Vice President wants to raise prices and limit supply of fossil energy which makes up over 80 percent of our energy needs. By discouraging domestic production, the Clinton-Gore administration has forced us to be more dependent on foreign oil, placing our Nation's security at risk. All we have to do is witness the growing influence of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, and the Middle East as a result of our increasing dependence on foreign oil. How can we be an honest broker in the Middle East peace process when we are beholden to Israel's sworn enemy, Saddam Hussein, to keep our citizens warm this winter? 
   We currently import 600,000 barrels a day from Iraq. The Vice President's only answer is to give solar, wind, and biomass energy technologies that are not widely available or affordable. We have expended $6 billion in a combination of grants and subsidies for alternative energy. I am all for these alternative energies, but they still consist of less than 4 percent of our energy. It is incomprehensible to me that we would fail to recognize that we have to rely on our conventional sources--oil, natural gas, hydroelectric, and nuclear. The Vice President seems to have forgotten these basic sources of energy. As a matter of fact, we need a mix of all of the above. 
   In contrast, Governor Bush would put together a comprehensive energy policy for America that uses the fuels of today to get the technologies of tomorrow. The energy policy would contain three major components: First, increased domestic production of oil and natural gas to meet today's consumer demands for energy; second, increased use of alternative fuels and renewable energy to help us transition into the technologies of tomorrow; third, improve energy efficiency to save American consumers money and reduce emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases. Governor Bush would encourage new domestic oil and gas exploration right here at home. He has said: The only way to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore here at home. 
   Just opening the ANWR Coastal Plain in my State increases domestic production capability by better than a million barrels a day, more than twice the amount we currently import from Iraq.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Let me read a portion:  
   Another surprise was a solid support (54 percent to 38 percent) for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. ANWR's coastal plain could hold as much oil as Alaska's highly productive Prudhoe Bay.  
   I think that is a significant indication of the public posture and the change. As we have noted for some time, Vice President Gore is very much opposed to opening this area. This body, in 1995, passed legislative action authorizing the opening of ANWR, but the President vetoed that action. We have today a clear indication of support from a majority of Americans who now favor responsible drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
   For the sake of keeping this matter in balance, I remind my colleagues there are 19 million acres in that area. Out of that 19 million acres, which is about the size of the State of South Carolina, 9 million acres has been set aside in a refuge, 8.5 million acres has been set aside in a wilderness. This is in perpetuity. Congress left out 1.5 million to be determined at a future date whether it should be open for exploration. Geologists say it is the most likely area in North America where a major oil field might be discovered, and there might be as much as 16 billion barrels in that field. That would equate to what we import from Saudi Arabia for a 30-year period of time. Some of the environmentalists say it is only a 200-day supply. Isn't that in error? That is assuming all other oil production in the world stops. 
   Prudhoe Bay came on about 23 years ago. It has been producing about 20 percent of the total crude oil produced in this Nation for that period of time. They said it was only going to produce 10 billion barrels. It has produced 12 billion barrels so far and still produces a million barrels a day. 
   The prospects of finding oil domestically, in the volumes we are talking about, in this small sliver of the Coastal Plain are very good. As a consequence, it is rather comforting to note that a distinguished periodical such as the Christian Science Monitor should conduct an independent poll and find that 54 percent of Americans solidly support opening up ANWR for drilling; 38 percent are opposed. 
   One other point that deserves consideration has been underplayed by the media and underplayed by the administration. That is the situation with regard to natural gas. Governor Bush's energy plan is more than just increasing the domestic supply of oil. He would also expand access to natural gas on Federal lands and build more gas pipeline. Even the Vice President has said natural gas is vital for home heating and electricity and fuel for the future. Mr. President, 50 percent of U.S. homes, or 56 million homes, use natural gas for heating. It provides 15 percent of the Nation's electric power; and 95 percent of our new electric power plants will be powered by natural gas as a fuel, partially of choice but partially of necessity. 
   You cannot build a coal-fired plant; you cannot build a nuclear plant; you cannot build a new hydroelectric plant. Where are you going to go? You are going to go to natural gas. You can get a permit. But all the emphasis of the electric industry is towards natural gas. Putting on more pressure increases the prices, as I said, from $2.16 a year ago to just over $4.50 today. The ratepayers are going to be paying this. They just have not seen it yet. It has not been included in your electric bills, but it will be very soon, and you will feel it in your heating bill. 
   The administration has refused to allow exploration or production of natural gas on Federal lands. There are huge areas of the overthrust belt in Oklahoma, Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado that have been off limits. The administration has withdrawn about 60 percent of the productive area for oil and gas discoveries since 1992. 
   The difficulty we are having here is, as they put Federal lands off limits to new natural gas production, we find ourselves with simply no place to go other than the offshore areas of Texas and Louisiana and the offshore areas of Mississippi and Alabama as the major areas of OCS activity. My State of Alaska and California are off limits; the East Coast is off limits. They have withdrawn huge areas from our Forest Service--roadless areas. They have put on a moratorium from OCS drilling until 2012 in many areas. The Vice President would even cancel existing oil and gas leases. Where is the energy going to come from? 
   The Vice President said during his first debate:  
   We have to bet on the future and move away from the current technologies to have a whole new generation of more efficient, cleaner energy technologies.  
   I buy that, and so does the American public. But he forgets to be specific: Where? How? Why? How much? Where are you going to get the energy? 
   I think we all agree in this case our energy strategy should include improved energy efficiency as well as expanded use of alternative fuels and renewable energy. But we are still going to need energy from oil, natural gas, hydroelectric and nuclear, and we are not bringing these other sources into the mix. 
   The Vice President said he would make a bet. He will bet on diminishing the supply of conventional fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas. That is his bet, that you would like that; that you would be more than willing to pay higher prices for energy and make renewables more competitive. You would like that. He will support higher energy taxes, just as he did in 1993 when he cast the tie-breaking vote in this body to raise the gasoline tax. 
   This is in his book ``Earth In The Balance.'' Clearly, he wants to raise energy prices to effect conservation. But the reality is, as we put more central controls on energy use, he would have us set a standard for each part of your everyday life. He would tell you what kind of energy you could use, how much of it you could use, how much you would have to pay for it. That is part of it. That is in his book. 
   By contrast, Governor Bush would harness America's innovation to use the energy resources of today to give us the technologies of tomorrow. Governor Bush will set aside the up-front funds from leasing Federal lands for oil and gas, so-called bid bonuses, to be earmarked for basic research into renewable energy. Production royalties for oil and gas leases will be invested in energy conservation and low-income family programs such as LIHEAP and other weatherization assistance. 
   Using new tax incentives, Governor Bush will expand the use of renewable energy in the marketplace, building on a successful experience in the State of Texas. As a result of Governor Bush's efforts on electricity restructuring, Texas will be one of the largest markets for renewable energy, some 2,000 new megawatts. 
   Governor Bush will maintain existing hydroelectric dams and 
   streamline the FERC relicensing program. We know the current administration wants to take down some of the dams in the Pacific Northwest. Governor Bush will responsibly address the risks posed by global climate change through investing in getting clean energy technologies to the market. 
   The Vice President would rather have us ratify and implement a costly and flawed Kyoto Protocol that puts the United States at an economic disadvantage.  
   Some of us remember the vote we had here with respect to climate change and the Kyoto Protocol--the Byrd/Hagel Resolution. I think it was 95-0. The administration asked for our opinion. We are a body of advice and consent. We gave our advice. I think that vote pretty much indicates a lack of consent. That particular proposal exempts the largest emitters of greenhouse gases, China and India. 
   In conclusion, the bottom line is there is a clear contrast between the candidates on the subject of energy policy. The Vice President wants to raise prices to limit supply of fossil energy which makes up currently over 80 percent of our energy needs. We wish it were less, but that is the reality. He wants to replace it with solar, wind, biomass--technologies that are promising but they are simply not available or affordable at this time. 
   Governor Bush will expand domestic production of oil and natural gas, ensuring affordable and secure supplies, reducing energy costs, and keeping inflation at bay. Governor Bush will use the energy of today to yield cleaner, more affordable energy sources of tomorrow. 
   The choice for consumers is very clear. 
   Let me leave you with one thought with regard to our foreign policy. Currently we are importing about 600,000 barrels a day from Iraq. I know the occupant of the chair recalls in 1991 and 1992 when we fought a war, the Persian Gulf war, we had 147 American service personnel who gave their lives in that war, with 427 wounded; we had 23 taken prisoner. How quickly we forget. 
   Now we are over there enforcing, if you will, an aerial blockade, a no-fly zone. We have flown over 300,000 sorties, individual missions, enforcing the no-fly zone over Iraq. We have bombed; we have fired; we have intercepted. Fortunately, we have not suffered a loss. But what kind of foreign policy is it where we buy his oil, put it in our airplanes, and go over and bomb him? I leave you with that thought, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I have a question about a last minute change in language of the appropriations measure establishing a Coastal Impact Assistance program as section 31 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The Coastal Impact Assistance program, with relatively few changes, is identical to language referred to and reported by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources as part of H.R. 701, the Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 2000, commonly referred to as CARA. The last minute change I am concerned about places the Secretary of Commerce in charge of the Coastal Impact Assistance program rather than the Secretary of the Interior. Both the House of Representatives, when it passed CARA, and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, when it reported CARA to the Senate, placed responsibility for Coastal Impact Assistance with the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary of the Interior has the overall responsibility under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act for the leasing program that creates the impact on our coastal communities that Coastal Impact assistance seeks to address and is also the source of revenues to fund not only such assistance but also various conservation programs that were included under CARA. I do not understand why the change was made, but I want to make certain that the change has no effect on the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources over the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and especially exclusive jurisdiction over the Coastal Impact Assistance program established under section 31 of that act.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Yes, Mr. President, I agree. This legislation does not overturn the State of Mississippi's reservation of its mineral rights. The deed asserts ownership, and this legislation does nothing to discredit such deed. 
   I thank Senator COCHRAN and Senator LOTT for their sponsorship of this legislation that will preserve Cat Island and add the last piece of the Mississippi Sound Barrier Islands to the Gulf Islands National Seashore. It is an important addition and one that will be treasured for years to come.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is late. We have had pretty candid discussions on various issues before us. It is a political season. There is a lot of finger pointing, whether we talk about Social Security, Medicare, or the benefits of care associated with drug plans. I think we all share a common commitment to try to have meaningful legislation come out of the process. We simply have different points of view. 
   You heard the Senator from Florida comment extensively on the Republican plan to strengthen Medicare. I am not here to comment on the Republican plan on Medicare, although I think it is quite defensible. But I am here to talk about the Democratic plan for an energy policy.  
   You will notice, unlike the Senator from Florida, that I don't have a chart to show you what the Democratic energy plan is for the simple reason that there isn't any. This administration has absolutely no energy plan as evidenced by the dilemma that we face in this country as we watch our imports from the Mideast climb to approximately 58 percent. Fifty-eight percent of the oil that we consume in this country is imported. 
   We have seen a dramatic increase in the price of gasoline. Gasoline is in the area of $1.75 cents to $1.80, depending on the grade. 
   We have seen heating oil in the country raised to approximately $1.56. Here in Washington alone, it has increased 56 cents a gallon in less than 10 months. 
   We have seen natural gas on which 50 percent of the homes in this country are dependent increase from $2.16 for 1,000 cubic feet to deliveries in November at $5.40 per 1,000 cubic feet. 
   We have a situation with our refining industry in which we haven't built a new refinery in this country in decades. We have shut down 30-some refineries. We find ourselves at loggerheads because of our inability to refine, if you will, enough of the blends to address the Northeast heating oil shortage. 
   It is fair to say that we don't have a defined energy policy. We have an energy policy that seems to be driven by environmental groups that do not accept the responsibility for realism. 
   Realism dictates that we are not going to move out of here tomorrow or the next day on hot air. 
   We are going to move out on kerosene. Kerosene comes from oil. Kerosene is what you put in the jet airplane. I don't attempt to be oversimplistic, but what we continue to need in this country is a balance of all the energy resources. 
   The Middle East last week gave us another reminder as to our crisis. That is the fear that we are going to be held hostage to foreign oil imports. I have been coming to this floor for many days now warning of how our dependence on foreign oil threatens the national security of this Nation. I certainly don't take any pride at this late hour in coming here and saying I told you so. We know the Middle East is a tinderbox. Some of our most impassioned enemies are already lighting fires there. 
   What little energy policy this administration has in the sense of increasing reliance on foreign oil has come in conflict, in my opinion, with our foreign policy. How can we pretend to play the role of an ally to Israel or even an honest broker when we are now beholden to Israel's sworn enemy, Saddam Hussein, of Iraq? 
   Now we are looking to Saddam Hussein to keep our citizens from freezing this winter. We are importing about 750,000 barrels of oil a day from Saddam Hussein. Many people forget we fought a war over there in 1991 and 1992. We lost 147 American lives. 
   Today, the real wild card is in Iraq and the Middle East. I mentioned my previous concern over Saddam Hussein and the leverage he brings, but some analysts estimate that oil will increase to $40 to $45 a barrel if Iraq halts oil sales or reduces oil sales. The significance of that is the position that Saddam Hussein and Iraq currently hold. 
   Iraq, we know, has threatened to stop oil exports if the U.N. doesn't convert Iraqi dollars held by the U.N. to Euro dollars for trading. We know Iraqi exports have dropped a little bit, by about 500,000 barrels a day just last week. It is not clear whether this is the start of an ominous trend. Even if supply disruptions do not occur, world oil markets are stretched so thin that even the possibility of a disruption could raise prices even more. And it did so last week. 
   Currently, I think oil closed today around $34 a barrel. We have seen a high on two occasions of $37 within the last month or so. But the reality is that Saddam Hussein controls about almost 2.8 million barrels a day of daily exports, and that is more than the available excess capacity worldwide. 
   What I am saying is that the difference between the world's ability to produce oil and the world's consumption is a little over a million barrels--there is a little over a million-barrel capacity--but Saddam Hussein controls 2.8 million. My point is if Saddam Hussein reduces his sales, then we are in an even tighter position and as a consequence we can expect the price to go up. And Saddam Hussein is aware of this. 
   There is no question about his actions of late. He has become more aggressive in recent months. It is rather interesting to note, after every speech, he concludes it with ``Death to Israel.'' If there is ever a threat to Israel's security, it comes from Iraq. He has a $14,000 bounty on each American plane shot down. Thank God there haven't been any. But we have flown over 200,000 individual flights over Iraq, enforcing the no-fly zone, an area of blockade since the 1990s. 
   Last month, Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of stealing Iraqi oil. Here we go again. He did this shortly before invading Kuwait in 1990. 
   Last week, nearly 15,000 Iraqi Republican Guard troops moved westward in a show of force, obviously toward Israel. Just yesterday, Saddam Hussein said: Jihad, holy war, is the only way to liberate Palestine. 
   How quickly we forget. Let me remind everyone, before President Clinton and Vice President GORE took office, we carried out Desert Storm and 147 Americans were killed, 467 were wounded, and 23 were taken prisoner. We continue to enforce the no-fly zone. The cost to the taxpayers is about $50 million per month. It is still going on. Yet the administration seems to want to rely more on Iraqi oil. 
   We have had in this country a 17-percent decline in domestic production, yet the demand has increased 14 percent. In August of last year, we consumed more oil in this country than ever before. What is the rationale? 
   We are traveling more. The economy is growing. We are an electronic society. We need more energy. Where does it come from? It doesn't come from thin air. Now 58 percent of our oil comes from overseas. Some people perhaps remember 1973 when we had the Arab oil embargo. We had lines around the block. People were indignant. They were mad. They were outraged. We couldn't get gasoline at the gas station. At that time, we were 36-percent dependent on imported oil and we created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
   Here we are today with Iraq, the fastest growing source of U.S. foreign oil, 750,000 barrels a day, nearly 50 percent of all Iraqi exports. I don't want to be oversimplistic, but we buy Saddam Hussein's oil, put it in our airplanes, and go over and bomb him. Is that a sensible, responsible foreign policy? 
   In a few words, that is what is happening. You can interpret it however you desire. This administration's inattention to maintaining the U.N. conditions against Iraq has left the sanctions in a shambles. We aren't doing any weapons inspections in Iraq; increased Iraqi flights across Saudi airspace in the no-fly zone continue; his development of missile, missile delivery systems, and biological warfare capabilities continues. Russia and France have openly challenged our sanctions. Turkey sends flights to Baghdad despite the U.N. ban. 
   It is simply not working. Our friends in Jordan are demanding the end to inspections of Iraqi imports through Jordanian ports. Saddam Hussein is about to get a free pass to import anything he wishes despite the U.N. sanctions. Does anyone doubt he will be able to import what he needs to continue his weapons of mass destruction? We are going to have to deal with this one of these days. 
   Let me say again what little energy policy we seem to have is a reliance on imported oil, and it has certainly come into conflict with our foreign policy, with potentially disastrous consequences for American consumers and our national security. 
   I am pleased to say that George W. Bush, and our Vice President nominee, Mr. Cheney, have spoken about how to decrease our dependence on imported oil by developing some of the reserves that we have here at home, open up the overthrust belt--Wyoming, Colorado, Utah--areas where we have great potential, areas where the administration has closed up to 64 percent of the public land, exempting that area from development, and my State of Alaska, where the administration refuses to allow an opening of the area which might have the largest reserves known to exist in North America, that small sliver of ANWR. 
   There are a lot of misunderstandings about the area of Alaska known as  ANWR. It is 19 million acres, the size of the State of South Carolina. Congress, wisely, has taken out of that 19 million acres, 8.5 million acres and put it in permanent wilderness. They have taken another 9 million acres and put it into a refuge, leaving 1.5 million acres for a decision to be made whether to open it. The geologists tell us there might be as much as 16 billion barrels of oil there. That would equal what we import from Saudi Arabia for a 30-year period. It is a very significant amount. 
   Some people say that is a 200-day supply. That is totally unrealistic because that assumes there would be no other oil produced anywhere in the world. Obviously the Russians, the Venezuelans, and the others would produce. 
   So as we look at potential energy sources here at home, I think we have to look to the advanced technology that we have been able to develop in this country and the record of opening up areas in the Arctic such as Prudhoe Bay, where we find a contribution of nearly 20 percent of the total crude oil produced in this country. That has come about over a period of 23 years. The significance of that speaks for itself. 
   You might not like oil fields, but Prudhoe Bay is the best in the world. We could have the same potential by opening up that small sliver of the Arctic known as the 1002 area. 
   The interesting thing is that industry tells us, out of 1.5 million acres, we would probably utilize as little as 2,000 acres--not much bigger than a medium-sized farm--to open up the area. 
   I was rather interested in looking at the Christian Science Monitor the other day. They did a poll across America on what the attitude would be of opening ANWR. The poll was 58 to 34 in favor. That is a rather startling result, and I think it surprised some of the folks at the newspaper as well. 
   The point is, charity does begin at home. There are those on the other side who simply blame big oil. I remind them, where was big oil when they were handing out oil a year ago at $10 a barrel? Big oil in this country--Exxon, British Petroleum, Chevron, Texaco--does not set the price of oil. Do you know why? Because we are so dependent on imports. Saudi Arabia, OPEC, Mexico, Venezuela--they are the suppliers. They are supplying us with 58 percent. They set the price. We are addicted; we pay it; and that is the consequence of becoming so dependent when, indeed, we have the technology in this country to open up some of these frontiers safely. 
   We have, in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, an unused capacity of a million barrels a day. As a consequence, the development of that portion of ANWR could be done very easily, and it could be done very quickly. If we had the conviction of our 
   commitments to simply make a statement that that is our intention, there is no question in the mind of this Senator we would see oil drop $10 a barrel. We saw the President's action the other day when he pulled 30 million barrels out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The price dropped from $37 a barrel to somewhere in the area of $32 a barrel. 
   Let me conclude with a little evaluation of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the actions, or should I say the ``mis-actions'' of the administration handling them. 
   As we know, when the Vice President made a recommendation to the President that we sell 30 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the price was nearly $37 a barrel, prices which last month prompted the administration, of course, to release this oil from SPR. Now word comes from the Department of Energy that initially only 7 million barrels of that original 30 million barrels would have to go up for rebid. It is kind of interesting because they waived the normal bid requirements. They didn't require normal financial responsibility. They said they would do that later. Three of the bidders could not meet the demands, and as a consequence they had to bid it again. But they recognized their mistake the next time because they did require the bidders meet financial capability for performance. 
   In any event, according to the Department of Energy's own analysis, 20 million of the 30 million barrels will simply displace foreign oil imports. The reason for that is our refineries are running at 96-percent capacity. They cannot, basically, take any more oil. They can only get so much out through this process because we have not built new refineries in 10 years. We have simply increased some of our larger refineries. We have also lost about 37 refineries in the last decade. It is not a very attractive business to be in. 
   In any event, the Department of Energy has decided that out of the 30 million barrels, there are probably going to be only 10 million barrels that are going to be refined into finished product. Currently, U.S. refinery yields are about 8 percent heating oil and 92 percent other products, whether it be gasoline, diesel, kerosene, and so forth. So if we do the math, while the Department of Energy suggests 3 million to 5 million barrels of heating oil will result from the SPR release, we find that the testimony from those representing the Department of Energy uses the terminology ``distillates.'' 
   What are distillates? They would lead you to believe this was heating oil and would benefit the Northeast, but it is not. We found out that current refinery yields of 10 million barrels of SPR oil will yield only 800,000 barrels of heating oil. That is less than a 1-day supply. 
   When you look at the intent of the administration's effort to open up the SPR, it was to increase the heating oil supply availability in the Northeast, a portion of the country that does not have the availability of natural gas. Their objective was not achieved. They have less than a 1-day supply out of this sale. How ironic. 
   What they did is they did manipulate the price because the price did drop, but the supply did not increase. If the administration's intent was to get more heating oil to the market, that certainly was not the way to do it. They could have explored thoroughly the offer by the Venezuelan state oil company to produce heating oil for direct delivery to the United States or they could have made a greater effort to convince 
   companies to voluntarily reduce exports, refine product until stocks were at a more comfortable level. 
   Again, I refer you to the objective. The objective was not met. Manipulation of the price was. But I do not think this was the real reason for the SPR release. As I have indicated, the real reason was to manipulate the price. They had some success. Prices did dip down to $31 a barrel. But we have seen that erased, with prices back up to $34 a barrel. 
   Heating oil stocks in the Northeast have actually declined. They have declined 600,000 barrels since the administration came up with the idea of releasing the SPR crude oil, which has to be refined and, incidentally, is not going to be made available until November. 
   One of the more interesting things they left out of the sale was no prohibition against exporting the SPR oil, so many of the profiteers in oil simply bid the oil in with the idea of exporting it. There was no ban on exports and there was no ban on heating oil. The market in Europe is higher than the U.S. Some traders will simply refine that crude oil, turn it into heating oil, and export it to Europe because they had no prohibition in their bid. 
   The administration's logic was flawed when it announced this, and it seems to have only gotten worse. The bottom line is, rather than increase domestic production of oil and gas to ensure our energy security, again the administration falls back to its reliance on foreign oil imports, posing significant threat to our national security, undermining our foreign policy in the Mideast, and the administration's strategy is also to try to manipulate prices when necessary by releasing oil from SPR. 
   We need a real energy policy, such as that proposed by one of the candidates for President, Governor Bush; one that ensures a clean, affordable, secure energy supply for American consumers, 
   one that increases domestic production of oil and gas. Why should we be exploring in the rain forests of Colombia where there are no environmental considerations? Instead, we should be using our technology to develop the frontier areas in the overthrust belt in my State of Alaska. We need to expand the use of alternative fuels and renewable energy, which is part of the Bush-Cheney plan, and we need improved energy efficiency for all kinds of energy uses. I am pleased to say that is a position Governor Bush supports as well.  
   The emphasis of this administration has been on natural gas. The only problem is there has been a tremendous increase in the price of natural gas. Natural gas was $2.16, as I said, 10 months ago. It is $5.40 per delivery per thousand cubic feet. The emphasis, particularly from our utility industry, is that they have nowhere to turn for a source of energy other than natural gas. There has not been a new coal-fired plant built in this country since the mid-1990s. We have no new hydrodams. In fact, the administration is supporting taking out hydrodams in the West. There has been a collapse of our nuclear program. We cannot address the nuclear waste issue. We have not built a new reactor in 15 to 20 years and none are on the horizon. 
   As a consequence, we need to go back to our energy policy and bring a balance. Bring in nuclear. Obviously, it contributes to the quality of our air. Look at hydro, which we can safely develop. Look at clean coal. We have the technology to do it. We can recognize that 50 percent of the homes dependent on natural gas are going to be subject to some substantial price increases if we do not develop more energy at home. As a consequence, what we need here is a balanced energy policy. The administration's energy policy is that there simply is not any.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, with the President contemplating a visit to North Korea, I think it is fair to question the logic of that kind of a decision at this time. This historic meeting, if it does take place between the two leaders, could have significant implications for North and South Korea. I will explain a little bit more. 
   The leader of North Korea has hinted at plans to cease missile testing. He has indicated a proposed halt to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and North Korea's hermit-like isolation. I have had the opportunity to visit North Korea. I was one of the first Members of this body about 5 years ago to fly in an Air Force plane to North Korea, the first Air Force plane to fly there since 1943. It was an extraordinary lesson in a country that is probably as backward as any nation on Earth. 
   In any event, it is fair to say our Secretary of State, in completing a series of historic meetings with the North Korean leaders in Pyongyang, has set the stage pretty much for a Presidential visit. 
   The concern I have associated with the development of a rapport between North and South Korea, I wonder just what the benefit of a U.S. intervention could be at this time. Still, while improving relations certainly is a cause for optimism, I do not think it is really time to celebrate. 
   North Korea has a horrendous record. For over 50 years, it has been a living embodiment, if you will, of George Orwell's nightmarish visions. The original Big Brother, Kim Il-Song, has been replaced by his son. A legacy of terror and aggression pervades in that country. Recent efforts to recast North Korea's leader Kim Chong-il as a likable fellow strikes me as little out of character. Here is a man whose regime has for years been at the top of America's terrorist watch list. There is no question he assassinated South Korean officials in Burma several years ago. They fired missiles across Japanese territory not long ago and actively sought to develop nuclear capability. It has been a regime whose policy has resulted in mass starvation of its people, that diverts food and resources of the neediest to feed and house the few who live in splendor, and develop, obviously, their weapons capability. 
   This is a man who utters an offhand remark suggesting that North Korea could be convinced to halt its missile program, and the administration seems to hail him as showing ``a willingness to undertake reform.'' I guess I am not quite ready to buy that yet. I think that is a naive approach. I am a little more skeptical. 
   At every turn, North Korea's concessions have turned out to be false promises made strictly to blackmail U.S. and South Korea into giving direct economic assistance to the bankrupt North. 
   I wonder why we are so eager to believe that North Korea's apparent concessions now are anything other than a pretext. 
   Like my colleagues, I certainly applaud South Korea's President Kim Dae-jung's sunshine diplomacy efforts to reduce North-South tensions. His efforts have been admirable. I think the Koreans should be taking the lead themselves in rebuilding the trust between the two nations. Only through that direct effort by the two sides, free of outside interference, can tensions truly be resolved. 
   As a consequence, I worry that the administration's 
   bull-in-the-China-shop-like interjection of itself into the dialog threatens to dictate, perhaps overwhelm, the delicate process of trust building. 
   Already we have seen North Korea delay fulfillment of its commitments to South Korea because it ``was too busy'' preparing for Secretary Albright's visit. This suggests to me that the North might shift attention to relations with the U.S. and away from South Korea and have the effect of undermining attempts at a true accord between North and South. 
   I understand President Clinton is anxious for a foreign policy accomplishment in light of the difficulties in the Mideast. He certainly worked toward resolution. It is unfortunate that has not happened. In any event, the question of peaceful and secure relations with North Korea would be a valuable legacy, but I question the direct involvement in the process and whether or not that shifting away from the South Korean dialog with the North to the intervention of the U.S. may be harmful at this time. 
   Not only would efforts to reach a speedy agreement with North Korea be premature, in my opinion, it would seem to reward the North for 50 years of aggression as thanks for 6 months of sunshine. 
   Both the prospects for peace and the President's legacy would be best served if he were to stay, I believe, on the sidelines and allow the U.S.-North Korean relations to proceed as they have been, with caution and balance. I urge the President to put diplomacy ahead of legacy and not spend the final days of his administration interposing the U.S. between the two Koreas.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the purpose of my reference is that I happen to be chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee which historically has had jurisdiction over Outer Continental Shelf activities. I was one of the major drafters of this legislation, along with Representative DON YOUNG in the House of Representatives. 
   In moving this legislation through yesterday morning, we found a significant change had been made in the legislation and that the jurisdiction had been moved from the Energy Committee to Commerce and taken from Interior and transferred over to the Secretary of Commerce. 
   I know this cannot be seen, but there are handwritten notations at the end that simply say: ``11(a) the term 'Secretary' means Secretary of Commerce.'' 
   There are extraordinary things done in late times around here. This was done at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning the day before yesterday, and no one can identify who did it. But the bill was filed, the order has been made, and there is absolutely nothing we can do other than question the authenticity of someone who would simply change the legislation, not initial it, have no identification. I have checked with the Appropriations Committee. I have checked with the Members of the House involved. Nobody owns up to changing the designation of the CARA bill from the Energy Committee in the Department of Interior over to the Commerce Committee and the Secretary of Commerce. 
   The bill has been filed. As a consequence, the question is, What can we do about it? The President may veto the legislation. We may have another opportunity. 
   On the other hand, we did have a colloquy by Senator LOTT, Senator DASCHLE, Senator BYRD, Senator STEVENS, and myself. I think it addresses the reality that the best thing we can do is get out of here. I know the Presiding Officer would agree. But as we look at what we are coming back to tomorrow, a single vote on a continuing resolution for 1 day--and another one on Sunday--it seems to be an effort in futility. 
   But in any event, Mr. President, I thank you for being patient, and particularly the staff, as well, who probably had hoped this Senator would not show up when he walked in the door.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President. I rise today to congratulate my colleague from Colorado, Senator BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL, on the passage of S. 2508, the Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 2000. This important Indian water rights settlement would never have gotten as far as it has in the Senate without the hard work and dilligence of Senator CAMPBELL. As chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, I know how difficult it is to reach consensus on Indian water rights settlements. It takes a great deal of knowledge, dedication and downright hard work to get these kinds of bills through committee and onto the Senate floor and while the work can be frustrating, the rewards of a job well done are the appreciation of the Tribe and the water users. Senator CAMPBELL should reap those rewards. This settlement has been a long time coming and I hope the House of Representatives will look favorably on the hard work that has been done here and  pass this bill expeditiously so that it will make it to the White House and be signed into law. 
   My only regret is that this bill has taken so long to pass the Senate. Fulfilling this commitment to the Colorado Ute Indian Tribes and the Colorado water users never should have taken this long. The settlement agreement was signed in 1986 and now--finally--after 15 years of foot dragging and outright obstruction by outside groups, a bill to implement the agreement passes the Senate. The history of this unfulfilled promise is not a good one. For the past 15 years, numerous, and duplicative studies have been required, each of which resulted in substantial reductions in water to be diverted and stored in the Animas-La Plata project. The tribes, in order to get a project, have agreed to substantial modification of their rights under the 1986 agreement and 1988 Settlement Act to make this proposal work. The cost of the project has been cut by almost two thirds, yet opponents of the project are still unhappy. I wonder what would make them happy--complete and total derogation of the Federal Government's obligation to the tribes? I know Senator CAMPBELL would not let that happen and I would certainly support him in his efforts. 
   This bill, as passed today, represents the best hope for the United States to do right by the Colorado Ute Indian Tribes at this point and I am pleased to vote for it. I again congratulate Senator CAMPBELL.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in our desire to close the so-called 527 loophole involving campaign financing earlier this year, I believe we may have gone too far in the disclosure requirements. 
   In the bill ultimately creating P.L. 106-230, we essentially adopted the House language without any amendments. When it became law on July 1, 2000, one of the provisions required candidates for state and local offices to file Form 8871 by July 31, 2000. 
   The goal of the new law is to find out who is contributing to 527 political organizations that have proliferated in recent years. The organizations. including the Sierra Club's 527, were taking in large size donations and yet not have and to reveal who the donors were. 
   Under the new law, contributions in excess of $200 by a single person must be disclosed. Expenditures by a 527 organization in excess of $500 also would have to be disclosed. However, these financial disclosures--the heart and soul of the bill--do not apply to candidates for state and local elections. Clearly, the rules for state and local elections are to be regulated by the states, not the federal government. 
   Yet, under the new law, candidates for state and local offices must file Form 8871 with the IRS. This form essentially notifies IRS that state or local officeholder has established a 527  organization. It must also list the name and address of the organization, the purpose of the organization; the names and addresses of its officers and highly compensated persons and identify a contact person and custodian of records and its Board of Directors (if any). 
   Since we have exempted state and local candidates from having to file financial disclosure statements, I see no reason why they should be burdened with filing Form 8857. This requirement serves no purpose except to create needless paperwork for both the candidates and the IRS. 
   That is why I am introducing legislation to exempt state and local candidates from this burden just as the current law exempts 527 Organizations that do not expect that they will raise $25,000 do not have to file this information. 
   My bill is retroactive so that some candidates for local office who were caught unaware of the filing requirement do not face any penalties. 
   It is my hope that after this election, when campaign finance reform will be debated in a less political environment, that this common sense technical amendment will be included in reform legislation.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I share the concern expressed by my good friend from the State of Idaho with regard to the issue of global warming. Much of the rhetoric that has been used is not based on sound science. The reality that we have the technology, if given an opportunity to apply that technology, particularly in the developing Third World nations, results in a meaningful decrease of the concentrations of pollutants that we are all concerned about in association with clean air. 
   I commend my friend from Idaho for bringing this matter, again, to the attention of this body with the recognition that, indeed, through science and technology, we can make a significant difference in reducing overall the emissions, particularly from the emerging nations.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, my purpose in coming before the Senate at this late hour is to bring to your attention a rather catastrophic situation that is occurring in the world today. 
   We are all familiar with the devastation associated with the breakdown of the peace process in the Mideast and the tensions associated with the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. I think it is important to recognize another significant factor that has occurred today; that is, the price of oil has increased about $3.40 a barrel in one day. Currently oil closed at roughly $36.40. That is just a few cents under the all-time high of 3 1/2 weeks ago where oil closed at $37 a barrel. 
   Clearly, our increased dependence on Mideast oil, where we import about 58 percent of the total oil we consume, is a significant factor in recognizing that any conflict in the Mideast not only affects oil prices in the United States, because our supply is threatened, but it affects our stock market which has dropped rather dramatically today as well. 
   Let me highlight a few things that I think represent an inconsistency in the administration's policies towards developing a sound energy policy. 
   Perhaps you noticed, I am not wearing a dark shirt, a dark tie, the kind worn by Regis on ``Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?'' As you know, this is a TV show on ABC where contestants compete to win up to $1 million in prizes. It is my understanding that to win, contestants on the TV show must answer some questions, just as the administration has had to answer a series of questions regarding the lack of an energy policy. 
   If contestants on the TV show get stumped by a question, they can use a so-called lifeline. For example, they can phone a friend. Well, we have seen when oil prices rose, this administration phoned their friends. They phoned the Saudis and asked them for more crude oil, and the Saudis obliged. 
   Now, contestants can ask the audience--in other words, consult the polls--to see who has the right answers. Doesn't that sound familiar? The administration, of course, loves polls. 
   Finally, TV contestants can use a 50/50 where only two choices are presented, one of which is the right answer, helps them out a little bit, 
   not unlike the two contrasting energy policies that were presented by the major Presidential candidates. Well, the administration has used about all of its lifelines and still doesn't have an answer with regard to the energy policy. Now we find we are playing the game ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire'' with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at the expense of our national energy security. 
   Some of the lucky winners, speculators who bid on this crude oil released from SPR recently, stand to profit handsomely; there is no question about it. But we should reflect on what the purpose was. The purpose was to build up heating oil inventories in the Northeast. Well, it is pretty hard to make a case that anything realistic has been done as a consequence of the SPR sale to build up those reserves. 
   I recall that the Vice President called on the President a few weeks ago to authorize the release of 30 million barrels of oil from the SPR. That was on September 21. Interestingly enough, the President responded the very next day. It is important to grasp that the aim of the emergency release, according to the administration, was to increase heating oil stocks in the Northeast and prevent high heating oil prices this winter. But what has been the result, Mr. President? Heating oil stocks in the Northeast have actually declined. They have declined 600,000 barrels since the President made his announcement. Those figures, which we reviewed, came from the American Petroleum Institute. That is a very disturbing trend because we are entering the winter season. It is getting colder up there and the reserves, again, are 600,000 barrels less than when the President made his announcement on September 21. 
   One can question the motive. Was the motive to lower prices and provide an excuse, cover, throughout the winter heating season, and perhaps throughout the elections, to ensure that the administration was doing something about the energy problem, something about the price of oil, something about our dependence on the Mideast, something about meeting the obligation of having adequate heating oil reserves? 
   I think the administration's premise was flawed from the start. If you consider these realistic facts, at the time of the SPR release, our refineries were operating at between 95 and 96 percent of capacity. That is a fact. Now, the oil in SPR is crude oil. In order to refine it, it has to go to a refinery. Furthermore, our pipelines for crude and finished product are already operating to capacity. We haven't had a new refinery for nearly two decades. And 37 refineries have been closed in this country in the last 10 years. So what we have is a situation where we have a bottleneck at our refineries, regardless of how much crude oil we have. 
   New heating oil resulting from SPR releases can't be delivered until late November at the earliest because you have to take this oil out of the SPR in the salt caverns of Louisiana on the gulf coast and you can only recover about 4 million barrels a day maximum, and you have to move it through a pipeline, put it on a tanker, and transport it to a refinery that is already full. There would be no guarantee that the crude oil released from SPR would have to be turned into heating oil for use in the United States. In other words, when they made this sale, they didn't make any requirement that  whoever was the successful bidder on the sale was prohibited from exporting it. As a matter of fact, they didn't even have to turn it into heating oil. There is no provision in the 
   contractual terms that mandates if you are the successful bidder for the SPR oil, you have to either turn it into heating oil and put it in a reserve in the United States, or, for that matter, you can export the oil. You certainly don't have to refine the oil. 
   The Wall Street Journal reported last week that heating oil from the United States is now being exported to Europe. We checked on that and found out that that is true. The heating oil market there is 50 percent larger than the U.S. market. Stocks are tight and prices are a few cents a gallon higher. I mentioned this to some of the principals in the Department of Energy and they said: We are letting the free market work. 
   I said: It is certainly working because that is where it is going--to the highest return, which is Europe. 
   So refiners are able to ship heating oil over to Europe because they pay a premium price at a time when there is a real shortage here in the United States. 
   Another question is, Why didn't the administration, when it put up 30 million barrels, put in a prohibition on exporting that oil, a mandate that it had to be refined, a mandate that it had to go into a reserve? We took oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which was designed to address our needs should there be a curtailment of supply from the Mideast, and here we have a situation where no provision was even given to ensure that the action of taking 30 million barrels out of SPR resulted in any increase in our domestic heating oil supply for the Northeast part of the country. 
   And now the Department of Energy's Information Administration says that nearly two-thirds of the oil released from SPR--or 20 million barrels--will simply displace foreign imported oil. What that means is that we don't have the capacity in our refineries to take 30 million barrels; we are going to take 10. So instead of 30 million barrels, we will only get 10 million barrels of new crude actually from the SPR because of the displacement that I just explained. 
   Now, the Department of Energy claims that these 10 million barrels can still yield 3 million to 4 million barrels of heating oil. On the other hand, the industry tells us--and they are in the business because they have to refine it--that roughly 800,000 to 900,000 barrels of heating oil is all we are going to get out of the 10 million barrels that are refined. I don't know who is correct, but I suspect the industry is. In any event, recognize that the United States uses roughly 1 million barrels of heating oil a day. 
   So this pulldown of the SPR has either resulted in a 3-day supply or a 1-day supply. It sent a signal that we are so desperate that we are willing to reduce our Strategic Petroleum Reserve for the specific purpose of increasing the supply of heating oil, which we haven't achieved. One can question whether there was another motivation. Could that motivation have been to manipulate prices because prices did fall from $37 to about $32 after the announcement was made by the President that we were going to go in and sell 30 million barrels of SPR. But I point out where the price is today; the price closed at roughly $36.40 today. We are right back where we started. 
   As a consequence, the SPR release will, as I have said, likely end up representing less than 1 day's supply of heating oil. It is clear to me that the release of oil from the SPR won't help at all in increasing heating oil supplies in the Northeast this winter. If this had been the real concern of the administration, why would they turn away the invitation offered by Venezuela's state oil company, PDV, to produce heating oil for direct delivery to the United States? Well, we have asked the Secretary this. We asked him in an extended letter.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. This administration seems to have limited success in the real goal and, as I have indicated, it appears to be manipulating prices in the world market for, one can only conclude, a political effect. Crude oil prices, as I said, were at a 10-year high, $37 a barrel. After SPR, they hit $32. But today, as I have indicated, they are back up to $36.40. Along the way, they might be making some millionaires out of the speculators who were lucky enough to win a bid on SPR oil. We asked the Secretary to explain how those went out, who got them, how were they offered because if it is true, how did the administration, with this kind of an opportunity for speculators who didn't have to put up any financial requirement, prove a capability to get their bid? 
   It appears that anyone was eligible to play. 
   Let's look at some of the bidders. Without being specific, very little was required of anyone who wanted to bid on the SPR oil. They did not have to show any financial capacity. The excuse was they were going to take care of that later. That was the official response from the Department of Energy. You didn't have to have any previous experience in the energy market; no track record. You didn't have to have any agreements with refiners who refine the oil. You didn't have any guarantee of even access to refiners and no guarantee that heating oil would be reserved specifically for the Northeast. 
   They made this bid proposal without any requirement that you could not export it, without any requirement that it be held in the United States for the Northeast reserve. 
   As a consequence, what have we really accomplished? All the winning bidders needed to do was promise to return more oil to SPR than the other bidders. You might have a pretty inexperienced bidder who wanted to get the bid and who didn't have to put up any financial responsibility proof, bid high, and get an award. Once you get an award, you can turn around and market it. For the larger companies that have the financial capacity, it is perhaps a little different. 
   I don't begrudge anyone for making a return on an investment. But it is a rather peculiar and I would suggest a poor way for government to do business. 
   As I think back at government sales, for example, in the forests, the Forest Service requires a participant who is putting up a bid to also show financial responsibility. You have to put up a letter of guarantee in your bank to even bid. 
   What happened here is we had the letters go out from the Department of Energy to prospective bidders. They simply bid and got an award. Then they have to put up the financial responsibility under a letter of credit after the fact. 
   In the meantime, if they are a broker, as a few of these folks were, with no experience and no refinery capacity, they are simply going to bid on the oil, and hopefully the price of oil will increase. They can sell their position to somebody else and walk away with a couple of million dollars. 
   I guess that is part of what makes America great. But, by the same token, you wonder to whom that profit should belong. Should it belong to the taxpayer or the speculator who puts up nothing for the opportunity to get a position and then be fortunate enough to sell it so he can make a few bucks? 
   We will have to see either today or tomorrow, when the letters of credit are due, whether some of these speculators have the financial capacity to actually meet the conditions after the fact. But I can tell you this. I have checked with several of the companies. These speculators have been busy trying to resell their positions. We will see how many are able to make good on their promises. 
   But it is important to recognize the winners. What do they get? I don't want you to misunderstand. But they basically get to borrow the crude from SPR. And, if the price goes up, they can sell it at a higher price. They can take the money and buy back cheaper oil in 10 to 12 months to replace what they have borrowed from SPR with interest and, of course, keep any profits as a result. There is potentially millions of dollars--at whose expense? The taxpayer. 
   I have a little bit of background in banking and business. I can tell you it is a poor way to do business, to put out a bid 
   proposal without any financial requirement for performance. That is what the Department of Energy has done. I think it is totally inappropriate when other Government agencies such as the Forest Service have a proven list of bidders. 
   I want to make another observation.  
   Isn't it rather peculiar that we have a Strategic Petroleum Reserve with about a 56-day supply of oil in case this country finds its oil supplies in the Mideast, on which we are 58-percent dependent, cut off by some action and we don't have an approved list of bidders who have already proven their financial capacity or the wherewithal to refine the oil and get it to market so we can do this in a process of a very short time? If the supply is disrupted, we are going to need to move it in a short period of time. It doesn't appear to be the case. 
   The Department of Energy evidently doesn't have a standing list of bidders who are willing to take the oil at a price, refine it, and get it out to the market. It appears that what we have done here is put this out to the highest bidder, and some of these speculators say: I didn't have to put up anything. I have nothing to lose. If I get a position, I can turn around and try to sell my position hoping that the price of oil has gone up, as it has today $3.50, and make a few bucks without any risk individually--because they haven't had to put up anything. 
   Let's get this straight. I think this was done at a considerable risk to our national security, and as a consequence, the release of oil from SPR by this administration has not contributed one identifiable barrel to the heating oil reserve for the Northeast part of this country. 
   Remember what we have achieved so far in the sale is identification that perhaps we will get at least a day's worth of heating oil. But it is not going to arrive until sometime in November. 
   Further, most of the crude oil released from SPR appears to be going into the foreign markets because they are paying a higher price in Europe than we are paying in the United States. There is no prohibition against the export. The only folks who appear to benefit will be perhaps a few of the speculators and a few of the oil companies that hit the jackpot. I can't imagine the Vice President is going to generate any expanded support from it. But the losers are really the fuel-starved consumers in the Northeast, the people this was designed to help. 
   I think that raises a number of questions regarding the administration's ability to basically manage the SPR. 
   When I think of the situation, as I have seen it evolve, I think the Secretary and the administration owe us a few answers. 
   For example, who bid on crude oil from SPR and what did they offer? 
   Why were the winning bids selected? 
   Who didn't get selected and why? 
   Whom were the bids sent out to? 
   What assurances did the administration get that oil release from SPR would be turned into heating oil in the Northeast? 
   How did the winning bidders plan to refine SPR oil? 
   How will they get it to market? 
   Why didn't the Department of Energy have a preapproved list of bidders that might be required in a real supply emergency? 
   Why wasn't financial responsibility part of the bidding process, similar to the way the Forest Service puts up timber for bid with financial requirements to be part of the bid submission? 
   I have asked these questions of the Secretary. I look forward to his response. 
   With regard to our national energy security, I think this administration really needs to respond to this question. The question is: Is that your final answer? Because that is simply not good enough for the American people. 
   In conclusion, it is my intention, as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, to hold a hearing, which I intend to call for next Thursday, on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, to try to generate the factual information relative to just what has been accomplished and what assurances people of the Northeast have that this action will actually result in any increase in our reserves of heating oil for the coming winter in view of the circumstances that exist today--the conflict in the Mideast, the tensions, and the realization that, indeed, we are at a time when we have become so dependent on imported oil that our national energy security is dictated by the likes of Saddam Hussein, Iraq, and others who do not necessarily look for the best interests of the United States when they sell their product to us. 
   I am always reflective on Saddam Hussein and the realization that now we are importing about 750,000 barrels a day from Iraq. How quickly the American people forget that we lost 147 lives in 1992 in the Persian Gulf war; we had 437 wounded. The cost to the taxpayer was in the billions of dollars. 
   Now we are looking to Saddam Hussein as a savior for our addiction to oil. I think it is further interesting to note the action taken by Saddam Hussein in relationship to the demand on Iraq from the U.N. to begin to pay Kuwait for reparations from the conflict there in the invasion from Iraq into Kuwait. Saddam Hussein told the U.N., if you require payment now, I will reduce my oil production. It is my understanding that the U.N. said: We will talk about it next quarter. 
   If you look at where we are today, we find the world's production and the world's consumption are almost equal. There is a little bit more production than there is consumption--just about 1 million barrels a day. But Saddam Hussein is producing 2.9 million barrels a day. His threat to cut production could increase the price of oil from $36 today to $56 tomorrow. 
   I always recall the issue of Israel and our commitment to Israel's security. He ends virtually every speech with ``Death to Israel.'' If there ever is a threat to peace in the Middle East, it comes from Iraq. They are building up their missile-delivery capability, their biological capability, and as a consequence of what we are seeing today in the Middle East, the crisis is increasing by the hour, and as a consequence the threat is increasing. 
   So this is all coupled with dependence, an increased growing dependence on imported oil and the inability of the administration to face up to appropriate relief associated with reducing our dependence on imported oil by producing more oil at home in the overthrust belt in Wyoming, Colorado, Utah--areas where the Federal Government is now taking nearly 60 percent of the public land and putting it off limits. 
   In my State of Alaska, we are attempting to open up the small sliver of ANWR, roughly a footprint of 2,000 acres out of 19 million acres, a potential supply of 16 billion barrels that would replace what we import from Saudi Arabia over a 30-year period. These are the actions that could be taken as well as conservation and tax incentives to address our energy security. 
   If we were to take these actions, there is no question in my mind we would be sending a strong signal to the Middle East. We would see a very significant drop in oil, much more so than occurred the other day when the President announced the sale of 30 million barrels from the SPR. I suggest we could expect at least a $10 to $15 a barrel drop in the price of oil. 
   I was thinking about the remarks of the previous speaker relative to the political season we are in. I was reminded in the debate last night of a statement by the Vice President that he always opposed energy taxes. I guess perhaps the Vice President overlooked the fact that when the administration came in in 1993 the first tax they proposed was the Btu tax, British thermal unit, a tax on energy. It was defeated in this body. 
   However, shortly thereafter there was the effort by the Vice President, who was sitting in the chair of the Presiding Officer, and there was a tie vote in the Senate. The issue was the gas tax, 4.5 cents a gallon. The Vice President broke that tie and that gas tax went into effect. 
   In conclusion, I assume that the Vice President overlooked his record on increasing energy taxes and perhaps he should revisit his record and his memory.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I have been asked to announce today that the Senate will resume consideration of H.J. Res. 110, the continuing resolution. Under the order, the time until 10 a.m. will be equally divided with a vote scheduled to occur at 10 a.m. Following the vote, the Senate is expected to resume debate on the conference report to accompany H.R. 4578, the Interior appropriations bill. Cloture was filed on the conference report and it is hoped an agreement can be reached to have the cloture vote during today's session. The Senate may also begin consideration of any other conference reports available for action. I thank my colleagues for their attention. 
   Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Vermont would like to make a very special introduction. It will be my intention then to speak, and take the time of Senator STEVENS, leaving him about 5 minutes remaining on our side.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think it is important to note the situation escalating in the Mideast as a consequence of the tensions. It is unfortunate it would be at a time when we had hoped there would be an effort to get a firm peace agreement. As a consequence of that, I think it is important to bring to the attention of my colleagues a reality relative to the release of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at the recommendation of Vice President GORE to our President. 
   As you know, the President did release 30 million barrels of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This was the largest single release of crude oil from SPR in the 25-year history of the reserve. The administration has claimed this has been a successful effort because the price of oil has dropped. Notwithstanding that, using SPR to manipulate prices is contrary to the law because we have not reauthorized SPR, and of course the success of this is determined in the long term, not the short term. 
   But I wish to bring to the attention of each and every Member some facts. Since the President made his announcement, there has been no new heating oil placed into the market and no measurable rise in inventories. It may surprise some of you, particularly those in the Northeast, to know that American consumers may, under the current arrangement, never see any of the product refined from the crude oil that we released from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Let me explain why because this is important. 
   In the arrangement, there was absolutely no requirement that those who successfully bid on crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve needed to refine it into heating oil. They may decide to make gasoline or some other product. 
   Second, there is absolutely nothing that prevents this product from being shipped to foreign markets, either in its crude form or as a refined product such as heating oil. 
   Guess what. That is just what is happening. We are shipping heating oil to Europe. Look at the Wall Street Journal this morning. Let me quote:  
   Europe's market for heating oil is 50 percent bigger than the U.S. heating oil market. Europe's stocks are even tighter and prices there are a few cents a gallon higher, so U.S. refiners have renewed incentive to ship heating oil across the Atlantic....... U.S. exports of heating oil to Europe have ballooned nearly six times, in the first 7 months of this year.......  
   That tells the story of the arrangement that the administration made to take the oil out of SPR and increase our heating oil supply. What has happened with it is it is going to Europe. I am not surprised by this, in the sense of the market going to the highest price where it can generate a return. But I am astonished about the claim of the administration and those who support the movement of SPR, and the release, that it was done because of concerns over supply for the benefit of the American consumer. The American consumer has not benefited. This is a spin being put on by the pundits. 
   I asked the Secretary of Energy pointblank at a hearing last week:  
   Is it possible as a result of oil being released from SPR that prices could fall but no new heating oil would find its way into the U.S. heating market?  
   Do you know what the answer was? It could happen. The irony is that we are going to release oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve to provide product to a European market. That should not be lost on the American consumer or Members of this body. 
   Finally, SPR was created for one specific purpose: as a reserve in case our supply, our dependence on OPEC and other countries, is disrupted. We are 58-percent dependent on imported oil. We have a situation in the Mideast. Iraq is claiming Kuwait is stealing its oil, the same claim it made prior to the Persian Gulf war. Kuwait is now claiming Iraq stole oil during the gulf war. The entire Israeli-Palestinian peace process appears, unfortunately, to have fallen apart. All this leads to a reminder that we should not use our petroleum reserve for political purposes, and that appears to be what we have done in this arrangement. 
   Mr. President, how much time is remaining on this side?

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as a consequence of the focus on energy between our two Presidential candidates, it is very appropriate that we identify differences. 
   The Vice President has said he has an energy plan that focuses not only on increasing the supply but also on working on the consumption side, but the real facts are the Vice President does not practice what he preaches. Let's look at the record over the last 7 1/2 years. 
   The administration has opposed domestic oil exploration and production. We have had 17 percent less production since Clinton-Gore took office, and the facts are it decreased the number of oil wells from 136,000 and the number of gas wells has decreased by 57,000. These are wells that have actually been closed since 1992. There has been absolutely no utilization of American coal in coal-fired electric generating plants. We have not built a new plant since 1990. 
   The difficulty is the Environmental Protection Agency has made it so uneconomic that the industry simply cannot get the permits. We force the nuclear energy to choke on its own waste. We were one vote short in the Senate to pass a veto override. Yet the U.S. Court of Appeals has given the industry a liability case in the Court of  Claims, with a liability to the taxpayers of somewhere between $40 billion and $80 billion. 
   The administration threatens to tear down hydroelectric dams out West. What are we going to do there? We are going to take the traffic off the rivers and put it on the highways. We have ignored electric reliability and supply concerns. Go out to California, particularly San Diego, where they have seen price spikes and brownouts, no new generation, no new transmission. This has happened on the Vice President's watch. 
   Natural gas prices in the last 10 months have gone from $2.60 to $5.40 for delivery. That is the problem we are facing, and that is the record under this administration. 
   Let's not forget one more thing. The Vice President talks about cutting taxes. The Vice President himself cast the vote in 1993 to raise the gas tax 4.3 cents a gallon. He did not just cast the vote; he broke the tie, and that is the significance of the record with regard to a contribution to 
   increase domestic energy in this country. Instead of doing something to increase domestic oil supply, the Vice President and the administration would rather blame big oil profiteering, and that is ironic. Where was big oil a year ago when oil was selling for $10 a barrel? Who was profiteering then, Mr. President?

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from West Virginia. I sympathize with the exposure that his State has. Of course, my State, unfortunately, is not connected to the rest of the United States by rail. We have a State-owned railroad and would like to have the opportunity to have a railroad connection. I am sympathetic to his cause.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to address a couple of situations that I think are paramount in our consideration of issues before us today. I know most of my colleagues are aware of the current situation in Belgrade and the uprising against the dictatorship of Milosevic. I understand the situation is very grave at this time. I know we are all hopeful there will be no serious loss of life as a result of the uprising. I am sure my colleagues will join me in our prayers and hopes that the opposition's Kostunica will be successful in ousting Milosevic and instituting a democratic and peaceful new government in Yugoslavia. I know the Senate hopes for the best and that the nightmare in Yugoslavia may soon be at an end.  
   Unfortunately, we have a similar situation in the Middle East and the fighting that is going on between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Over 67 people have been killed. 
   I think it appropriate at a time when we are facing an energy crisis in this country to recognize the volatility associated with the area where we are most dependent on our oil supply; namely, the Middle East. Fifty-eight percent of our oil is imported primarily from OPEC. 
   As we look at the situation today, we recognize the fragility, if you will, and the sensitivity associated with relying on that part of the world, particularly when we see the action by this administration in the last few days of drawing down oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve which is set up for the specific purpose of ensuring that we have an adequate supply in storage if, indeed, our supply sources are interrupted. 
   By drawing that reserve down 30 million barrels, we sent a signal to OPEC that we were drawing down own our savings account making us more vulnerable, if you will, to those who hold the leverage on the supply of oil; namely, OPEC, Venezuela, Mexico, and other countries. 
   I wanted to make that observation and further identify, if you will, that we have a situation that needs correction. We still have time to do it in this body; that is, to pass the EPCA reauthorization bill. 
   As a consequence of the effort by the majority leader yesterday to bring that bill up--H.R. 2884--the reauthorization bill, I think it is important that we recognize why we need it. 
   First, it reauthorizes the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The authorization expired in March of this year. 
   It creates a home heating oil reserve with a proper trigger mechanism that is needed. 
   It provides State-led education programs on ``summer fill" and fuel budgeting programs. 
   It requires the Secretary of Defense to concur with drawdowns and indicate that those drawdowns will not impact national security. 
   It strengthens weatherization programs by increasing the per-dwelling allowance. 
   It requires yearly reports on the status of fuel supply prior to the heating season. 
   We have worked hard at trying to bring this to the floor and get it passed. 
   Yesterday, the Senator from California indicated there was still opposition to the bill. It is my understanding that comments were made about the bipartisan substitute we have offered. As a consequence, I believe there is a need for a response. 
   One, the Senator claimed that we could take up and pass the underlying bill--H.R. 2884--without amendment. 
   This simply can't happen. The underlying bill does not contain responsible trigger mechanisms to protect SPR from inappropriate withdrawal. 
   The Secretary of Energy has asked for a more responsible trigger mechanism than is contained in the underlying bill. The Secretary is right. We need that. This is our insurance policy if we have a blowup in the Middle East. 
   Second, by accepting the House bill, we would lose the opportunity to strengthen the weatherization program contained in the substitute and we would also lose the mandate for a yearly report from the Department of Energy on the status of our fuel heading into the winter contained in the substitute. 
   These are important issues. I am sure the Senator from California would agree that she would support these. 
   But, as a consequence, to suggest that we can accept the House bill that doesn't include the triggering mechanism is the very point that I want to bring up. 
   The Senator from California also said the Federal Government should not be in the oil business and that they don't do well in the oil business. I certainly agree. We don't do well with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We have bought high and sold low out of that reserve. 
   But it is even more important now that we have moved some of our oil to build up a heating oil reserve. 
   Isn't it ironic that the facts are, since the beginning of this year, more than 152,000 barrels of distillate--heating oils, light diesels, and so forth--have been exported each day. We are exporting fuel oils and heating oils that we ought to be holding in our reserve since we have a shortage of heating oil for the Northeast States that are so dependent on it. That is not what we are doing. 
   According to today's Wall Street Journal, that number is ballooning even higher because of tight supplies and higher prices in Europe. In other words, we need more of it here, but we are sending it over to Europe--as opposed to the administration putting a closure or requiring that crude oil be taken out of SPR and be refined for heating oil and held in this country in reserve. 
   That isn't in the requirement for the 30 million barrels that went out of SPR. The companies that bid on it can do whatever they wish with it. So we haven't accomplished anything. Where is it going? It is going to Europe. 
   I agree with the Senator from California that the Federal Government should not be in the oil business. They are doing a lousy job of it, and their SPR withdrawal is strictly a political cover to try to imply that the administration is doing something about the crisis so we don't get too excited about the election that is coming up. It is a charade. 
   The Senator from California claims the royalty-in-kind provisions are a charade allowing oil companies to pay fair market value--and this Senator is trying to undercut efforts to resolve valuation issues. 
   While I would like to take credit for all the provisions in our bill, in fairness, they were worked out with the ranking member of the committee, Senator BINGAMAN, and the administration. In fact, the royalty-in-kind program was initiated in 1994 by none other than Vice President GORE as part of the reinvention of government to test new, more efficient ways of collecting its royalty share. 
   If the Senator from California is saying that AL GORE's efforts to reinvent government have been a failure and have cost the American taxpayer millions of dollars, I would certainly respect her opinion. 
   Furthermore, a provision requires that the Government receive benefits ``equal to or greater'' than it would have received under a 
   royalty evaluation program. 
   Finally, the Senator accused me--the Senator from Alaska--of trying to move this program ``in the dark of night.'' 
   Well, I am disappointed by that statement. Prior to even taking this substitute up on the floor, my staff approached the staff of the Senator from California to work to resolve concerns in a good-faith effort. 
   The staff of Senator BINGAMAN, the ranking member of the Energy Committee, which I chair, spent countless hours answering the Senator's questions and addressing her concerns. Unfortunately, those efforts evidently have been unsuccessful. 
   So any argument that the RIK language in this bill has not gone through an appropriate process pales in comparison to that alleged lack of process involved in a ``rider'' on the same subject the Senator from California supports in the Interior appropriations bill. 
   You cannot have it both ways. 
   The arguments are simply empty rhetoric premised on the assumption that oil companies are inherently bad and any program dealing with them must be flawed. The implication is that the oil companies are profiteering. 
   There is no mention that we were selling oil in this country at $10 a barrel a year ago. Now it is $33 a barrel. 
   Who sets the price of oil? Is it ``Big Oil'' in the United States? No. It is OPEC. OPEC provides 58 percent of the supply. It is Venezuela and Mexico. You pay the price, or you leave it. 
   I am prepared to bring up this bill under a reasonable time agreement, debate the issue at length, and have the Senator from California offer an amendment to strike the provision if she finds it objectionable. That is her right. I support that right. 
   But it is time we move the Senate version of this very important bill to reauthorize the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and establish a home heating oil reserve, and get the administration focused on the reality that the oil they propose to take out of SPR is being refined and sent over to Europe to meet  their heating oil demands. 
   That is the reality. 
   If we don't move this legislation, the Senator from California will have to bear the responsibility. It is unconscionable to me at a time when we face an energy crisis--not only oil and natural gas but other areas and in our electric industry--that we find some other important bills being held up. We have passed out of the Committee an electric power reliability bill. The purpose was the recognition that we have a shortage of generating capability in this country. 
   We have not expanded our generating capacity to meet the demand. As a consequence of that, we have not progressed with a distribution system to meet the demand that is growing. So out of the Committee, along with Senator GORTON, we specifically worked to get an electric power reliability bill. It is sitting here waiting for passage. What it does--and the administration wants it--it sets up a way to share the shortage. 
   That sounds ironic, but we have a shortage of generating capacity. We have seen spiking costs very high, hundreds and thousands of dollars, for short periods of time. The reliability bill administers in a fair manner, to ensure that if there is any surplus in one area, it is moved to other areas without the exposure of spiking. We cannot seem to move that on the floor of the other body. We are going into a timeframe where, if we get a cold winter and higher electric demands, we will need that legislation. 
   Another bill, of course, that we considered is our electricity deregulation bill, a comprehensive bill. The problem was there was a mandate to have 7 1/2 percent of our energy derived from renewables. That is easy to say. The administration mandated that bill. But there is no way to enforce it because we simply don't have the technical capability to achieve 7 1/2 percent of our energy from non-hydro renewables. It is less than 2 percent now. 
   They say we haven't spent enough money or been dedicated or made a commitment. I remind my colleagues, we have extended in 5 years $1.5 billion in direct spending to subsidize development of renewables. We have given tax incentives for renewables of $4.9 billion. I support renewables, but we just can't pick them up. The wind doesn't always blow outside. In my State of Alaska, it is not always sunny. Solar panels do not always work. 
   As a consequence, I remind my colleagues, when you fly out of Washington from time to time, you don't leave here on hot air, you need energy. We have a crisis. We have not passed the electric power reliability legislation, we have not passed comprehensive electricity deregulation, and we are in a situation where we have taken oil from SPR and now we are seeing that oil move to Europe. 
   I want to use the remaining time to do a contrast because I want to emphasize the significance of the energy policies as proposed by our two Presidential candidates. Make no mistake, on energy policy the differences between Vice President GORE and Governor Bush could not be more clear. 
   Let's look at costs. We have added up the Bush proposal, $7.1 billion over 10 years. The Gore proposal, which the newspapers have added up--which are usually somewhat favorable to the Vice President--costs 10 times more than that, somewhere between $80 and $125 billion. They are still trying to pin down the figures. The Vice President wants to raise prices and limit supply of fossil energy, which makes up over 80 percent of our energy needs. By discouraging domestic production, the administration has forced us to be more dependent on foreign oil, placing our national security at risk and, of course, raising prices. 
   The Vice President's only answer in the first debate was to give you solar, wind, biomass technologies, that are not yet available. Again, I remind my colleagues, we have spent $1.5 billion in direct spending and $4.9 billion in tax incentives over 5 years trying to develop more renewables. 
   In contrast, Governor Bush would expand domestic production of 
   oil and natural gas, reduce imports below 50 percent, and ensure affordable and secure supplies by developing resources at home. He would invest ample resources into emerging clean fossil technologies, renewable energy, and energy conservation programs, but, most of all, he won't bet on our energy future. Governor Bush will use the energy of today to yield cleaner, more affordable energy sources for tomorrow. 
   Now, let's look at the record. The Vice President has said he has an energy plan that focuses not only on increasing the supply but also working on the consumption side. The facts show the Vice President doesn't practice what he preaches. The administration has actually decreased energy supply during the past 7 1/2 years. They have opposed domestic oil production and exploration. We have 17 percent less production since Clinton-Gore took office. We have closed 136,000 oil wells and 57,000 gas wells since 1992. They oppose the use of plentiful American coal and clean coal technology. The EPA makes it uneconomical to have a coal-generating plant. The demand is there for energy, but clearly coal is simply almost off limits because of the process. 
   We force the nuclear industry to choke on its waste. We are one vote short in this body of passing a veto override, yet the U.S. court of appeals, in a liability case, ruled the Government had the responsibility to take the waste. The cost to the taxpayers here is somewhere between $40 and $80 billion in liability due the industry as a consequence of the Federal Government's failure to honor the sanctity of the contract. 
   They have threatened to tear down hydroelectric dams. Where are they going to place the traffic that moves on barges? Put it on the highways? That will take away 10 percent of our Nation's electricity. 
   They ignored electric power reliability and supply concerns. Go out to San Diego and see the price spikes there--no new generation, no new transmission in southern California. 
   They have claimed to support increased use of natural gas, yet they have kept Federal lands off limits to natural gas production; approximately 64 percent of the overthrust belt in the Midwest--Wyoming, Colorado, Montana--is off limits to exploration. We all remember in this body the Vice President coming and sitting as President of the Senate, utilizing his tie-breaking vote in 1993 to raise the gas tax. 
   We recall initially he wanted a Btu tax to reduce consumption of energy when the administration first came in. There has been a series of taxes. We heard a lot about it in the debate the other day. The Vice President said the tax plan favors the richest 1 percent. Yet 2 percent of the people pay 80 percent of the taxes. He didn't mention that. 
   Talking about crude oil and the Vice President, instead of doing something to increase the domestic supply of oil, the Vice President seems to want to blame big oil for profiteering as a cause for high prices. This simply is an effort to distract attention from the real problems, to cover for this Administration's lack of a real energy strategy. 
   One year ago, oil was being given away at $10 a barrel. Who was profiteering, Mr. Vice President? Were American oil companies simply being generous? The small U.S. companies-- ``Small Oil''--were suffering, with 136,000 stripper and marginal oil wells closed. Our domestic energy industry was in real trouble. Stripper wells cannot make it at $10 a barrel. 
   The six largest oil companies--AL GORE's ``big oil''--only comprise 15 percent of the world oil market. In contrast, OPEC--Saudi Arabia, Iran, Venezuela, Mexico, Iraq--produce 30 million barrels a day and control 41 percent of the world's oil market. OPEC controls the supply. Therefore, they set the price, not the United States. 
   If we don't like their price, I guess we don't have to buy their oil. But obviously we are addicted to it. By discouraging 
   domestic exploration and increasing our reliance on foreign oil, the Vice President would take away that option, essentially, forcing us to pay OPEC's price for oil, holding us hostage to foreign governments, as the case is now. 
   What about Governor Bush? He would encourage new domestic oil and gas explorations. As he said Tuesday: The only way to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore at home. Charity begins at home.  
   Just opening up the ANWR Coastal Plain in my State of Alaska to exploration would increase domestic production by a million barrels a day. I bet it would drop the price of oil $10 to $15 a barrel. The same amount, a million barrels a day, is slightly more than what we import from Iraq. Here is a person we don't trust, whom we fought a war against, yet we are dependent on, and that is Saddam Hussein. Shouldn't we produce this oil at home rather than risk our national security by relying on Iraq for energy needs? 
   Yesterday I gave a few facts, not fiction, about oil exploration and gas exploration in my State. My colleague from Nevada, who is not on the floor today, continued to refer to outdated estimates and recoverable oil from ANWR using oil prices. He said at a price of $18 a barrel, ANWR was likely to yield a low-end estimate of 2.4 billion barrels, but that still is 1 million barrels a day for 6 years, Mr. President. 
   And the prices will be much higher than that--they will be $25 a barrel, or more. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the ANWR Coastal Plain is likely to yield 10 billion barrels of recoverable oil, nearly as much as Prudhoe Bay. But it is interesting to reflect on Prudhoe Bay because that one area has supplied one-fifth of our oil needs for the last 20 years. ANWR could do the same for the next 20 years. Remember the realities associated with estimates. They estimated Prudhoe Bay would produce 10 billion barrels, and it has produced over 12 billion and is still producing over a million a day. 
   I want to talk about natural gas because Governor Bush's energy plan is more than just increasing the domestic supply of oil. He would also expand access to natural gas on Federal lands and build more gas pipelines. 
   The Vice President makes no mention of natural gas, leaving the most critical part of America's energy mix policy simply unsaid. Yet natural gas is vital for home heating and electric power. 50 percent of U.S. homes, 56 million, use natural gas for heating. Natural gas provides 15 percent of our Nation's electric power, and that generating capability has no place to go for more capacity other than natural gas because you can't get permitted. Mr. President, 95 percent of our new electric power plants will be powered by natural gas as the fuel of choice, but this administration refuses to allow the exploration and production of gas, or the construction of pipelines, to increase the supply of gas to customers. 
   Demand has gone up faster than supply. This yields higher prices. And our demand for gas will only increase. The EIA expects natural gas consumption to increase from 22 trillion cubic feet now to 30 to 35 trillion cubic feet by 2010. 
   The administration touts natural gas as its bridge to the energy future--our cleanest fossil fuel--fewer emissions, efficient end use for industrial and residential applications, huge domestic supply, no need to rely on imports. Yet they place Federal lands off limits to new natural gas production. Where are we going to get it? Mr. President, 64 percent of the Rocky Mountain overthrust belt is off limits. The roadless policy of the Foreign Service locks up 40 million acres of public land, and there is a moratorium on OCS drilling until 2012. Where is it going to come from, thin air?

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think Senator DOMENICI will be seeking recognition. First, I want to take 2 minutes to alert my colleagues to what I think is a very significant issue. 
   Much has been made of late about the status of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the recommendation by Vice President GORE that we withdraw 30 million barrels out of the SPR so we can build up our heating oil reserve. Let me tell you what is happening to that. 
   The administration forgot a very important detail when they put that oil up to bid for the refiners. They didn't mandate that the crude oil be refined into heating oil or that it be used to build inventories here in the United States for the benefit of the Northeast States that need that heating oil inventories built up. 
   What will happen to the crude oil or refined product? It will go into the marketplace, and it is going to Europe because Europe is paying a higher price for heating oil than the United States. Currently, 167,000 barrels a day of distillate is exported. 
   Let me tell you what came out of the Houston Chronicle, and I quote:  
   The buyers can do what they wish with the oil, such as sell or swap it, said Department of Energy spokesperson Drew Malcomb, although whoever ends up with the oil has to get it out of storage by the end of November. 
   The extra crude won't result in any additional heating oil because all the heating oil facilities already are operating at maximum capacity, Brown said.  
   There you have it. You have an administration that said we had an emergency, we had to go into SPR, address our heating oil situation, while sending a message to the Mideast that we are reducing our savings account. Then we find we may not build up our domestic heating oil inventories at all with this oil, it is going up for sale into the market and ending up in Europe because the administration didn't mandate that if you bought the oil, you had to keep it here in the United States. 
   Senator STEVENS and I have experienced some demands relative to our inability to move our oil out of our State. 
   It is inconsistent to me that the administration could make such a poor business deal. We have not accomplished anything with SPR. We have simply increased our exports of heating oil. I think it is a charade. 
   I thank my colleague from New Mexico. But I did want to call that to your attention.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, if this country is ever going to achieve the goal of reducing our dependency on foreign sources of oil to at least 50 percent, we are going to have to provide incentives that will encourage our energy industry to recover oil and gas from nonconventional sources. 
   In the aftermath of the twin oil shocks of the 1970s, Congress enacted Section 29 of the tax code which provides a tax credit to encourage production of oil and gas from unconventional sources such as Devonian shale, tight rock formations, coalbeds and geopressurized brine. This credit has helped the industry invest in new technologies which allow us to recover large oil and gas deposits that are locked in various formations which are very expensive to develop. 
   Since the Clinton-Gore Administration came into office, it has sent up various proposals all designed to eliminate the Section 29 credit. As a result of their efforts, the Section 29 credit has not applied to any facilities placed in service since July 1, 1998. That makes absolutely no sense when we realize that today we are 56 percent dependent on foreign sources of oil. Doing away with this credit sends a direct signal to the market--this country will not lift a finger to encourage energy development at home. 
   I think it is time to reverse the failed energy policies of the Clinton-Gore administration. As part of that effort, I am today introducing legislation that would extend the Section 29 credit until 2013 and allow it to apply to facilities that are placed in service before 2011. I am pleased that Senators BREAUX and Stevens are joining me in this effort. 
   Mr. President, if we are to retain the prosperity we have enjoyed over the last 20 years, we must have a stable and secure supply of oil and natural gas. Section 29 is an important provision that will allow our energy development companies to bring technologies on line to develop new energy deposits. 
   Moreover, the bill expands the definition of qualifying investments to include heavy oil. In Alaska, there are several billion barrels of heavy oil in West Sak Prudhoe Bay that are just too costly to exploit because of the density of the oil and the fact that it is heavily laden with sand. Extension of the Section 29 credit could very well mean that these billions of barrels of heavy oil could be exploited and brought onto the U.S. energy market.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today the Senate will resume consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 4578, the Interior appropriations bill. It is hoped that all debate and a vote on the conference report can be completed by midafternoon. Following the disposition of the Interior appropriations legislation, the Senate may begin consideration of any other conference report available for action or the continuing resolution which continues Government funding through October 14. I encourage those Senators with statements regarding the Interior appropriations conference report to come to the floor as soon as possible during today's session. I thank my colleagues for their cooperation. 
   I believe Senator SCHUMER has asked to be recognized upon the conclusion of my remarks. I also believe Senator GORTON, who will be managing the Interior appropriations bill, is expected to come over and may ask to interrupt the presentation at that time.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, like millions of Americans last night, I watched the Presidential debate with a great deal of interest. It was one of the more memorable debates in recent history for a number of reasons. 
   First, of course, as a Republican, I was very proud of the job that Governor Bush did. It is probably fair to say that he was matched against a very experienced debater, Vice President GORE, but I think the Governor held his own in many respects. From the broad issues of prescription drugs to Medicare, education to energy, Governor Bush very clearly laid out what the choice is for the American people in this election. 
   Governor Bush engaged the issues. They were not dodged. The Governor was clear in laying out the goals and objectives he would propose in his administration, if he were elected President. 
   I was particularly pleased with the debate because it focused on energy, which is one of the crucial issues facing the American people today and has probably received the least publicity. Obviously, in the areas of education, prescription drugs, health, and Social Security, we are all trying to build a better structure, a long lasting structure, and also address what to do with the surplus. 
   But the issue on energy is quite clear. We have a crisis in this country. It has developed over a period of the last 7 1/2 years. It has not been addressed by the current administration. I am very pleased that we have, in the energy area, a distinct separation on the issues between the candidates, and the American public can clearly understand and, as a consequence, view the merits of each proposal. 
   The Vice President said, in regard to a question on energy policy, and I quote:  
   I am for doing something on the supply side and the consumption side.  
   I have no doubt that that is the case, but I point out in the past 8 years we haven't had any indication of specifically what the Vice President would do on these issues. As a consequence, I think he is headed in the wrong direction, and the American public are becoming more and more aware. 
   What we have seen happen is the emergence of an issue that in many respects our friends on the other side of the aisle hope will go away or not become a major issue prior to the election. With the increasing rise in crude oil--10 days ago it was up to an all-time high in 10 years of $37; it dropped down with the SPR release; now it is coming up again--the American public is becoming aware of how crucial not our dependence on imported oil necessarily is but the general concern that we have sacrificed our traditional areas of dependence on energy, whether it be coal, nuclear, or hydro, for a policy that has been fostered by this administration that directs everything towards utilization of natural gas. 
   As a consequence, we have seen the price of natural gas rise from $2.16 per thousand cubic feet 10 months ago to better than $5.00 in the last quotes that have come out within the last couple weeks. We have seen a tremendous increase in the dependence on natural gas at the expense of all our other energy sources. 
   This has occurred over an 8-year period of time. During that time, Clinton-Gore have to stand accountable for what they have done. On the supply side, the Vice President has done something. It is a situation that the supplies have decreased 18 percent and on the consumption side, consumption has increased 14 percent. In spite of our efforts for conservation, in spite of our efforts in alternative energy, we have a decreased supply and an increased consumption. 
   I was astonished when the Vice President said in his response to a question on energy policy, and again I quote:  
   We need to get serious about this energy crisis in the Congress and in the White House.  
   Where has he been for the last 7 1/2 years? While I don't agree with him in terms of Congress not being serious, I was glad to see they finally admitted it was not an issue taken seriously in the White House for the past 7 1/2 years. That was certainly the implication. 
   We have had statements from our Secretary of Energy relative to the fact that the administration was caught napping with regard to energy prices, as we have seen the price of oil go from $10 a barrel a year ago to $37 within the last few weeks. 
   Now, I think, while it didn't come up in the debate last night specifically, there was a generalization to blame big oil. Well, who is big oil, Mr. President? Who sets the price of oil? We had a hearing before the Energy and Natural Resource Committee, which I chair. It was rather interesting because the Secretary of Energy did acknowledge that it is OPEC, the supplier, setting the price of oil. We are 58-percent dependent on OPEC. Who is OPEC? The Mideast countries that have the excess capacity, such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and moving down to Central America is Venezuela, and then we also have Mexico. They have the supply; we have the appetite. They set the price. So to blame big oil for profiteering, or to make the implication of profiteering, is totally unrealistic and a bit irresponsible, in my opinion. There is no mention, of course, in general terms of the assumption that perhaps our oil industry was simply benevolent when they were selling at $10 a barrel a little more than a year ago. They are not so benevolent now because, obviously, they don't set the price. It is a supply and demand issue. 
   When the Vice President said we needed to get serious about the energy crisis, I think it is apparent that there has been a lack of attention during this in the administration, because Congress has acted. Specifically, Congress passed legislation granting deep water royalty relief. Congress passed legislation to help our domestic oil and gas industry through tax incentives, which they vetoed. Congress passed legislation that would handle the country's nuclear waste, which they vetoed. Congress passed legislation to open up the Coastal Plain of ANWR--that sliver in the Arctic--to responsible development, which they vetoed. That was 6 years ago. Had they passed that legislation, we would know what is there. We could have another strategic petroleum reserve, and we don't know that. We would be a long way into the development stages if indeed the oil were there. I venture to say, Mr. President, if we made a commitment to proceed with the Arctic oil reserve, you would see a dramatic drop in the price of oil. 
   One of the other interesting things the Vice President brought up was the implication that we hadn't done anything, or not enough, with renewables. In the last 5 years under the Republican Congress, expenditures for renewables have been $1.5 billion in new spending and $4.5 billion in various tax incentives. So Congress anteed up about $4.6 billion total for that purpose. The difficulty is that we simply don't have the technology to replace our oil dependence with coal, natural gas, and hydrogen. 
   Let's not be fooled. It is not just around the corner. The Vice President said last night he is a big clean coal fan. Well, what does that really mean? You would assume he would support the development of coal-fired generating plants in this country. There hasn't been a new one built in years. The administration's budget over the last 5 years has proposed to rescind or defer more than $1.4 billion in clean coal technology. Those are the facts. 
   How can you be all things to all people? Well, Vice President GORE implies he is pretty good at that. Let's talk a little bit about the facts because part of the issue that came up on energy was the disposition of the Coastal Plain in Alaska, the State I represent. I know something about it. I have been to the coastal plain many, many times. I think once again we saw the Vice President in trouble with the facts. This is what he said regarding the Arctic Coastal Plain, and I quote:  
   I think that is the wrong choice. It would only give us a few months' worth of oil, and oil would not start flowing for years into the future.  
   Well, the facts are, according to the Department of Energy--the Clinton-  Gore Department of Energy--this area could be the largest field ever discovered in North America--possibly 16 billion barrels of recoverable oil. If that high estimate of oil is found, it could produce over 20 percent of our current domestic production levels for the next 20 years. If the high estimate is 
   found, it would be larger than Prudhoe Bay, which has been doing just that--producing 20 to 25 percent of our oil for almost the last 25 years. 
   I am not surprised that Vice President GORE has a problem with the facts on this issue. One need only read his official position on why he wants to ``protect the Arctic Coastal Plain'' to see that he is terribly misinformed. He says, ``The wildlife refuge's Coastal Plain--where drilling would occur--is home to polar bears, grizzlies and black bear, Dall sheep, wolves and moose.'' 
   I know something about this area. I assure you there are no black bears and no Dall sheep in the Coastal Plain. Dall sheep are a mountainous species, and perhaps some Members in this body would have you believe otherwise, but there are no mountains in the Coastal Plains. It is very flat for miles and miles and miles. 
   What did Governor Bush say? Well, Governor Bush said it is better to produce energy here at home, where we can do it in an environmentally sound manner than to continue relying on imported sources of energy. I particularly agree that it is better that we explore at home, using our technology and environmental sensitivity, and do it right, rather than going over to the rain forests in Colombia, where there are no environmental constraints and they would ship it into this country on foreign tankers, which have the exposure to an accident off our shores by companies that don't have the deep pockets associated with the tragic accident that occurred in my State. Nevertheless, it seems as if this administration would continue to rely on the likes of Saddam Hussein for our energy security. That is about where we are. 
   I am going to conclude my presentation this morning on one segment of our energy policy that needs clarification. It is an issue that the environmental community has perpetrated on our American citizens; that is, that there is something extraordinarily unique, and there is something that, by its implication, suggests that we cannot explore and, if we find hydrocarbons, develop them safely. That is the argument over ANWR--or, as we refer to it, the Coastal Plain--a small portion of the area which is proposed to be opened for exploration and can only be done by the Congress of the United States. 
   Before I go into it, I think the public should be aware of another fact that has come up. You will recall the other day the Vice President recommended to the President that we release crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, about 30 million barrels. That 30 million barrels was estimated to be a supply of heating oil, after it was refined, that would equal about a 3-day supply. I think it was about 3 or 4 million barrels of heating oil we would get out of that release. 
   I think it is also interesting to recognize that in the wintertime we consume about 4 million barrels of distillate--including heating oil a day. What I can't understand is the reality that we are exporting heating oil--heating oil that ordinarily you would assume would be going into inventories to meet the anticipated winter demand for heating oil in the Northeast Corridor. More than 117,000 barrels per day of distillate, as I understand it, are being shipped over to Europe and other places. 
   If the President has the power--which he certainly and evidently has taken--to remove oil from the SPR, why would he not prohibit the export of any heating oil refined from that oil? It is diesel that is going overseas currently. It doesn't make sense. I will have more information specifically, but they seem to have overlooked this in their euphoria to get the word out that indeed they are doing something positive about the shortage in the Northeast Corridor for heating oil, and the fact we are allowing a refined product to go to Europe is unconscionable and certainly goes against the argument that we needed to release oil from SPR. 
   Let me get into my presentation this morning because I want to try to communicate what this issue is about--ANWR, what are the facts and what is the fix. Hopefully, we can address that this morning since this issue has been brought up in the Presidential debates and clearly is attracting the attention of the American people, many of whom simply don't have an appreciation because they have never been there. 
   My State of Alaska is a pretty big piece of real estate. It is one-fifth the size of the lower United States. If you overlay Alaska over the entire lower United States, it will range from Canada to Mexico and Florida to California over to the Aleutian Islands 1,000 miles out to the west. 
   This little portion up here of our State is called the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge--perhaps inaccurately named because not all of it is a refuge nor all of it a wildlife area. There is an area that was carved out by Congress in 1980. In their wisdom, Congress took this area, which is 19 million acres--the size of the State of South Carolina--and said let's make a wilderness out of part of it and a wildlife refuge out of the other part. They took 8.5 million acres and made a wilderness in perpetuity; it is not going to be changed. They made another 9 million acres into what we call a refuge. But they left this area called the Coastal Plain, or the 1002 area, out of any permanent land designation until Congress made its determination as to its status. 
   During this time, there were certain activities with regard to oil and gas exploration, and it was suggested that there might be a significant reserve in this general area. 
   As you know, Prudhoe Bay is here--not too far away. That is where we have been producing about 25 percent of the total crude oil produced in this country. We built an 800-mile pipeline down to Valdez where the oil flows and moves down to the west coast of the United States. This infrastructure is already there. There was a construction project of about $7.5 billion to $8 billion, the largest construction project ever built in North America. It was designed to handle a little better than 2 million barrels of crude oil a day. Currently it is handling a little over 1 million barrels a day. So there is an unused capacity in existence there for over 1 million barrels a day. It would require no further adjustment of any kind. 
   The idea here is, should we allow exploration in this area and put it up for Federal leases? If we do, can we do it safely? 
   Of course, the proposal in Governor Bush's energy presentation is to take the revenue of some $3 billion anticipated from Federal leases as well as the federal royalty share and put that back into conservation issues, renewable energy technologies, home heating, and weatherization programs; in other words, take the revenue and try to do something positive for people to lower costs associated with high energy costs. 
   That is a significant step that suggests we can use the revenue which the private sector will pay and do something very positive with it, and address, if you will, environmental issues that need regeneration in other parts of the country with this revenue. The whole question, of course, is the status of this area and whether Congress is going to see fit to open it up. 
   I am going to go through the arguments because I think they really mandate an understanding so that there can be an appreciation of the merits of this. The first argument that is used in the fictional sense is the assumption that 95 percent of this area is already open to oil development. 
   Here is the area we are talking about. Only a part of the 1,500 mile Arctic Coastline is left open for possible development. Only 14 percent of the whole 1,500-mile Coastal Plain in Alaska is open to oil exploration today--not 95 percent but 14 percent. 
   Here is the area. This is closed. This area is open. Some of this happens to be State lands. And, except for a small part of the coastline, the coastline of the national petroleum reserve is 
   closed clear over to Point Hope. To suggest that 95 percent of the area is already open is totally inaccurate. 
   I will certainly look forward to a spirited debate on this subject if somebody wants to take me up on it, including members of the environmental groups.  
   We also have 8 million acres of ANWR, as I have indicated, in a permanent wilderness. Another 9.5 million acres is classified as refuge; that is, 95 percent of the entire range is closed to exploration and oil development. It is closed. 
   Using modern technology--there is the point I want to highlight--the indications are that we would need only 2,000 acres out of the 19 million acres to develop the proposed oil fields that are believed to exist in the ANWR Coastal Plain. That is a pretty small footprint when you consider this ANWR area is about the size of the State of South Carolina. We are talking about a 2,000-acre footprint, if given the opportunity. That is about one-tenth of 1 percent of the 1.5 million acres, the 1002 area, and only 1 and one-hundredth percent of the entire 19-million acre ANWR area. 
   These are the misconceptions that have been forced on the American people relative to the significance of what development could take place, how small the footprint is, and how large overall the area is, and little attention has been given to the infrastructure that is already there. 
   I also remind people that this is not an untouched area. There is a distant early warning radar site there. There is a Native village of Kaktovik right in the middle of it where nearly 300 Eskimo people make their living and pursue a subsistence lifestyle. It is interesting to note that about 70 percent of the people in the village support opening the area because they want to have an opportunity for an alternative standard of living and lifestyle: Should they choose to foster just subsistence, or should they pursue opportunities for jobs. 
   Another fiction is that opening up the Coastal Plain would destroy the biological part of the wildlife refuge. That really sounds good. But let's look at it for a minute. 
   The Coastal Plain can be opened to development without harm to the wildlife and the environment. Even the Eskimo inhabitants of Kaktovik who depend on subsistence hunting and fishing to eke out their living in the far north are convinced that oil development can be done safely, because of the safeguards, without harm to their land and the wildlife on which they depend for their heritage. 
   Under legislation I have proposed, No drilling or development activities would be allowed during the caribou calving season. Limits would be placed on exploration, development, and related activities to avoid impacts on fish and wildlife. Initial exploration efforts would be limited to a time between November and May--the Arctic winter--to guarantee that there would be no impact from exploration, pipelines, or roads on the caribou. 
   Let's look at some descriptive charts that give you an idea about the success of developing this area from what we have learned in Prudhoe Bay. 
   Here is the Prudhoe Bay area. These are not mannequins, these are real caribou. They are wandering around, and nobody is disturbing them. You cannot take a gun. There is no shooting allowed. There is no taking of game in the entire oil fields. These animals are very adjustable as long as they are not harassed. Clearly they are not harassed. 
   There is a picture of the caribou herd that happens to be going through Prudhoe Bay area. 
   The same thing is true with regard to other wildlife. This is the pipeline going to Prudhoe Bay. You can see the Arctic tundra over here. It is a pretty time. It is a wintertime picture. 
   There are three bears here. It is kind of comical because the bears are walking on the pipeline. Why? Because it is easier to walk on the pipeline than to walk in the snow. They are as smart as the average bears around here. In any case, it is a little warmer too. To suggest that somehow these animals are going to be fenced out because of some activity just isn't supported by any burden of proof. 
   We are trying to give some factual, real-life issues associated with development in the Arctic and what steps we take to protect the environment and ensure we are not going to have difficulties associated with the wildlife. 
   I also want to show you a little effort by our Canadian friends on this side when they begin to initiate an aggressive oil and gas exploration program in the Arctic. 
   This is the boundary between Canada and Alaska. This is the Northwest Territory. We see various villages. The dots represent oil wells that have been drilled for exploration purposes. Here is the village of Old Crow, just on the Canadian side of the Alaska-Canadian border. 
   My point is to show the extent of drilling on the Canadian side in the search of oil and gas. Unfortunately, they didn't find any oil and gas. This is also the route of the porcupine caribou herd. They move through the range and traverse the area. Incidentally, they cross a highway, the Dempster Highway. The Canadian Government, when they found there was no oil, decided to make it a park. As a consequence, it is a park today; that is fine. But to suggest that somehow this activity would have some effect on the migration pattern certainly proves it didn't have much of an effect, and the highway and the caribou traversing it did not have an effect on the herds. In the proposals we have for development in Alaska, the technology today is very different. 
   This photograph gives an idea of the development of an oil well in Alaska today. There are no roads, no gravel. This is an ice road. That is the technology used. They build up the ice and use it as a road. This is a well. You can see the Arctic Ocean. It is a pretty tough area. It has its own uniqueness, its own beauty, but is a very hostile environment. 
   When exploration activity is completed, this is the picture we have during the short summer. It is the same area. There is no despoiling of the tundra. This represents the technology that is available today. 
   The Coastal Plain has been declared America's last wilderness. It is not wilderness. However, an awful lot of our State is wilderness. We have 56 million acres of wilderness. The point is we protect the wilderness. We can protect these areas. 
   In our State less than 1 percent of the entire State, 365 million acres, is in private ownership and available for development. We have 192 million acres of parks, preserves, conservation system units. As I have said, there are 56 million acres of wilderness, 61 percent of all American wilderness. How much is enough? I am not here to debate. Wilderness in Alaska already covers an area equal to Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, and Maryland. 
   Further in the Coastal Plain lies this village of Eskimo people. This picture demonstrates what it is like to take a walk on the North Slope in the wintertime. There are a couple of kids in the village walking down the street. It is blowing snow. Aren't these kids entitled to a different lifestyle, should they wish? The answer clearly is yes. When they say there has been nothing in this area, they are misleading. It is inaccurate. This is the wilderness, this is the refuge, this is what Congress is debating, and this is where the oil is likely to occur in the footprint of 2,000 acres. 
   Some suggest it is only a 90-day, or a 200-day supply of oil. Prudhoe Bay was estimated to produce 9 billion barrels. It has produced over 12 billion barrels today. It is still producing over a million barrels a day. When we look at potential production, we are looking at the potential of 16 billion barrels. When we talk about a 200-day supply, we assume there will not be any oil produced from any other source. It is a fictional argument. 
   I have talked about the caribou, but I want to show again the significance of this with regard to Prudhoe Bay. This picture is a different herd than exists in the ANWR area. This is the central arctic herd. There is no indication that an environmentally responsible exploration will harm the porcupine caribou which, I might add, is 129,000 now. As a matter of fact, we have about three times as many caribou in our State as we have people--not that that is anything significant, but it is a fact. We have had 26 years in Prudhoe Bay of protecting these animals. The central herd has grown from 3,000 animals in 1978 to 19,700 today. That is 
   a fact. 
   These arguments suggesting somehow we will decimate the wildlife simply is not based on any accurate information. It is an emotional argument. This is one of the travesties that has been taking place--exploiting the American public to suggest we cannot  open this area safely. Why has the environmental community pursued this? It generates membership. It generates dollars, gives them a cause, and it is so far away people cannot see for themselves. I can't say how many ``experts'' in this body have opinions but have never been there. Their material is written by the Wilderness Society. It is written by the Sierra Club. 
   Caribou will flourish in ANWR as they have throughout Alaska. In these areas, no hunting will be allowed by anyone other than a Native. 
   We have heard a good deal from the Gwich'in group, the group of Natives on the Canadian and the Alaskan side. The suggestion is this will destroy their culture. Nothing will prevent the caribou herd from passing close to the Gwich'in villages. That is where they yearly hunt, when they come through. They will continue to have the availability of the caribou for their subsistence. Strict controls are planned to prevent disruption of the caribou herds during the summer calving. The caribou calve in the northern area, but they calve, depending on weather schedules, snowfall, bugs, and predators--sometimes they calve on the Canadian side; sometimes they calve on the Alaskan side. The point is, the Gwich'in group that is dependent will be protected as a consequence of ensuring that there is no activity on the Arctic Slope during the time of the migration. That can be simply asserted by regulations, and we have agreed to do that. 
   It is interesting to note that the Gwich'in group, 15 years ago, issued a request for a proposal to lease their own land, about 1.7 million acres for oil development. Maybe the oil companies should have bought. Unfortunately, there wasn't any oil. As a consequence, the leases were not taken up. Now the Gwich'ins are entitled to change their mind, and that is what they have done. 
   The truth is, they are funded by the Wilderness Society. They are funded by the Sierra Club. We have tried time and time again to encourage some of the Gwich'ins to go from their traditional area and go to Point Barrow and see what the Eskimos think of resource development associated with oil and gas. 
   I recall one of my friends took a group up. He is an Eskimo from Barrow. He said he used to go to school to keep warm. But before he did, he had to go to the beach to pick up driftwood that flowed down the river--no trees, but driftwood, to keep warm. He says: We have an alternative lifestyle now. We have a choice. We can take a job. We have educational opportunities. 
   They are able to provide a full 4-year college scholarship to any member of their community who wants to go. They can do that because they have revenues associated with their Barrow's taxing base on the oil pipeline. So it has brought about an alternative in lifestyle and a choice that people previously did not have. 
   These people are entitled to the same things to which you and I are entitled, if they so choose. So when you look at these kids, look at whether or not they want to continue to rely on the subsistence economy, following game, or whether they want an opportunity to have a college education and come back, maybe, as a doctor or nurse or whatever. They are given this opportunity through activities associated with creating the tax base of their communities. Should they not be heard as well? 
   I was amused at the inconsistencies associated with the environmental community. The Audubon Society currently holds leases in the Paul J. Rainey Wildlife Preserve in Louisiana. They hold oil leases. They generate revenue. There is nothing wrong with that, but it is an inconsistency they do not care to acknowledge or admit. If it is OK for the Audubon Society to have revenues from oil in a preserve, the Paul J. Rainey Wildlife Preserve in Louisiana, why shouldn't the Natives of my State have the same opportunity for their own land? It seems to me there is certainly justification. 
   There is another myth: Canada has protected their wildlife; we should do the same. We went through that. The Canadians finally created a national park, but they did so only after extensive exploration failed. The Canadians drilled 89 exploration wells on their side with no success. They also extended the Dempster Highway, cutting across the center of the Porcupine caribou herds' route. 
   Another fiction we hear all the time: Oil exploration would destroy polar bear habitat. Doesn't that sound terrific? The reality is polar bears den on the Arctic ice pack, not on land. The administration has positively identified only 15 polar bear dens on the entire Coastal Plain for an 11-year period; that is one or two dens a year. We have a healthy population of polar bears, estimated at about 2,000. The reason is we do not shoot them. You can go to Canada and take a polar bear for a trophy. You can go to Russia. You can't do it in the United States. The only people who can take polar bear are the Native people for subsistence. The environmentalists don't tell you that. 
   However, they do tell you Prudhoe Bay has been littered with chemical and oil spills, the Arctic having been despoiled by three or four--whatever figure they want to use. But the figure that is accurate is 17,000 spills since 1970. That is the accurate figure. How can you have those spills with such a pristine environment? The fact is, as a consequence of the environmental oversight and requirements, every spill of any material--even if it is fresh water--has to be reported; any spill that is how you get 17,000 spills. 
   For example, in 1993 there were 160 spills involving 60,000 gallons. Before you jump to conclusions, only 2 spills involved oil. Roughly 9.5 gallons of oil were spilled from a leaky valve. Any oil and chemical spills have almost always been confined to frozen gravel pads where they are easily cleaned up. Moving more than 1 million barrels of oil a day, everyday, from the ground, through the pipe and onto ships--9.5 gallons of oil spilled. I think that is a remarkable record. Prudhoe Bay is the finest oil field in the world bar none. We send kids up from Anchorage and Fairbanks to pick up the few papers that happen to blow around. It is a summer job. 
   Another fiction: Producing more oil would simply cause Americans to buy more gas-guzzling cars and defeat conservation efforts. America does need to be more energy efficient. It does need to develop more alternative fuels. Even with increased energy efficiency and conservation, our energy demands are forecast to 
   increase 30 percent by the year 2010. By then, America will be producing just 5.2 million barrels of oil per day. We will be forced to import 65 percent of our oil needs. This certainly poses a threat to our national security. We would need 30 giant foreign-flagged supertankers a day, more than 10,000 a year, coming into our ports to import the oil we need. That creates much more environmental risk than developing our own resources where we have the tough environmental requirements. 
   The vast majority of Americans oppose disturbing the Alaska Arctic National Refuge--that is what the environmentalists would have you believe. Americans strongly support responsible development when they know the facts about it. That is what I have attempted to do today. 
   I encourage my colleagues to give me an opportunity to debate them if they want to challenge these facts. A poll taken by the Gordon S. Black Corp. said 56 percent of Americans support ANWR leasing; 37 percent oppose; 74 percent of Americans support efforts to produce domestic oil and natural gas. That is what Governor Bush proposed last night--producing more oil here at home and not being dependent on imports. Certainly, most Alaskans support ANWR. The entire congressional delegation, the Democratic Governor, 78 percent of the residents of Kaktovik, this little village, support it. 
   Some say what are we doing exporting from Alaska? We don't export oil from Alaska. There was some exported when we had surplus oil on the west coast of the United States. That has not occurred for several months. 
   Finally, they suggest we are a wealthy State, we don't need ANWR. That is a ridiculous argument. We have, in Alaska, the highest cost of living in the nation. We have billions of dollars of unmet infrastructure needs like sanitation for our village's health needs. We have no roads across most of Alaska. We have, probably, the most fragile economy of any State in the Union. We have always depended on resource industries, but our timber industry has been shut down by this administration. We have lost our jobs in  Ketchikan and Sitka, our only two year-round manufacturing plants. Our oil and gas jobs are down. 
   The worst thing is we have had 32,000 young Alaskans leave Alaska since 1992 as a consequence of not having opportunities for these people within our State because we are dependent on developing resources and the Federal Government controls the landmass in our State. 
   I hope as we continually debate the issues before us as we enter this Presidential campaign, and the issue of energy comes to the forefront, as it should, as a distinct issue between the two candidates, we will have a better understanding of the merits of opening up this area of the Arctic for the relief that is needed in this country today. I predict if this administration would commit to opening up this area for oil and gas leasing, you would see a drop in the price of oil overnight. As a consequence, the belief that America meant business when it said we were going to relieve our dependence on imported oil would mean we would not be subject to the whims of the individual who controls, if you will, the difference between the world's capacity to produce and the world's current demand--which is about 1.5 million barrels with supply being a little over the demand. That one person is Saddam Hussein, in Iraq, who is currently producing almost 3 million barrels a day. The fear is he will cut production. If he cuts production, we will see oil prices go from $37 to probably $60 a barrel. That, coupled with the instability associated with the current spokesperson from OPEC, from Venezuela, who has made certain suggestions that clearly the object of OPEC in Venezuela is to protect the interests of the small countries of the world at the expense of the large consumers of hydrocarbons, means we have a very unstable situation. 
   I hope the American people have a better understanding of what has happened in the last 8 years as this current administration has abandoned the traditional dependence on many sources of energy--oil, natural gas, hydrocarbons associated with our coal industry, our nuclear industry and our hydroelectric industry--and clearly focused the future on our energy supply of natural gas. 
   As a consequence, we have seen what has happened with natural gas. Demand has gone up, and we are in a situation now where other countries are dictating conditions under which we have to pay the price they charge or go without. It is strictly supply and demand. It has been coming for a long time, and the Clinton-Gore administration bears the responsibility for not having a responsible energy policy. That is why I am so pleased to see Governor Bush come forward and acknowledge what has to be done, and among those issues is more domestic production. 
   The fact he has stated the belief that we can open up this area safely I think deserves full examination and explanation to the American public. That is what I have attempted to do today. 
   I thank my colleague for the opportunity to speak in morning business. I see the floor leader, Senator GORTON, is on the floor. I believe the pending business is the Interior appropriations bill. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would hope that my colleagues who have raised an objection to the Senate taking up this legislation would reconsider. This is a very important piece of legislation. It is the reauthorization of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. 
   Senator BINGAMAN, who is the ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and myself, as chairman, have worked closely to come together with this compromise legislation. We have worked with the administration. 
   It is my understanding that the administration supports this legislation, and for good reason: Because the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, initially passed in 1975, deals with issues at hand, issues that are affecting the energy supply in this country, issues that are affecting the price of energy in this country; and issues that the administration has mandated pass the Congress of the United States, specifically, this body because these issues deal with the domestic oil supply and conservation and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the International Energy Program, or IEP, as the agreement stands. 
   Certain authorities for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or SPR, and U.S. participation in the International Energy Program expired in March of this year. The legislation before us would extend these authorizations through September 30, 2003. 
   I think it is rather ironic that we are out of compliance in the sense of having both these significant issues expire at a time when we have an energy crisis and we have not acted upon them. 
   I would like to point out several facts about the legislation before us and the need for that legislation. 
   We have seen a lot of publicity given to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the emphasis put on the significance of that as kind of a savings account for oil in case we have an interruption from our supply from overseas, a supply which currently is about 58 percent of our total consumption. 
   Title I of EPCA provided for the creation of SPR, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and set forth the method and circumstances for its drawdown and distribution in the event of a severe energy supply interruption or to fulfill U.S. obligations under the IEP agreement. 
   The SPR currently contains approximately 570 million barrels of oil and has a total capacity of about 700 million barrels, with a daily drawdown capacity of about 4.1 million barrels per day. At its peak, the SPR contained 592 million barrels of oil. Currently, the SPR contains about 570 million barrels of oil, so there has been a drawdown. 
   We have seen the action by the President in transferring 30 million barrels out of the SPR to be turned into heating oil. It is rather interesting to note that the formula doesn't necessarily relate to 30 million barrels of heating oil. We will actually get somewhere between 4 and 5 million barrels of heating oil out of 30 million barrels of crude oil, about a 2- to 3-day supply. 
   As a consequence of the President's action, there is a legitimate question of whether the President had the authority to transfer that oil out of the SPR since the authorization for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve expired March 30 of this year. In any event, there is absolutely no reason why it shouldn't be authorized, regardless of individual attitudes on the appropriateness of drawing the SPR down. 
   It was created in response to the difficulties faced in 1973, when we experienced the Arab oil embargo. Many of us remember that time. We were outraged. We had gasoline lines around the block and the public was indignant. They blamed everybody--the Government. How could it happen in the United States that we had run out of gasoline? The concept was simple. At that time, most of us believed America should not be held hostage again to Mideast oil cartels and that this would act as our protection against cutting off our supplies. Unfortunately, we find ourselves in a situation today where our domestic policies have led us to being held hostage by another tyrant. That tyrant in the Mideast is one Saddam Hussein. 
   Clearly, we are becoming more and more dependent on Saddam Hussein. Currently, 750,000 barrels a day of Saddam Hussein's oil come to the United States. It is even more significant that Saddam Hussein has taken a pivotal role in the oil issue worldwide, because the difference between production capacity and consumption is a little over 1 million barrels a day. In other words, we are producing a little over 1 million barrels more than we can consume, but that is the maximum production. Out of that, Saddam Hussein is contributing almost 3 million barrels a day. So you can see the leverage that Saddam Hussein has. He has already threatened to cut production. He went to the U.N., when they asked for specific programs for repayment of damages associated with his invasion of Kuwait. He said: If you make me do this now, what I am going to do is simply put off any further plans to increase production, and I very well may reduce production. 
   You can see the leverage he has if he reduces production. What is the world going to do? The price is going to go up, and 
   they are going to pay the price. 
   So what we have seen today is the reality that the world is consuming just slightly less oil than we are producing. Because of this, we have not been able to build up our supply of inventory against any unexpected supply interruption, which very well could occur. The Mideast is still an area of crisis and controversy. 
   Here we are, as we approach the fourth quarter of the year, and we have the difference between supply and demand, the knowledge that it is going to tighten even further, and this leads, as I have indicated, to a volatile worldwide oil market. 
   It is troubling in the United States because we have allowed ourselves to become 58-percent dependent on imported oil, and this has grown dramatically in the past few years. What disturbs me most is the fact that we have become even more dependent on Iraq. As a consequence, it is fair to recognize that with Saddam Hussein now calling the shots in the world energy markets and the United States allowing him to do so, we have basically put in danger the security of Israel. 
   Make no mistake about it. Every speech he concludes, he concludes with: Death to Israel. It is kind of ironic. Maybe I am oversimplifying our foreign policy, but it seems as though we buy his oil, put it in our airplanes and go over and bomb him. We have had  flown over 200,000 sorties since the Persian Gulf war, where we go over and enforce what amounts to an air blockade. As a consequence, we are in a situation where we are supplying the cash-flow for his Republican Guard as well as the development of his missile and delivery capability and his biological capability. This is a mistake. 
   Because of this, it is imperative that we continue to place the focus of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve on a defensive weapon against severe supply interruptions and that we do not use it as an offensive weapon to manipulate market forces. We have debated that issue on the floor before. I think this bill achieves a balance. 
   What we have in this bill is very important because many Members are from the Northeast, and this bill covers heating oil reserves. The legislation contains language authorizing the Secretary of Energy to create a home heating oil reserve in the Northeast. 
   Several points about this: First, I have personal concerns about the establishment of such a reserve. A reserve could actually act as a disincentive to marketers to keep adequate supplies of oil on hand for fear that the price could drop out of their market at any time. That is a possibility, with the Government going into competition. 
   A government-operated reserve of 2 million barrels could actually tie up storage capacity that private marketers would fill and deplete usually four or five times a season. The reserve could create an unworkable, rather elaborate regulatory program used to implement it. 
   Second, I was most concerned about the trigger mechanism included in the House language that seemingly gave the Secretary total discretionary authority to release oil from the reserve. I believe we have addressed the majority of the problems associated with the creation of such a reserve by clarifying the trigger mechanism. 
   The mechanism we have in this bill allows the Secretary to make a recommendation for release if there is a severe supply interruption. This is deemed to occur if, one, the price 
   differential between crude oil, as reflected in an industry daily publication such as Platt's Oilgram Price Report or Oil Daily, and No. 2 heating oil, as reported in the Energy Information Administration's retail price data for the Northeast, increases by more than 60 percent over its 5-year rolling average; and second, the price differential continues to increase during the most recent week for which price information is available. We have this mechanism in this legislation, and it has been agreed to by virtually every Member of this body. 
   As to EPCA reauthorization, the bill extends the general authority for EPCA through September 30, 2003. 
   On the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the authorities for SPR are extended through September 30, 2003. It strengthens the defense aspects of SPR by requiring the Secretary of Defense to affirm that a drawdown would not have a negative impact on national security. That was an important provision Senator BINGAMAN and I negotiated. 
   We also have stripper well relief, the small stripper wells that we are so dependent on that were threatened the last time we had a price downturn. The amendment retains the provision contained in the House bill that would give the Secretary of Energy discretion to purchase oil from marginal--that is 15 barrels of production daily or less--wells when the market price drops below $15. Otherwise, these wells will be lost. The cost of production to get them back up is such that they would never go on line again. This would give some certainty to these producers that we really value, the strippers, as the true strategic petroleum reserve, and an operational one, in this country. 
   This provision would hopefully offset the loss of some 600,000 b/d of lost production that occurred because of the dramatic price decrease in 1999. 
   This amendment also allows the Secretary to fill the SPR with oil bought at below average prices. 
   We have weatherization. It strengthens the DOE Weatherization program by expanding the eligibility for the program and increases the per-dwelling assistance level. 
   The Summer Fill and Fuel Program authorizes a summer fill and fuel budgeting program. 
   The program will be a state-led education and outreach effort to encourage consumers to take actions to avoid seasonal price increases and minimize heating fuel shortages--such as filling tanks in the summer. 
   The Federal Lands Survey directs the Secretary of Interior, in conjunction with the Secretaries of Agriculture and Energy, to undertake a national inventory of the onshore oil and gas reserves in this country and the impediments to developing these resources. 
   This will enable us to get a better handle on our domestic resources and the reasons why they are not being developed. 
   The DOE Arctic Energy Office establishes within the Department of Energy an Office of Arctic Energy. 
   Most of the energy in North America is coming from above the Arctic Circle. 
   The office will promote research, development, and deployment of energy technologies in the Arctic. 
   This provision is critical as the Arctic areas of this country have provided for as much as 20% of our domestic petroleum resources--have more than 36 TCF of proven reserves of gas, and an abundance of coal, as we look at future energy needs of this country. 
   It might surprise members to know that the Department of Energy employs no personnel in Alaska! 
   There is a 5 megawatt exemption that allows the State of Alaska to assume the licensing and regulatory authority over hydro projects less than 5 megawatts. 
   This will expedite the process and cost of getting this clean source of energy in wider use in Alaska. 
   The Senate has already passed this provision. 
   The justification is that there is no way a small community, a small village, can put in a small hydrobelt wheel on a stream that has no anadromous fish and generate power to replace dependence on high-cost diesel, much of which is flown in, and still meet the requirement of the FERC, which licenses these small operations. And, as a consequence, we have not been able to utilize them in many of the areas to replace the high cost of diesel. 
   We have royalty-in-kind. 
   This provision allows the Secretary of the Interior more administrative flexibility to increase revenues from the government's oil and gas royalty-in-kind program. 
   Under current law, the government has the option of taking its royalty share either as a portion of production, usually one-eighth or one-sixth, or its equivalent in cash. 
   Recent experience with MMS's royalty-in-kind pilot program has shown that the government can increase the value of its royalty oil and gas by consolidation and bulk sales. 
   Under royalty-in-kind, the government controls and markets its oil without relying on its lessees to act as its agent. This eliminates a number of issues that have resulted in litigation in recent years and allows the government to focus more directly on adding value to its oil and gas. 
   Finally, the FERC relicensing study requires FERC to immediately undertake a review of policies, procedures, and regulations for the licensing of hydroelectric projects to determine how to reduce the cost and time of obtaining a license. 
   I remind colleagues that this is a bipartisan piece of legislation that has been developed between Senator BINGAMAN and myself on the Energy Committee. It has been cleared, as I understand it, by our side unanimously. It is my understanding that there still remains objection on the other side, although we have had assurances that we are willing to work and try to address the concerns of those on the other side who have chosen to place a hold on this legislation. 
   In view of the heightened emotions associated with our energy crisis in this country, this is very responsible legislation that is needed and is supported by the administration. It is timely, and it is certainly overdue in view of the fact that we are down to the last few days of this session. I hope we can come to grips with meeting the obligation we have to pass the Energy Policy and Conservation Act out of this body. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Senator BINGAMAN and I have worked in a bipartisan manner on this legislation. I am sure Senator BINGAMAN would want to express his views. I encourage him to 
   avail himself of that opportunity. It is my understanding that the administration supports the triggering mechanism in our bill as opposed to the one in the House bill specifically, and, as a consequence, we have worked toward an effort to try to reach an accord. 
   We are certainly under the impression on this side that we worked this out satisfactorily to the administration. But objections may be raised. Senators are entitled to make objections, but I hope they are directed at issues that clearly address environmental improvements. 
   I have nothing more to say other than this legislation is needed. We have a crisis in energy, and we had best get on with it. Otherwise, I think the problem is going to suffer the exposures, particularly since we won't have authorization. 
   I thank the Senator. 
   I see the Senator from California, who may be able to shed some light on this.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to congratulate an exceptional elementary school principal, Mr. Karl Schleich of Wasilla, Alaska. He is the 2000 recipient of the National Distinguished Principals Award for Alaska. 
   The National Distinguished Principals Program (NDP) was established in 1984 as an annual event to honor elementary and middle school principals who set the pace, character, and quality of the education children receive during their early school years. The program is jointly sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education and the National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP). It calls attention to the fundamental importance of the school principal in achieving educational excellence for pre-kindergarten through eighth grade students. 
   Mr. Schleich's reputation for getting things done was established in southeast Alaska when, in his first position as an educational leader, he oversaw the creation of a grade 6-8 middle school in a former grade 7-12 building and then founded a regional association to support others making similar transitions. As an assistant principal, he helped model a middle school program that received statewide and national attention. In his role as principal at Snowshoe Elementary School, he has boosted school improvement efforts, developed and trained staff in schoolwide assessments of writing, reading comprehension, and early literacy skills, as well as portfolios of children's work. Karl Schleich is commended by his colleagues for his uncommon interpersonal skills and energy that he has demonstrated in his 12 years as a principal. 
   Our Nation's future depends on today's educators. Currently, 40 percent of America's 4th graders read below the basic level on national reading tests. On international tests, the nation's 12th graders rank last in Advanced Physics compared with students in 18 other countries. And one-third of all incoming college freshmen must enroll in a remedial reading, writing, or mathematics class before taking regular courses. This country is in need of more devoted and talented educators. I commend Mr. Schleich for his hard work and dedication to our children. He is educating those who will lead this country in creating, developing, and putting to work new ideas and technology.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Heritage Land Transfer Act of 2000. This legislation, while inconsequential when compared to many of the issues we deal with in the U.S. Congress, is extremely important to two of my oldest constituents, Douglas and Daniel Gross. These two brothers along with the other members of the Gross family are amongst Alaska's earliest pioneers. These two brothers have spent over 80 years drawing their existence out of the harsh Southeastern Alaskan environment. Through all these years, they managed to raise their families and contributed to building the great State that I have the privilege of representing. I would also point out that Douglas and Daniel Gross served our Nation during World War II at its time of greatest need--now these two veterans need our help to right a wrong that has been vested upon them through no fault of their own. 
   ``The Heritage Land Transfer Act of 2000'' directs the Forest Service to convey 160 acres to Daniel and Douglas Gross. This granting of clear title would fix a problem that has plagued the family for the past 20 years. The need for this action arises from the fact that no records remain to substantial the family's claim that they homesteaded on Greens Point in the 1930's. Family homesteading records were destroyed when the Gross home burned to the ground in 1935-1936 and to make matters worse, the Forest Service is unable to locate any documentation to substantiate the Gross family claim. With neither title nor documentation, Doug and Dan Gross are unable to produce any legal record of ownership to the land their parents homesteaded. The paper records, however, are the only things missing. The Forest Service willingly acknowledges that a large body of evidence exists that clearly establishes the fact that the family built a home on Greens Point in the 1930's, that they grew and sold vegetables from this farmstead, and that they were good neighbors to many people caught out in our famous Alaskan storms. While the family and the Forest Service have searched in vain for written records, there is one piece of physical evidence to substantiate the family claim. On September 11, 1989, Alaska State Senator Robin Taylor traveled to the Gross property on the Stikine River for the purpose of locating a witness tree which would provide objective proof to the Gross family claim of homestead. In a letter Senator Taylor sent to Richard Kohrt, Wrangell District Ranger, Tongass National Forest he wrote ``I was present when Mr. Bungy, United States Forest Service specialist, sawed and chopped open the large spruce tree which the Gross Brothers had identified from memory as being a witness tree. Mr. Bungy verified that the large blaze uncovered was of the exact age that coincided with the Gross claim. By counting the annual growth rings it coincided with the many affidavits and statements of witness about the Gross claim of homestead.'' 
   There is no question that the family settled on the Green Point property on the Stikine River in the 1930's. They raised all of their children on their property and were good friends to all who lived and worked throughout the region. I have in my possession many affidavits, each one testifying to the settlement of the Gross family along the Stikine River. I offer the following quotations typical of these testaments: ``In the early 1930's I spent a lot of time up the Stikine River at the Gross Ranch. They had a large two story home and a huge garden .....'' ``I stayed with Mr. and Mrs. Bill Gross in the middle thirties. Bessie Gross took care of my brother Gilbert and I while my mother and father were out fishing, they had a house and garden on the river which everyone knows as the Gross place even to this day .....'' ``I stayed with Bessie Gross and Family during the late 1930's in their place up the river .....'' And another from Mr. Harry Sundberg, a gillnet fisherman, used to fish in ``what was known locally as the Gross homestead.'' Mr. Sundberg goes on to say ``While most people during that period did not file on the land they occupied, I distinctly recall that our conversations included the fact that they had applied for their application to own property similar to Captain Lee, who owned the property directly south of them on the mainland.'' 
   The Homestead Act requires residency for a minimum of 3 years. These affidavits, and many others, verify the Gross families life on this property since the early 1930's. In a letter from the Department of Agriculture to Senator STEVENS they write ``Even though it's clear the Gross family homesteaded on the property, there is no evidence or record that they completed the process to obtain title.'' Another letter from the Department of Agriculture states ``the Forest Service does not and has not refuted your claim that you and/or your family resided at Greens Point in the 1930's.'' An Alaska Magazine article written in 1984 references the ``Gross place'' along the Stikine River. 
   The Homestead Act authorized the transfer of 160 acre parcels of federal land to private owners. The Gross Homestead is 160.8 acres. A tree, both Daniel and Douglas Gross remember being used as a survey marker when they were boys, was examined in 1989 and found to have a flat face blazed into the wood approximately 50 years  prior. This is not a coincidence. It is proof this land was surveyed when the family claims it was surveyed. 
   This family has lived on, and made use of this land for 70 years. It is time for them to be named the legal title holders, and to complete the already started process of shuffling paper.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have had a series of discussions with my colleagues on the energy crisis in this country. 
   I think it is fair to make a broad statement relative to the crisis. The crisis is real. We have seen it in our gasoline prices. We saw it last week when oil hit an all-time high of $37 a barrel--the highest in 10 years. And now we are busy blaming each other for the crisis. 
   I think it is fair to say that our friends across the aisle have taken credit for the economy because it occurred during the last 7 years. I also think it is fair that our colleagues take credit for the energy crisis that has occurred because they have been here for the last 7 years. 
   I have talked about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, what I consider the insignificance of the drawdown, and the signal that it sends to OPEC that, indeed, we are vulnerable at 58-percent dependence on imported oil. That sends a message that we are willing to go into our savings account. 
   What did we get out of that? We got about a 3- to 4-day supply of heating oil. That is all. We use about a million barrels of heating oil a day during the winter. That has to be taken out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in crude form--30 million barrels--and transferred to the refineries which are already operating at capacity because we haven't had any new refineries built in this country in the last 15 to 20 years. 
   This is not the answer. 
   I am going to talk a little bit about one of the answers that should be considered by this body and has been considered before. In fact, in 1995, the issue of opening up that small area of the Coastal Plain, known as ANWR, came before this body. We supported it. The President vetoed it. If we had taken the action to override that veto of the President, or if the President had supported us, we would know what is in this small area of the Coastal Plain. When I say ``small area,'' I implore my colleagues to reflect on the realities. 
   Here is Alaska--one-fifth the size of the United States. If you overlay Alaska on the map of the United States, it runs from Canada to Mexico, and Florida to California. The Aleutian Islands go thousands of miles further. There is a very small area near the Canadian border. When I say ``small,'' I mean small in relationship to Alaska with 365 million acres. 
   But here we have ANWR in a little different proportion. This is where I would implore Members to understand realities. This is 19 million acres. This is the size of the State of South Carolina. 
   A few of the experts around here have never been there and are never going to go there in spite of our efforts to get them to go up and take a look. 
   Congress took responsible action. In this area, they created a refuge of 9 million acres in permanent status. They made another withdrawal--only they put it in a wilderness in permanent status with 78.5 million acres, leaving what three called the 1002 area, which is 1 1/2 million acres. 
   That is this Coastal Plain. That is what we are talking about. 
   This general area up here--Kaktovik--is a little Eskimo village in the middle of ANWR. 
   They say this is the ``Serengeti.'' There is a village in it. There are radar sites in it. To suggest it has never been touched is misleading. 
   Think for a moment. Much has been made of the crude oil prices dropping $2 a barrel when the President tapped the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and released 30 million barrels of oil. 
   While I believe the price drop will only be temporary, I ask 
   my fellow Senators what the price of crude oil would be today if the President had not vetoed opening up ANWR 6 years ago. It would have been at least $10 less because we would have had another million-barrel-a-day supply on hand. 
   What would prices be if OPEC and the world knew that potentially 1 to 2 million barrels a day of new oil was coming out of the ANWR Coastal Plain, and not only for 3 or 4 or 15 days, but for decades?  
   Let me try to belie the myth of what is in ANWR in relationship to Prudhoe Bay. This area of Prudhoe Bay has been supplying this Nation with nearly 25 percent of its crude oil for almost two decades--2 1/2 decades. 
   We built an 800-mile pipeline with the capacity of over 2 million barrels. Today, that pipeline is flowing at 1 million barrels with the decline of Prudhoe Bay. 
   You might not like oil fields but Prudhoe Bay is the finest oil field in the world, bar none. I defy anybody to go up there and compare it with other oil fields. The environmental sensitivity is unique because we have to live by rules and regulations. 
   The point I want to make is when Prudhoe Bay was developed and this pipeline was built at a cost of roughly $6.5 billion to nearly $7 billion, the estimate of what we would get out of the oil field was 9 billion barrels. 
   Here we are 23 or 24 years later, and we have gotten over 12 billion barrels. It is still pumping at better than 1 million barrels a day. 
   The estimates up here range from a low of 5.7 billion to a high of 16 billion barrels--16 billion barrels. What does that equate to? It is kind of in the eye of the beholder. Some say it would be a 200-day supply--a 200-day supply of America's oil needs. They are basing their estimates on old data of 3.2 billion barrels in ANWR, ignoring the most recent estimates by the U.S. Geological Survey that there is a 5 percent chance of 16 billion barrels--that is at the high end with a mean estimate of 10.3 billion barrels. That is the average. For the sake of conversation, we might as well say a 10.3 billion barrel average. 
   Under this argument, Prudhoe Bay, the largest oil field in the United States, has only a 600-day supply. That is assuming all oil stops flowing from all other places, and we have no other source of oil other than Alaska. So those arguments don't hold water. 
   But the Wilderness Society and the Sierra Club say it is only a 200-day supply. It is only this, or it is only that; and using that logic, the SPR is only a 15-day supply, in theory. 
   Let's make sure we keep this discussion where it belongs. 
   To give you some idea, in this 1002 area, in comparison to an eastern seaboard State, let's take the State of Vermont, and say that there are absolutely no other sources for oil in the entire Coastal Plain. If this 1002 area was designated to fulfill Vermont's needs, that 200-day supply is enough to heat homes and run equipment all over Vermont for the next 197 years. So don't tell me that is insignificant. For New Hampshire, for example, it would be 107 years.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, here are the Iraqi oil exports into the United States. They have gone up. Let me show some more charts because pictures are worth a thousand words. People say we have to concern ourselves with the issue of the porcupine caribou herd. This is ANWR, Canada. This is the Demster Highway. These are oil wells drilled in Canada. These in the light color were drilled. They didn't find any oil, but this is the route of the caribou. They have gone through this area. They cross the Demster Highway with no problem at all. The caribou calve--where do they calve? Sometimes they calve in ANWR, sometimes they do not. We are not going to have any oil development in the summertime in the calving area. 
   This is what it is like over in Iraq. This is what it was like during the Persian Gulf war. There we are trying to clean up the mess caused by Saddam Hussein. That is the guy we are helping to support today, now with biological capabilities. 
   There are a couple of more points I wish to make. Talk about compatibility, here is something I think is fairly compatible. This shows a couple of guys out for a walk--3 bears. Why are they walking on the pipeline? The pipeline is warm. This is in the Prudhoe Bay oil field. Nobody is shooting those guys. They are happy. They walk over. 
   I can remember 15 years ago when they said: You build that pipeline and you are going to cut the State in half. The caribou, the moose will never go over from the other side. It just did not happen. It will not happen because these guys are compatible with the environment, as long as you don't harm them, chase them, run them down and so forth. 
   We have a lot of things going here, given the opportunity. If these Members would go back, if you will, to your environmental critics and say: What do you suggest? Can American technology overcome, if you will, our environmental obligation? Can we open up this area safely? Do we have the science and technology? There is nothing to suggest that we do not have that capability. 
   This is where we are getting our oil from now, with no environmental conscience about how they are getting it out of the ground. That is irresponsible on their part. 
   I am going to leave you with one thought. Here are the people with whom I am concerned. Those are the people who live in my State. This is in a small village. These are the kids walking down the street. It is snowing, it is cold, it is tough. It is a tough environment. 
   One of my friends, Oliver Leavitt, spoke about life in Barrow. That is at the top of the world, right up here. You can't go any further north or you fall off the top. He said I could come to the DIA school to keep warm because the first thing I did every morning was go out on the beach and pick up the driftwood. Of course, there are no trees. The driftwood has to come down the river.  
   Jacob Adams said:  
   I love life in the Arctic but it's harsh, expensive, and for many, short. My people want decent homes, electricity and education. We do not want to be undisturbed. Undisturbed means abandoned. It means sod huts and deprivation.  
   The native people of the Coastal Plain are asking for the same right of the Audubon Society of Louisiana, the same right this administration itself is supporting in the Russian Arctic Circle, and the same right the Gwich'ins had in 1984 when they offered to lease their lands. 
   The oil companies should have bought it. There just wasn't any oil there. 
   I recognize the public policy debate about this issue is complex and will involve issues at the heart of the extreme environmental agenda which is driving our energy policy. It certainly is not relieving it. 
   At the same time, I think the issue can be framed simply as: Is it better to give the Inupiat people, the people of the Arctic, this right? 
   These people live up here. This is an Eskimo village. There is the village. Do you want to give them the right, while promoting a strong domestic energy policy that safeguards our environment and our national security, rather than rely on the likes of Saddam Hussein to supply the energy? 
   The answer in my mind is clear, as well as in the minds of the Alaskans.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, right now, all across America, Medicare beneficiaries are seeking medical care from a flawed health care system. Reduced benefit packages, ever escalating costs, and limited access in rural areas are just a few of the problems our system faces on a daily basis. For this reason, Congress must continue to move towards the modernization of Medicare. But as we address the needs of beneficiaries, we must not turn our back upon the very providers that seniors rely upon for their care. 
   These providers are the physicians, the therapists, the nurses, and the allied health professionals who deliver quality care to our needy Medicare population. They are the backbone of our complex health care network. When our nation's seniors need care, it is the provider who heals, not the health insurer--and certainly not the federal government. 
   But more, and more often, seniors are being told by providers that they don't accept Medicare. This is becoming even more common in rural areas, where the number of physicians and access to quality care is already severely limited. Quite simply, beneficiaries are being told that their insurance is simply not wanted. Why? Well it's not as simple as low reimbursement rates. In fact it's much more complex. 
   The infrastructure that manages the Medicare program, the Health Care Financing Administration and its network of contractors, have built up a system designed to block care and micro-manage independent practices. Providers simply can't afford to keep up with the seemingly endless number of complex, redundant, and unnecessary regulations. And if providers do participate? Well, a simple administrative error in submitting a claim could subject them to heavy-handed audits and the financial devastation of their practice. Should we force providers to choose between protecting their practice and caring for seniors? 
   I believe the answer is no. For this reason, I am introducing the ``Medicare Billing and Education Act of 2000.'' Co-sponsored by Senator ABRAHAM, this legislation will restore fairness to the Medicare system. It will allow providers to practice medicine without fearing the threats, 
   intimidation, and aggressive tactics of a faceless bureaucratic machine. 
   Most importantly, this bill will reform the flawed appeals process within HCFA. Currently, a provider charged with receiving an overpayment is forced to choose between three options: admit the overpayment, submit additional information to mitigate the charge, or appeal the decision. However, a provider who chooses to submit additional evidence must subject their entire practice to review and waive their appeal rights. That's right--to submit additional evidence you must waive your right to an appeal! 
   And what is the result of this maddening system that runs contrary to our nation's history of fair and just administrative decisions? Often, providers are intimidated into accepting the arbitrary decision of an auditor employed by a HCFA contractor. Sometimes, they are even forced to pull out of the Medicare program. In the end, our senior population suffers. 
   Under my bill, providers will be allowed to retain their appeal rights should they choose to first submit additional evidence to mitigate the charge. Many providers receive an overpayment as the result of a simple administrative mistake. For cases not involving fraud, a provider will be able  to return that overpayment within twelve months without fear of prosecution. This is a common sense approach, and will not lead to any additional costs to the Medicare system. 
   To bring additional fairness to the system, my bill will prohibit the retroactive application of regulations, and allow providers to challenge the constitutionality of HCFA regulations. Further, it will prohibit the crippling recovery of overpayments during an appeal, and bar the unfair method of withholding valid future payments to recover past overpayments. These common sense measures maintain the financial viability of medical practices during the resolution of payment controversies, and restore fundamental fairness to the dispute resolution procedures existing within HCFA. 
   Like many of our nation's problems, the key to improvement is found in education. For this reason, I have included language that stipulates that at least ten percent of the Medicare Integrity Program funds, and two percent of carrier funds, must be devoted to provider education programs. 
   providers cannot be expected to comply with the endless number of Medicare regulations if they are not shown how to submit clean claims. We must ensure that providers are given the information needed to eliminate future billing errors, and improve the responsiveness of HCFA. 
   It is with the goal of protecting our Medicare population, and the providers who tend care, that leads me to introduce the ``Medicare Billing and Education act of 2000.'' This bill will ensure that providers are treated with the respect that they deserve, and that Medicare beneficiaries aren't told that their health insurance isn't wanted. We owe it to our nation's seniors. I urge immediate action on this worthy bill.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is my intention this morning to talk about natural gas and alert the American people to the crisis we have before us relative to this very important source of clean energy. 
   Over the last several days, I have talked about our energy policy, the fact that, to a large degree, our energy policy is determined by environmental groups, environmental pressures, and the Environmental Protection Agency, as opposed to a balance which suggests, indeed, we need to face the realization that we need all our energy sources coming together to meet the crisis we have today, as we find ourselves 58-percent dependent on imported oil. 
   I will also speak on the dangers of Iraq and the realization that we are now 750,000-barrels-a-day dependent on Iraqi oil. The interesting thing is that Iraq has a production of nearly 2.5 million barrels a day, a kind of leverage on the world's supply of oil. What I mean is that the capacity of the world to produce oil and the demand of the world to use that oil is very close. We are somewhere in the area of roughly 1 million barrels a day of excess capacity over demand. With Iraq producing better than 2 million barrels a day, one can clearly see the leverage Iraq has should they choose to reduce production. 
   I have also talked about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the merits of pulling down 30 million barrels, which sounds like a significant relief, if indeed we can turn that into heating oil, but the reality is that we are going to get 3 to 4 million barrels out of that 30 million barrels in heating oil which amounts to a 2- or 3-day supply. 
   I do not want to mislead anybody. It is simply my attempt to alert the  American people; there is no panacea. We are going to need all our sources of oil. To blame big oil on profiteering is really shortsighted, and the American people are too smart to believe some of the rhetoric out there. 
   Just look at where we were a year ago with the price of oil at $10 a barrel. Were the oil companies so benevolent then or was it supply and demand? Of course. 
   Who sets the price of oil? We had a hearing yesterday. Secretary Richardson was there. I think we all agreed that the price of oil, without question, is being set by those who supply oil, who have an abundance of oil, and that is primarily OPEC, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and Mexico. They have it for sale, and the price currently is somewhere in the area of $33 to $34. Last week, we had an all-time high in over 10 years of about $37.86. 
   Tomorrow I am going to talk about ANWR. I know something about ANWR. That is the narrow area in the coastal plain of Alaska. It is that small area that has been set aside out of the whole area of ANWR. Few people really understand the merits and the magnitude of the land mass and what we have done with it by congressional action. 
   There are 19 million acres up there. That is about the size of the State of South Carolina. We have taken 8.5 million acres and put them in a permanent wilderness. We have taken another 9 million acres and put them in a refuge, leaving 1.5 million acres of the so-called 1002 area to the determination of Congress as to whether or not we can open it up safely. 
   Industry says, if the oil is there in the abundance it would have to be, the footprint would be about 2,000 acres. So I think we ought to keep this discussion in perspective. 
   I am pleased to say, one of the Presidential candidates supports opening it, recognizing that we have the technology, we can do it correctly, we can make the footprint small. If the oil is there, we could very well produce another million barrels a day. We have the pipeline capacity. One can certainly imagine what kind of message that would send to OPEC. You would see the price of oil drop dramatically. Also, as we look at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, it certainly makes sense to know whether we have one sitting up in the arctic area adjacent to Prudhoe Bay. 
   Today, I am going to talk about the natural gas crisis in America because that crisis is here today. To give you some idea, yesterday we were quoting gas prices for delivery in October at $5.34 per 1,000 cubic feet. How does that compare with 9 months ago? Nine months ago, it was $2.16 per thousand cubic feet. What is it for November of this year? The November figures are out. It is $5.45 for delivery in November. 
   The significance of that can probably be reflected on who uses gas. The American public out there knows who uses gas. Fifty percent of our homes in this country rely on natural gas for heating. Natural gas provides 15 percent of our Nation's electrical power, and it is growing. 
   The reality is, we are not going to have any new supply in place before this winter. The reality is, the administration isn't going to be able to go into a strategic natural gas reserve, because there isn't any. 
   So what are we going to do? The projections are very clear. We are using about 22 trillion cubic feet of gas now. It is estimated we will be somewhere between 32 and 34 trillion cubic feet by the year 2010. 
   This is going to be primarily the result of the utility industry in this country--an industry we take for granted because the lights usually work. We are an electronic society. We depend on computers, e-mail. This power has to come from somewhere. You have your air-conditioners, your heating. The demand is up. 
   It is going to cost the industry somewhere in the area of $1.5 billion to put in more infrastructure. We are concerned about pipeline safety. As more gas is utilized, we are putting more pressure on our pipelines. This is a multiplier of demand, of price increases. The reason so much pressure is on natural gas is we do not have a policy on oil. Our policy is to import more oil. Before the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo, after which we created SPR, we were 37-percent dependent on imported oil. To give you some idea of where we are going in that regard, today we are 58-percent dependent on imported oil. 
   The administration has always favored clean gas as the alternative. But now we are using our gas reserves faster than we are finding new reserves. When you are in business, and you are selling your inventory faster than you are replacing it, you have a problem. This is an alert to the American people and, hopefully, my colleagues because we are facing a train wreck. It is coming. The signs are here. The administration has yet to address what they are going to do about it. 
   Certainly releasing the crude oil in SPR isn't going to help the gas situation because the demand is there. The reason the demand is there is quite simple. I have indicated oil is not the answer, simply because we become more dependent on imports. 
   So let's move to hydro. What do they want to do? They want to take down hydroelectric dams. The tradeoff of that, of course, is putting the barge traffic on the highways. 
   Coal: We have an abundance of coal. We have clean coal technology. But you have not seen a new coal plant built in this country in the last several years. I think the last one was back in the mid-1990s. You can't get permits. 
   Nuclear: Twenty percent of our power comes from nuclear energy. Have we built a new plant in this last decade or the last two decades? No one in their right mind would build a nuclear plant because the Government will not fulfill its contractual commitments to take the waste that it agreed to do and the ratepayers have been paying for the last two decades. 
   So everywhere we look--everywhere we look--we are check-mated. We can't find an alternative source other than gas. That is why American consumers should care. 
   According to the Energy Information Administration, Midwestern families will spend as much as 40 percent more on heating this winter because of higher natural gas prices; that is, expecting a typical winter. A real cold spike could cause some real problems. I am not suggesting you go out and sharpen your saw or put gasoline in your chain saw, but it isn't a bad idea. I know that is being done in the Northeast Corridor. 
   So we have an increased demand, no new supply, and this adds up to higher gas prices for the American people this winter, make no mistake about it. 
   What has the administration done about it? As I have said, it used to be that natural gas was kind of a seasonal fuel, stored underground in the summer, drawn down for winter use. But we now have a large summer demand for natural gas because more and more electric powerplants rely on natural gas. Here is the figure: Over 96 percent of all the new plants will be gas fired. If they all come on line, we simply do not have the gas supply. 
   Again, permits are obtainable for gas, unlike coal and fossil fuel. We can't get enough natural gas from existing wells to fuel these new powerplants if they all go on line. I had one CEO of a major oil and gas company tell me: We are virtually out of natural gas. We can no longer store gas in the summer. Our winter stocks are low. With a cold winter, prices are going to go up. Reserves are not adequate to buffer surges in consumer demand. 
   As I have stated, even if this winter is normal, we will still face natural gas prices--we know it already--they are going to be over 50 percent higher than last year--$2.16--and I indicated earlier they are currently $5.45 for November delivery. The simple reason is, the demand is strong and supply is not keeping pace. The market responds with what? Higher prices. It is supply and demand. 
   The administration touts natural gas as its ``bridge to the energy future'': Our cleanest fossil fuel, fewer emissions; efficient end use; no need to depend on imports. Yet as they express this and encourage you to use gas, their actions simply do not match the rhetoric. Rather than encourage new supplies, they stifle supplies. 
   Proof: This administration has placed Federal lands off limits to new natural gas exploration and production. They have taken the Rocky Mountain overthrust belt--that is Wyoming, Colorado, Montana--these States have a tremendous capability for producing oil and gas. Well more  than 50 percent--about 56 percent--of the public land in those areas, the overthrust belt, have been taken off from any exploration or development for oil and gas. 
   Now the Forest Service comes along with a roadless policy to lock up 40 million acres of national forest, eliminating any exploration for oil and gas. We have a moratorium on OCS leasing and drilling until 2012. 
   The Vice President would even cancel existing leases. He made a statement in Rye, NH, on October 21, 1999:  
   I will make sure that there is no new oil leasing off the coasts of California and Florida. And then I will go much further: I will do everything in my power to make sure that there is no new drilling off these sensitive areas--even in areas already leased by previous administrations.  
   I do not know what that means to you, Mr. President, but it means to me that he is not going to support OCS activities of any consequence, and he is even going to attempt to cancel and negate some of the existing leases. 
   Where is it going to come from? He conveniently ducks that issue. AL GORE claims to have invented the Internet, but he refuses to provide natural gas that is needed to provide electricity to power it. 
   We use more electricity today. We are an energy consuming country--e-mails, electronics, computers. Even if we had access to more natural gas, regulation after regulation inhibits construction of new pipelines to get gas to the consumer. 
   The Northeast Corridor: There have been nothing but delays--3 years of delay. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, that regulates and has to approve it, has been sitting on it. This would have given the Northeast Corridor a clean source of fuel. Most of this is Canadian gas. It has taken forever. 
   This administration wants you to use more natural gas, but at the same time they make sure you can't get it. That sounds like a recipe for higher prices, if you ask me, higher home electric costs, heating costs. Then what happens to the problem? It is going to get worse. The demand is expected to grow from 22 trillion cubic feet to over 35 trillion cubic feet by the year 2010. Without new exploration and new production, natural gas prices are going to go even higher. We are going to pay more to heat our homes, run our businesses. 
   When higher heating bills arrive this winter, we will want to thank the President and Vice President GORE for causing a natural gas crisis in America, one that was predictable, one that we knew was coming. 
   We have been asleep. The train wreck is coming. The solution is obvious: increase domestic supply of gas. Increased domestic supply will obviously lower prices, reduce volatility, and ensure a safe and secure energy supply. 
   I am all for alternative energy. I am all for conservation. But the reality is, transportation does not move on hot air. Members of this body don't go home on an airplane that flies on hot air. It flies on fuel. Our homes are not heated by hot air from Washington. They are heated by natural gas, 50 percent of all homes. That is 56 million homes in this country. 
   We found 36 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in the Prudhoe Bay oil field while searching for oil. We never looked for gas. Now there is a possibility the economics will favor bringing that gas down from Alaska for distribution in the lower 48 States, but don't think it is going to be cheap gas. You have to amortize the cost of a pipeline that is going to run some 1,600 miles down through Alaska, follow the Alcan Highway, going through Canada and into the Canadian prebuilt system for distribution into the U.S. 
   The fact is, we have proven gas, but the market has never been able to sustain the cost. At this range, the feasibility of that project is very costly. The most important thing we can do, however, is to increase access to proven natural gas that is likely to be found on Federal lands. We need to depend on all sources of energy--oil, gas, clean coal, hydro, and nuclear--and we need to conserve. 
   That is why Senator LOTT and others have introduced the National Energy Security Act of 2000, S. 2557. Briefly, it would increase the domestic gas supply by allowing frontier royalty relief; improving Federal gas lease management; providing tax incentives for production; and assuring price certainty for small producers. It would require the administration to develop a comprehensive strategy to ensure that natural gas remains affordable and available to American consumers. It would allow new exploration for natural gas in America's Arctic as well as the Rocky Mountain States and along the OCS areas. 
   As I have indicated, we have substantial potential for new reserves, but if you don't have access to the areas, you might as well leave it in the ground because it will never be developed. We want to remove the disincentives for utilities to use natural gas, protect consumers against seasonal price spikes, especially with regard to Northeast heating oil use, and increase funding for energy efficiency and weatherization assistance to reduce winter heating bills. 
   A noted economist, Daniel Yergin, stated that this current energy ``shock'' could turn into a world crisis--that is paraphrasing the exposure that we have today. You can ask Tony Blair from Great Britain about the price of energy that is threatening his Government. Unless we take the kinds of actions outlined in this policy plan of the Republicans that we have submitted before this body, as represented in the legislation, S. 2557, the National Energy Security Act, we very well will face a current energy shock that could turn into a world crisis. Just look at the stock market this morning; it is pretty shaky. 
   There is probably more to come because of the uncertainty over where we are with regard to energy and the spiraling costs. It is referenced in a taxi ride to Capitol Hill; there is a surcharge. It is referenced in your airplane ticket now. You can't figure out the airplane tickets anyway; they are so confusing whether you fly on Thursday, Friday, or Sunday, or before a.m. or p.m. It is in there, all your truckers, all your delivery systems. Everybody is now facing the reality that energy costs are higher. It is going to have an effect. 
   Finally, thanks to the failed energy policies of Clinton-Gore, we are going to pay more for gas this winter. We must increase domestic supply of natural gas to meet demand. This administration continues to make new exploration and production not just difficult but almost impossible. We pay the price. 
   This GOP energy plan encourages short-term efforts to minimize spike hikes this winter and increase supply in the long term. 
   Tomorrow, I hope to talk a little bit about where the oil and gas is likely to be found.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to address the Energy bill which has been introduced by Senator LOTT. We have had a good deal of discussion about this country's continuing dependence on imported petroleum products, particularly crude oil, to the point that currently we are about 58-percent dependent. 
   As a consequence of the concern over the lack of adequate heating oil supplies, particularly in the eastern seaboard, the President, on the recommendation of the Vice President, made a determination to release about 30 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That is a significant event. 
   I question the legality of that action. I question the meaning or significance of that action, but we can get into that a little later in my comments. I am also going to touch on our realization of the high price of natural gas, following our recognition of our dependence on imported oil. 
   Oftentimes, we do not see ourselves as others see us. I am going to read a paragraph from the New York Times article of September 26 called ``Candidate In The Balance.'' It is by Thomas L. Friedman. 
   I quote:  
   Tokyo. It's interesting watching the American oil crisis/debate from here in Tokyo. The Japanese are cool as cucumbers today--no oil protests, no gas lines, no politicians making crazy promises. That's because Japan has been preparing for this day since the 1973 oil crisis by steadily introducing natural gas, nuclear power, high-speed mass transit and conservation, and thereby steadily reducing its dependence on foreign oil. And unlike the U.S., the Japanese never wavered from that goal by falling off the wagon and becoming addicted to S.U.V.'s--those they just make for the Americans.  
   I think there is a lot of truth to that. As we reflect on where we are today, I think we have had an acknowledgement at certain levels within the administration that they have been ``asleep at the wheel'' relative to our increasing dependence on imported oil. 
   This did not occur overnight. This has been coming on for some time. We can cite specifics over the last 7 or 8 years, and in every section, U.S. demand is outpacing U.S. supply. 
   We saw crude oil prices last week at a 10-year high--$37 a barrel--twice what they were at this time last year. 
   It is rather interesting to note the Vice President's comments the other day that the high price of oil was due to profiteering by big oil. That is certainly a convenient political twist, isn't it--profiteering by big oil. There was no mention that last year big oil was very generously making crude oil available at $10 a barrel. You think they did that out of generosity? Who sets the price of oil? Does Exxon? British Petroleum? Phillips? 
   Big oil isn't the culprit; it is our dependence on the supplier. Who is the supplier? The supplier is OPEC, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Mexico. They have it for sale. We are 58-percent dependent, so they set the price. 
   With crude oil at a 10-year high, gasoline prices are once again above $1.57, $1.59, in some areas $2 a gallon. 
   Natural gas--here is the culprit, here is what is coming, here is the train wreck--$5.25 to $5.30 for deliveries in the Midwest next month. What was it 9 months ago? It was $2.16. Think of that difference. 
   Utilities inventories are 15-percent below last winter's level. How many homes in America are dependent on natural gas for heating? The answer is 50 percent, a little over 50 percent; that is, 56 million homes are dependent on natural gas in this country. How many on fuel oil? Roughly 11 million. 
   What about our electric power generation? Fifteen percent of it currently comes from natural gas. What is the increasing demand for natural gas? We  are consuming 22 trillion cubic feet now. The projections are better than 30 trillion cubic feet by the year 2010. 
   The administration conveniently touts natural gas as its clean fuel for the future, but it will not allow us to go into the areas where we can produce more. 
   I remind my colleagues, I remind the Secretary of Energy, and I remind the Vice President and the President, there is no Strategic Petroleum Reserve for natural gas. You can't go out and bail this one out, Mr. President. The administration has placed Federal lands off limits to new natural gas exploration and production. 
   More than 50 percent of the overthrust belt--the Rocky Mountain area, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado--has been put off limits for exploration. We have a Forest Service roadless policy locking up an additional 40 million acres; a moratorium on OCS drilling until the year 2012. The Vice President said he would even consider canceling existing leases. 
   You have a situation with increased demand and no new supply. What does this add up to? Higher energy prices for consumers this winter--a train wreck. This is going to happen. Yet the administration sits idly by and hopes the election can take place before the voters read their fuel bills. 
   So there we are. We now have situations in California, in San Diego, of electricity price spikes. We have possible brownouts. The reason is, there is no new generation. You can't get permits for coal-fired plants. 
   It takes so long to get new generation on line. 
   Heating and fuel oil inventories, as I have indicated, are at the lowest level in decades, leaving us unprepared for winter. It is a lack of overall energy policy. 
   As to nuclear energy, 20 percent of the total power generated in this country comes from it. We can't address what to do about the waste. This body stands one vote short of a veto override to proceed with the commitments that we made to take that waste from the industry, waste that the consumers have been paying for the Federal Government to take for the last two decades. 
   Consumers have paid about $11 billion into that fund. The Federal Government was supposed to take the waste in 1998. It is in breach of its contract. The court has ruled that the industry can recover, and they can bypass anything but the Court of Claims. That is how far that has gone. 
   Let's look at crude oil and SPR. 
   With crude oil prices on the rise again, the administration has had to go back to OPEC time and time again to ask for more foreign oil. The assumption is, if they ask for 800,000 barrels, we get 800,000 barrels. We get 17 percent of that. That is about 130,000 barrels. That is our portion. Everybody gets some of OPEC's increased production. 
   Foreign imports into this country in June were 58 percent. Compare that with 36 percent during the 1973 Arab oil embargo. Recall the gasoline lines around the block at that time. The public was outraged. They blamed everybody, including Government. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? 
   Ask Tony Blair from Great Britain how he feels about the protests in England and everywhere else in Europe. It is threatening some governments. 
   To ensure we have a supply to fall back on, in 1973, 1974, 1975, we created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve or SPR. That was our response to the Arab oil embargo. We have about 571 million barrels of storage in SPR. SPR was set up to respond to a severe supply interruption, not to manipulate consumer price for a political effect. 
   We can only draw down about 4.1 million barrels per day from SPR. Remember something a lot of Americans, a lot of people in the media, do not understand: The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is not full of heating oil or gasoline or kerosene. It is full of crude oil. The crude oil has to be transported to a refinery. Our refineries are running at 96 percent of capacity. 
   The Vice President wants to release 30 million barrels from SPR to ``lower prices'' for consumers. I question the legality of that at this time because a drawdown can only occur if the President has found that a severe energy supply interruption has occurred. The Secretary released oil without any such finding. His excuse is that this is not a drawdown; it is a swap or an exchange. 
   This is the largest release of oil from SPR in its 25-year history, larger than during the gulf war. 
   Secretary Richardson stated today that the 30 million barrels of crude released from SPR may produce 3 to 5 million barrels of new heating oil. The U.S. uses 1 million barrels of heating oil per day. 
   So the obvious increase is 3, 4, 5 days' supply. That is not very much, is it? The Secretary's action regarding SPR may have an impact on price but may not have a significant impact on the supply of heating oil. That is just the harsh reality. 
   What about others? Well, Secretary of the Treasury Summers has indicated it is bad policy. He felt so strongly, he wrote a letter to Alan Greenspan. We have a copy of the memorandum that went from Mr. Summers, Secretary of the Treasury, to Alan Greenspan. I will refer to it in a moment. 
   Releasing SPR now weakens our ability to respond later to real supply emergencies. That is obvious to everyone. But I do want to enter into the RECORD this letter, a memorandum of September 13 from Lawrence H. Summers, Secretary of the Treasury, to the President. The memorandum is entitled ``Strategic Petroleum Reserve.'' Page 2, top paragraph:  
   Using the SPR at this time would be seen as a radical departure from past practice and an attempt to manipulate prices. The SPR was created to respond to supply disruptions and has never been used simply to respond to high prices or a tight market.  
   I don't think there is any question about the intent of that statement. It is bad policy. Alan Greenspan has indicated an agreement, or at least that is the impression we get. 
   The action that I indicated was illegal is illegal because it requires a Presidential finding. It is contrary to the intent of the authority for the transfer. And besides, we have not reauthorized the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It is held up in this body by a Senator on the other side who is objecting to the reauthorization of EPCA, which contains the reauthorization for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Releasing SPR oil now, as I indicated, weakens our ability to respond later to real supply emergencies. 
   Where were we 7 years ago with regard to SPR? We had an 86-day day supply of crude oil in SPR. Today, we have a 50-day supply. The administration has previously sold almost 28 million barrels. They sold it at a loss of $420 million, the theory being you buy high and you sell low. I guess the taxpayers foot the bill by making it up with the increased activity. I don't know what their logic has been, but that is the history. 
   Earlier this year, the Vice President stated: Opening SPR would be a compromise on our national energy security. He made that statement. Obviously, he has seen fit to change his mind. Everybody can change their minds, but nevertheless I think it represents an inconsistency. What we need is a real solution, reducing our reliance on foreign oil by increasing domestic production and using alternative fuels, incentives, conservation, weatherization. I could talk more on that later. 
   Also, it is interesting to note that the Vice President indicated his familiarization with SPR, that he was instrumental in the setting up of it. As we have noted, he was not in the Senate under the Ford administration when it was established. That is kind of interesting because it suggests that he is happy to get aboard on the issue and, again, may have had a significant role, but it is pretty hard to find the record showing him having an active role. 
   Another point is our increased dependence on Saddam Hussein and the threat to our national security in the sense that we are now importing about 750,000 barrels of oil from Iraq a day. Just before this administration, 
   we carried out Desert Storm, in 1991-1992. We had 147 Americans killed, 460 wounded, 23 taken prisoner. We continued to enforce, and continue today to enforce, a no-fly zone; that is, an aerial blockade. We have had flown over 200,000 sorties since the end of Desert Storm. It is estimated to cost the American taxpayer about $50 million. Yet this administration appears to become more reliant on Iraqi oil. 
   What we have is a supply and demand issue. Domestic production has declined 17 percent; domestic demand has  gone up 14 percent. Iraq is the fastest growing source of U.S. foreign oil--as I said, 750,000 barrels a day, nearly 30 percent of all Iraq's exports. We have been unable to proceed with our U.N. inspections in Iraq. There is illegal oil trading underway with other Arab nations; we know about it. Profits go to development of weapons of mass destruction, training of the Republican Guard, developing missile delivery capabilities, biological capabilities. 
   This guy is up to no good; there is absolutely no question about it. The international community is critical of the sanctions towards Iraq. But consider this: Saddam Hussein is known to put Iraqi civilians in harm's way when we retaliate with aerial raids. Saddam has used chemical weapons against his own people in his own territory. He could have ended sanctions at any time--by turning over his weapons of mass destruction for inspection; that is all. Yet he rebuilds his capacity to produce more. He cares more about these weapons than he apparently cares about his own people. That he is able to dictate our energy future is a tragedy of great proportion. Still, the administration doesn't seem to get the pitch. Saddam gets more aggressive. His every speech ends with ``death to Israel.'' If there is any threat to Israel's security, it is Saddam Hussein. 
   He has a $14,000 bounty on each American plane shot down by his gunnery crews. He accuses Kuwait of stealing Iraqi oil--here we go again--the same activity before he invaded Kuwait in 1990. Saddam is willing to use oil to gain further concessions. The U.N. granted Kuwait $15 billion in gulf war compensation. Iraq has retaliated and said it will cut off exports. OPEC's spare capacity can't make up the difference. 
   He has the leverage. We really haven't focused in on that. The U.N. postpones compensation hearings until after U.S. elections for fear of the impact on the world market. He is dictating the terms and conditions. He says: You force me to pay Kuwait and I will reduce production. We can't stand that because that is the difference between roughly the world's capacity to produce oil and the world's demand for that oil. And Saddam Hussein holds that difference. 
   I ask unanimous consent to proceed for another 7 minutes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. 
   I will try this approach because I think it references our foreign policy. If I get this right, we send him our dollars, he sells us the oil, we put the oil in our airplanes and go bomb him. Have I got that right? We buy his oil, fill our planes, and go bomb him. What kind of a foreign policy is that? He has us over a barrel, and it is a barrel of oil. 
   Another issue that is conveniently forgotten is refinery supply. Supply of crude oil is not the only issue. Even if we had more, we don't currently have the capacity to refine it. That is what is wrong with releasing oil from SPR. We don't have the ability for our refineries to take more product currently. That is unfortunate, but it is a reality. 
   We had a hearing this morning. The industry said they are up to maximum capacity with refinery utilization at 96 percent. We haven't built a new refinery for nearly a quarter century. We have had 36 refineries closed in this country in the last 10 years. This is due to EPA regulations. 
   We have the issue of reformulated gas. We have nine different geographical reformulated gasolines in this country. The necessity of that is the dictate from EPA. I am not going to go into that, but fuels made for Oregon are not suitable for California; fuels made for Maryland can't be sold in Baltimore; Chicago fuels can't be sold in Detroit. We are making designer gasoline. The result: Refiners do not have the flexibility to move supplies around the country or respond to the shortages. 
   The administration's response? Well, it is pretty hard to identify. They are trying to duck responsibility, hoping this issue will go away before the election takes place and the voters get their winter fuel bills. They are trying to keep this ``train wreck'' from occurring on their watch. They blame ``big oil'' for profiteering. 
   Think this thing through. Big oil profiteering: Where was big oil when they gave it away at $10 a barrel last year? Who sets the price? Well, it is OPEC, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and Mexico, because they have the leverage; they have the supply. I think the American people are too smart to buy the issue of big oil profiteering. And the issue related to the industry is that during the time that we had $10 oil, we weren't drilling for any gas. We lost about 57,000 gas wells, and I think 136,000 oil wells were taken out of production. Many were small. 
   So if we look at the areas where we get our energy, it is pretty hard to assume that there is any support in the area of domestic production and exploration because there is a reluctance to open up public land. 
   We have seen 17 percent less production since Clinton-Gore took office. They oppose the use of plentiful American coal. EPA permits make it uneconomic. We haven't had a new coal-fired plant in this country in the last several years. They force the nuclear industry to choke on its own waste. Yet the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals now says the utilities with nuclear plants can sue the Federal Government because it won't store the waste. That could cost the taxpayer $40 billion to $80 billion. They threaten to tear down the hydroelectric dams and replace barge traffic on the river system by putting it on the highways. That is a tradeoff? They ignore electric reliability and supply concerns, price spikes in California, no new generation or transmission. They claim to support increased use of natural gas while restricting supply and preventing new exploration. 
   The Vice President indicated in a speech in Rye, NH, on October 21, 1999, he would oppose further offshore leasing and would even look to canceling some existing leases. Where are we headed? Downhill. It means higher natural gas prices, higher oil prices, higher gasoline and fuel oil prices, plus higher electricity prices. That equals, in my book, inflation. 
   We have been poking inflation in the ribs with higher energy prices, driving all consumer prices higher. One-third of our balance of payments is the cost of imported oil. We are a high-tech society. We use a lot of electricity for our activities--computer activities, e-mail, and everything else. All this boils down to the makings of a potential economic meltdown. 
   What we need is a national energy strategy which recognizes the need for a balanced approach to meeting our energy needs. We need all of the existing energy sources. We have the National Energy Security Act before us on this floor. We want to increase energy efficiency, maximize utilization of alternative fuels/renewables, and increase domestic oil supply and gas production. We want to reauthorize EPCA, reauthorize the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Our bill would increase our domestic energy supplies of coal, oil, and natural gas by allowing frontier royalty relief, improving Federal oil/gas lease management, providing tax incentives for production, and assuring price certainty for small producers. 
   We want to allow new exploration. Twenty percent of the oil has come from my State of Alaska in the last two decades. We can open up the Arctic Coastal Plain safely, and everybody knows it. The reason is that we want to promote new clean coal technology, protect consumers against seasonal price spikes, and foster increased energy efficiency. 
   Regardless of how you say it, American consumers really need to understand that this train wreck is occurring and it is occurring now. We have to develop a balanced and comprehensive energy strategy, one that takes economic and environmental factors into account at the same time, and one that provides the prospect of a cleaner, more secure energy in the future. 
   We have this energy strategy. We have it proposed. It is on the floor of this body. This administration does not. They are just hoping the train wreck doesn't happen on their watch. The consequences of over 7 years of failed Clinton-Gore energy policies are now being felt in the pocketbooks of working American families. Mr. President, we deserve better. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, yesterday I took the floor and discussed the problems associated with the price of oil and our increased dependence on imports from Iraq and the regime of Saddam Hussein. 
   Yesterday, I told this body that oil had peaked at its highest price in 10 years. I am here today to tell you that oil has peaked for the second time in 2 days with the highest point in 10 years--$37.86 a barrel. 
   There is a reaction occurring. It is rather interesting. I am going to discuss it briefly because my intention today was to talk about natural gas. 
   Natural gas, as many of us will remember, 9 months ago was about $2.16. Deliveries in October are in the area of $5.40, a 44-percent increase in a relatively short period of time. The administration is reacting. 
   The news today tells us that there is going to be a recommendation from the Vice President to open up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to set up a heating oil reserve. There are a couple of things that are pending. One is the reauthorization of SPR in the EPCA bill, which is currently being held by a Member on the other side of the aisle. The administration is asking us to release the authority by passing EPCA. We are going to have to take care of that little matter first. But let's talk a little bit about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve because it is probably the most misunderstood issue on the burner today. 
   SPR was created back in 1973 during the era of the Arab oil embargo at a time when this Nation was 35-percent dependent on imported oil. Today we are 56-percent--nearly 58-percent dependent on imported oil. We swore back in 1973 we would never be held hostage and would never have such exposure to the national energy security of this country. So we created the salt caverns in the gulf for storage. 
   The question of the conceptual purpose behind this was the Mideast cartel was holding us hostage and, by having a reserve, it would act as a protection if our supplies were cut off. Congress dictated that we have a 90-day supply of oil in the reserve to offset the amount of oil we might import should it be needed if the supply were to be disrupted from the Mideast. 
   It is kind of interesting to go back and look at the arithmetic. 
   When the Clinton administration came in, in 1992, we had an 86-day supply in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Today, we have a 50-day supply. What has the Clinton administration done with that difference? They sold some of the SPR to meet their budget requirements. I think this is a dangerous level--50 days. I think it is inadequate to respond to any severe disruption that might occur. 
   The Mideast has always been a hot spot with the possibility of a conflict at any time and cutting off supplies. We are seeing Saddam Hussein now threaten the U.N. as the U.N. attempts to hold Saddam Hussein financially responsible for damages associated with the Kuwaiti invasion. They are asking for compensation. But yesterday Saddam Hussein told the U.N. where to go. He said: No, I am not paying retribution. If you make me pay retribution, I will cut my supply and my production. Then what are you going to do? We know what the U.N. did. They backed off and said: We will take it up later. He is dictating the crucial supply of oil. 
   As the administration talks about the merits of opening up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, I think we have to reflect on what it was designed to do. It was to be used to give us the timeframe of ensuring that if the supply were cut off, we would have a buffer by having a supply on which we could call. 
   But make no mistake about it. The media completely misses this point. SPR does not contain refined product. It contains crude oil. You have to take it out of the reserve. You have to move it to a refinery and then refine it. Our refineries are virtually at full capacity now. If you take the oil out of SPR and take it to a refinery, you are going to offset other oil that that refinery would cut. As a consequence, how much more refined product have you put on the market? I think the administration owes us an explanation as they contemplate, if you will, taking oil out of SPR. 
   Mind you, the emergency we have is supply and demand. We are producing much less than we used to produce. Our demand is up 14 percent. Our product  has fallen 17 percent. We are in a supply and demand crunch. As a consequence of that, we have a third factor many people overlook, and that is, we haven't built a new refinery in this country in 25 years. Nobody wants to build them. The reason is the permitting time, the complexity, and the Superfund exposure. And the industry simply isn't building them. We are almost up to our maximum capacity of refining. Now we are going to take oil out of SPR. We are going to displace other oil. We don't have any significant unused refining capacity. 
   There is another factor in this consideration. What kind of signal does this send to Saddam Hussein? What kind of signal does it send to OPEC? It sends a signal that we are now dipping into our emergency supply. As we do, what does that do to our vulnerability? The Senator from Alaska believes it increases our vulnerability. It gives them more leverage. What are we going to fall back on then? What happens if we pull oil out of SPR and Iraq reduces production? We have a calamity. 
   This isn't just something that is happening in the United States. If there is any question about the severity, ask Tony Blair. The Government of Great Britain is teetering on the issue of oil. Germany, Poland, and many areas of Europe are coming to the United States. There is absolutely no question about it. 
   High oil prices have caused many Members, therefore, of this body to call for the release of SPR in a way to manipulate the price of crude. Some suggest as much as 30,000 barrels. One Senator was saying this action would bring OPEC to its knees. I think it will bring OPEC to its feet. They will say: Hey, there goes the United States; they are dipping into their reserve; now we've got them; we've have got the leverage. 
   I think it is highly unlikely that this action is well thought out. This is not what the reserve was intended for. It is not what the reserve is to be used for. I hope the administration will not weaken our national security by releasing oil to drive down prices because it won't necessarily drive down prices. 
   You are saying, well, the Senator from Alaska is from an oil-producing State, and he is just one man's opinion.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this article is entitled ``Summers Slams Plan to Sell Oil In U.S. Reserve.'' ``Treasury Secretary's Memo Says Greenspan Agrees It Would Be a Mistake.'' 
   The Washington by-line of the Wall Street Journal:  
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers advised President Clinton in a harshly worded memo that an administration proposal to drive down energy prices by opening the government's emergency oil reserve ``would be a major and substantial policy mistake.''  
   This isn't the Senator from Alaska. This is our Treasury Secretary.  
   Mr. Summers's vehement objection--which, he wrote, is shared by influential Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan ..... 
   Indeed, today Vice President Al Gore--in his role as Democratic presidential candidate--plans to call on the administration to conduct ``test sales'' from the SPR as part of what he called ``a major policy speech .....''  
   We have had a tradition of test sales from SPR under this administration. 
   In 1991, we offered 32 million barrels; in 1996, decommissioning Weeks Island, 5 million; 1996, the recession bill, 12 million. We had swaps, appropriations in 1997. What we did is we bought high and sold low. We lost hundreds of millions of dollars on our sale. I only assume the government figured they would make up the difference on the volume. 
   Our experience hasn't been very good. Let me get back to the other sale. Summers says it is a dangerous precedent.  
   He warned that the DOE's 60 million-barrel proposal would ``set a dangerous precedent'' by using the SPR to ``manipulate prices'' rather than adhering to its original purpose of responding to a supply disruption, and added that the move ``would expose us to valid charges of naivete'' for using ``a very blunt tool'' to address heating-oil prices. 
   Such a move, Mr. Summers argued, also would hurt the effectiveness of SPR in the  event of a real oil-supply crisis, diminishing the ``psychological value'' of using the SPR again if Iraq makes good on implied threats to cut oil output, and undercut Saudi Arabia's cooperation with the U.S. 
   GREENSPAN'S CLOUT 
   And he took the unusual step of invoking Mr. Greenspan, whose prestige has increasingly been used to influence economic-policy issues far beyond his purview of monetary policy. The letter begins: ``Chairman Greenspan and I believe that using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at this time, as proposed by DOE, would be a major and substantial policy mistake.''  
   I ask Members to consider the mechanical function of what has to take place. There are some people in this body who just assume you pull it out of SPR and, bang, it is there for the heating oil requirements of the Northeast Corridor, or it is there to relieve our pricing. It isn't. It is not a refined product. It has to be refined. It has to go to refineries. The refineries are operating at nearly full capacity, and when you pull it out of your reserve, it is like taking it out of your savings account. What do you do for an encore when the savings account is gone? We are certainly not going to replace SPR during this timeframe when oil prices are at an all-time high. We increase the vulnerability of the United States; we increase the potential for further increases in the price of oil. 
   There is one other point I want to make. The idea of a government-operated heating oil reserve, we don't really know what it means. But if I am in the business of storing heating oil, if I am a jobber in the Northeast and I know the government is going to store, I am not going to build up my reserve. Why should I? The government is going to take care of that. What does that do to the incentive of the private sector to build up reserves? 
   We have to think this thing through. I hope that the press will question the Vice President a little bit on the mechanics of what the net gain is. What does it do to our national security? Does it make us more vulnerable to OPEC? I also request the media to check on whether we have the authority or not--because the administration is begging us to pass EPCA, which gives us the authority, allegedly, to reauthorize the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We have a lot of bits and pieces that we haven't taken care of. 
   It will be interesting to see what kind of explanation the American public is given because so often it is very easy to spin the story that the answer is SPR. Do you know what the administration is doing? They are buying more time, hopefully, to get through this election because that is the bottom line. We are heading for a train wreck on energy. 
   I will throw a little bit more water in my remaining 2 minutes, not on SPR but on the realization of what is coming in the second show. The second show is natural gas; $5.35 per thousand cubic feet, October, next month. It was $2.16 6 months ago. Inventories are 15 percent below last winter's level. We will not have any new supply this winter. Fifty percent of American homes rely on natural gas and nearly 18 percent of the Nation's electric power. 
   There we have it. The administration doesn't have a plan. We have introduced legislation to get this matter back on course, the bottom line, as Senator LOTT and a number of us have joined together in coming down with what we think is a responsible energy plan that would increase the domestic supply. It would increase certain tax benefits that would ensure that we have the incentive in order to relieve the supplies associated with the realization that the next crash is coming on natural gas. 
   I wanted to identify the specific mechanics associated with the issue of opening up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and remind my colleagues that gas is right behind us in the crisis area, and the American taxpayer will bear the brunt of this. I hope the administration will rise to the occasion with some real relief. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair, and I thank my good friend from Alabama.  
   He indicated that the price of oil had risen. The price of oil yesterday rose to an all-time 10-year high, $37 a barrel. This is a very serious matter that is not receiving enough attention by this body, nor this administration. To give my colleagues an idea, from the Washington Post yesterday there was a quote that the price of crude oil contracts on the futures market on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose above $37 a barrel for the first time. 
   Here is the more significant point. Analysts predicted that the price jumps, 2.7 percent yesterday and a total of 44 percent for this year, could continue indefinitely. I repeat--could continue indefinitely, especially with the uncertainty connected with Iraq's Saddam Hussein and his accusations that Kuwait was drilling near the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border and stealing Iraq's oil. 
   Doesn't this sound a little like what happened in 1991 prior to the Persian Gulf war where we had the muscle demonstration by Saddam Hussein and later the implications of that war? 
   This is serious business. If you don't believe it is serious, ask Tony Blair because the stability of the British Government is very shaky right now as a consequence of the price of energy, a 10-year high, expectations for the price of oil go as high as $40 per barrel and beyond in the near future. 
   Why are we in this mess and why should American consumers care? I will discuss one segment of this today because Saddam Hussein has the world over a barrel. It is over a barrel of oil. 
   Why should American consumers care? Well, Iraq is now in a position to set the market price of oil--and therefore, what you pay at the pump, what you pay to heat your homes, what you pay at the grocery store, and what the Northeast Corridor residents are going to be paying in this country this winter for fuel. God help us if we have a cold winter. Iraq is using its profits illegally for weapons of mass destruction. They are threatening the peace and stability of the entire Mideast region. They represent a threat to the security of Israel without question. 
   Let us look at a little history on how this administration has basically failed to address this threat. Just before the Clinton-Gore administration came in, we carried out a very successful mission in Desert Storm. That mission was not without American casualties. We lost 147 Americans; 467 were wounded; 23 were taken prisoner. 
   Since that time, we have continued to enforce a no-fly zone. We have flown over 200,000 sorties since the end of Desert Storm, at a cost to the American taxpayer of about $50 million per month. Yet here we are today more reliant on Iraqi oil. We are addicted to the imported oil. We are addicted to oil. In any event, as a consequence of our decline in domestic production, which has been 17 percent since the Clinton Administration took office, and a 14-percent increase in domestic demand during the same period, we are now 58-percent dependent on imported oil. 
   During the Arab oil embargo--some remember this period of time, 1973--we had gas lines around the block at filling stations. The public was outraged. They were blaming everybody, including Government. That was 1973 when we were 36 percent dependent on imported oil; now we are at 58 percent. 
   Today Iraq is the fastest growing source of U.S. foreign oil, 750,000 barrels a day, nearly 30 percent of all Iraqi exports. We fought a war over there in 1991. Here we are dependent on Iraq. It makes us powerless to respond. Weapons inspections are unable to proceed. We are concerned about it, but we don't do anything. Illegal oil trading is underway with other Arab nations. We know it, we enforce a blockade in the air, we don't enforce any kind of a blockade for the illegal oil shipments that are going out of Iraq. Profits go to development of weapons of mass destruction, 
   training of the Republican Guards to keep Saddam Hussein alive. 
   The international community is becoming increasingly critical of sanctions towards Iraq. But consider this: Saddam Hussein puts Iraqi civilians in harm's way when we go over and bomb his targets. Saddam has used chemical weapons against his own people in his own territory. Saddam could have ended sanctions at any time. All he had to do is turn over his weapons of mass destruction; that is basically all. Yet he rebuilds his capacity to produce more. He cares more about these weapons, obviously, than he cares about his own people. 
   That he is able to dictate our energy future is an absolute tragedy of great proportion. Still, the administration refuses to act. What happened? 
   Saddam is getting more aggressive. His rhetoric in every speech at the conclusion is ``death to Israel.'' That is what he says. What is the threat to Israel's security? It is Iraq. He has announced a $14,000 bounty on any American plane shot down, for the anti-aircraft crew that is responsible. Now he is accusing Kuwait of stealing Iraqi oil. Here we go again. 
   That is the same thing that was done in 1990 shortly before he invaded Kuwait. Saddam is willing to use oil to gain further concessions. This is rather interesting, to show you the leverage he has because of his oil production. The U.N. was set to approve a $15 billion compensation measure for Kuwait as a result of damages from the Gulf war. That vote was set to take place next week. Iraq has retaliated and said: No, we are not going to pay that compensation. If you make us pay, we will reduce our output of oil. Now reports are that the U.N. has postponed that vote. 
   That is their leverage. There is likely not enough spare capacity in OPEC to make up the difference if Iraq pulls back it's production. Here is the Wall Street Journal headline: ``Iraqi Pumps Critical Oil and Knows It.'' That is the leverage of Saddam Hussein today, and his leverage is growing each and every hour. 
   This article says:  
   European oil executives familiar with Iraq say the U.N. sanctions against trading with Iraq are breaking down in the region. Turkey, Jordan, Qatar, Dubai, and Oman are still openly trading with Iraq. Sanctions aren't working. Now he is strong arming the U.N.  
   They have put off enforcing him to make compensation to Kuwait for the loss of damages associated with his invasion of that country. And his leverage is, hey, I will cut my oil production. The world can't afford to have that happen. Even if we took military action, we would need Saddam Hussein's oil to fuel our planes and bomb him.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Think about the simple equation of Saddam's influence over the world right now. You don't have to be a mental giant to reach any other conclusion, but we buy Saddam Hussein's oil. We send him the money. He pays his Republican guards and builds up his biological and chemical weapons capability. We take that oil, put it in our airplanes and fly over and bomb him. And the process starts all over again. What kind of a foreign policy is that? 
   How do we get back on course? Well, there is a solution. We have to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. We need to go through some avenues to do this. We need to increase our efficiency and maximize our utilization of alternative fuels and renewables. But we also have to increase domestic oil and gas production in this country. We have vast resources in areas like the overthrust belt in Wyoming, Colorado, and other States where we produce oil. We can produce more. But 64 percent of the public land has been withdrawn from exploration. Increased domestic supply is needed to lower prices, reduce volatility, and ensure safe and secure energy supply. 
   My State of Alaska has been producing about 20 to 25 percent of all the total crude oil produced in this country in the last 20-some years. We can produce more. We have the technology and we can do it safely. Give us an opportunity. Let us show the American can-do spirit. Let us meet the environmental concerns with technology, not rhetoric. 
   We must increase our domestic energy supply of oil to lower prices, reduce volatility, and ensure safe and secure energy supply. We have legislation to do it. Senator LOTT and I and others introduced the Energy Security Act of 2000, S. 2557. If enacted, It would guide us toward rolling back our dependence on foreign oil to below 50 percent. That is a goal, an objective of the bill. 
   To meet that goal, our bill would, among other things, increase domestic energy supplies of oil by allowing frontier royalty relief; improving Federal oil lease management; providing tax incentives for production, and assuring price certainty for small producers; allow new exploration in America's Arctic, in the Rocky Mountain States, and along the OCS areas for those States that want it; protect consumers against seasonal price spikes, especially with regard to Northeast heating oil users; foster increased energy efficiency, and provide new tax incentives for renewable energy to replace foreign oil. 
   The bottom line is, the Clinton-Gore energy policy and our increased dependence on Saddam Hussein is a travesty on the American people, the American mentality, and the American memory. We fought a war in Iraq, and now we are dependent on their resources and unable, or unwilling to do anything about it. Saddam is leveraging the issue by his dictate to the U.N. that he is not going to give them compensation. If they make him, he will simply cut his production, and the world can't afford to have that happen. 
   Finally, more U.S. dependence on foreign oil gives more leverage to Saddam Hussein to threaten regional stability. The administration seems powerless to respond for fear of cutting back on Iraqi exports. We are in a period almost as if it was during the last year of the Carter administration. Remember that time? We were being held hostage, if you will. We had hostages in our embassy in Iran. This time we have a country, a nation held hostage by Saddam Hussein. 
   What will the effect be? It is going to be at the gas pump and in your heating oil bill. I haven't even talked about natural gas, and I will not do that today. I want to remind my colleagues that we have been talking about oil today. Tomorrow we are going to talk about natural gas. Natural gas, a year ago, was $2.16. Today it is $5.40 for deliveries in October. The GOP energy plan would defuse Saddam Hussein's threat. The Clinton-Gore plan wants to stand by until the election is over. They hope they get away with it. 
   That concludes the amount of time allotted to me. Tomorrow I will talk about the price of natural gas and the effect it will have on the economy, your heating bills, and your electric bills. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to call the attention of my colleagues to an urgent matter, and that is the reauthorization of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The legislation is sitting here today and awaits clearance. It is contained in the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, or EPCA. 
   We have a hold on the passage of EPCA, which contains the Strategic Petroleum Reserve reauthorization. Also in the EPCA package is the Northeast home heating oil reserve. I know this is of great interest to Members from the Northeast, who are concerned, legitimately, about the potential of higher prices for home heating oil this fall and this winter, particularly if we should have a very cold winter. 
   The White House, the Secretary of Energy, has pleaded with Congress to pass EPCA, including the Strategic Petroleum Reserve reauthorization. I am chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. We passed a companion measure out of this committee. Now EPCA waiting on the floor. An effort was made last night to clear it. The administration claims it is an emergency that they have the reauthorization. They are contemplating going into the SPR and taking oil out of it to try an address this crisis. The merits of that deserve additional consideration by this body. 
   I will just share this observation on the logic of such a move. SPR is a reserve, it holds about a 50-day supply of oil, which is to be used in the case of emergency disruption of our foreign oil. Currently our dependence on foreign oil amounts to about 58 percent of our consumption. However, because of the high prices and the inadequacy of our refining industry, we are facing a train wreck relative to energy prices, gasoline, diesel, and other petroleum products. If it seems I am being a little ambitious in citing the critical nature of this crisis, let me tell you that the Government of Great Britain and Prime Minister Tony Blair find it a real issue relative to the stability and continuity of that Government. 
   The responses we have seen in Germany, England, Poland, and other countries to the increasing price of energy and what it means to the consumer is not only of growing concern, but it has reached a crisis mentality. During this country's last energy crisis, we had our citizens outraged. It was in 1973 when the oil embargo associated with the production from OPEC--it was called the Arab oil embargo--hit this country. We had gas lines around the block. People were mad, outraged, indignant. At that time, we were only 37-percent dependent on imported oil. Today, we are 58 percent. The Department of Energy contemplates we might be as high as 63 or 64 percent in the not too distant future. 
   The oil price yesterday was the highest in 10 years, more than $37 a barrel. There are those who predict it is going to go to $40 a barrel. Here we have the reauthorization of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, at the request of the administration, being held up by a Member on the other side of the aisle. There may be other reasons the Senator has seen fit to put a hold on this legislation. 
   I certainly would be happy to debate one of the issues that concerns activity in my State. It is the measure that allows power plants smaller than 5-megawatts to be licensed through a state procedure in Alaska. It would allow our Native people in rural areas to have clean, renewable energy rather than the high-cost diesel power they now burn. 
   I want to tell my colleagues, the Native people in Alaska really need this exemption. This is utilizing the renewable resource; namely, rainwater, snowfall. The inability of these small projects to support the cost of a Federal energy regulatory relicensing procedure--which is appropriate for large-scale projects--makes it absolutely beyond the capability of these small villages to utilize renewable resources associated with a 5 megawatt powerplant generated by water power. 
   I do not know whether there is an objection on the royalty-in-kind provision. No other Senator has indicated an objection, nor has the administration. It is hard to understand an objection when the provision simply says that the Secretary of the Interior may accept gas and oil in lieu of cash payments. The Department of the Interior has that power now and is using it in pilot projects. 
   The provision allows the Secretary more administrative flexibility to actually increase revenues from the Government's oil and gas royalty-in-kind program. Under current law, the Government has the option of taking its royalty share either as a portion of production--usually one-eighth or one-sixth--or its equivalent in cash. 
   Recent experiences with the MMS's royalty-in-kind pilot program has shown that the Government can increase the value of its royalty oil and gas by consolidation and bulk sales. Under royalty-in-kind, the Government controls and markets its oil without relying on its lessees to act as its agent. This eliminates a number of issues that have resulted in litigation in recent years and allows the Government to focus more directly on adding value to its oil and gas. 
   I would hope my appeal results in the administration, the Secretary of Energy, and others who believe very strongly that EPCA should be passed, including the reauthorization of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This action is especially timely, when indeed this country faces a crisis in the area of oil. I think the merits of the President having this authority at a time when we contemplated an emergency suggests the immediacy of the fact that this matter be resolved and addressed satisfactorily. We should adhere to the plea of the President to reauthorize SPR. I want the Record to note it is certainly not this side of the aisle that is holding this matter up. I would suggest it be directed by the appropriate parties to get clearance so we can pass EPCA out of this body.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me draw your attention to a very significant event that occurred last week which involved the nuclear utilities companies in this country prevailing in the spent fuel claims case. Now, to many, this might not seem to have great significance. Those of us on the Energy Committee have gone through a long and somewhat tedious process to try to address the federal government's obligation to encourage the Congress, specifically the Senate, to reach a decision on how we are going to dispose of our high-level nuclear waste, with a recognition that almost 20 percent of the power generated in this country comes from nuclear power. As a consequence of that, and the inability of the Government to fulfill its contractual commitment to take the waste in 1998, the industry in itself is, you might say, choking on the pileup of nuclear waste that is in temporary sites around reactors throughout the country. 
   Evidently, the administration does not value the sanctity of a contractual relationship very highly, because the ratepayers, over an extended period of years--several decades--have paid over 17 billion dollars into a fund which the Federal Government has managed, and that fund was specifically designed to permanently take the waste from the utility companies that generate power from nuclear energy. 
   The August 31, 2000 decision was highlighted in The Energy Daily. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the power companies are free to seek damages against the Energy Department for its failure to take responsibility for spent nuclear fuel. Undoubtedly, this will ``prompt dozens of new lawsuits seeking billions of dollars in claims against the Government,'' industry attorneys indicated last Friday. 
   Who is the Government? The Government is the taxpayers, Mr. President. As a consequence, the inability of the administration to meet its obligation under a commitment--a binding contract--results in the taxpayers being exposed to billions of dollars in damages.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to support passage of S. 1608, the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000. 
   This bill will restore the financial and resource management links between the rural communities of America and our natural resource agencies. 
   The precipitous drop in financial support for education and infrastructure needs of our rural counties will be restored by S. 1608. 
   These payments will now be steady and reliable. This bill also reverses the inward turning, and belt-way centered, thinking of resource managers by creating collaborative processes for natural resources management in our rural communities.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I compliment the occupant of the chair for being so patient at this late hour. 
   I rise to speak on behalf of permanent trade relations with China and in support of H.R. 4444, which is PNTR for China. I come to this body, after some 20 years, no stranger to China, having traveled there on numerous occasions, more recently a journey down the Yangtze River to observe the controversial construction of the building of the Three Gorges Dam. It has been a great concern by America's environmental community as to the legitimacy of this project. It will be one of the largest construction projects in the world. 
   But looking back at what we did in the United States in the 1930s with the TVA project, the flood control, the power generation, what we have done in the Columbia River system, it is very much in parallel to what China is attempting to do: flood control, power generation, and cleaning up their air. 
   It is interesting to reflect on the experience of U.S. participation in this project. The Eximbank believed that the project did not meet its environmental examination sufficiently so it exempted any U.S. firms from participating in the sense of funding two Chinese contractors to buy American equipment. As a result of the inability of the Eximbank to get a clearance on the environmental consequences and adequacy, there was no U.S. construction material that went into this. As a consequence, Caterpillar alone lost over $1 billion in sales. 
   I point this out to reflect on the merits of the current debate on certain restrictions that we should or should not have in association with PNTR for China. I know there is a great deal of interest in the business community. Some see it as a great opportunity. I see it as incremental gains for American businesses in the near term. But unlike many in the business lobby, my own feeling is that it is going to take a period of time. In my own State of Alaska, we may see some gains in agricultural and seafood exports, but for the most part, it is going to take a number of years to build up this trade. The question comes to mind: Are the gains worth the hew and cry this bill is bringing about and the extensive debate? 
   I have a little different view. Why, if I am not necessarily swayed by the arguments of the business community, do I rise in support of PNTR? As with most of my colleagues, I spent a good deal of time considering the merits of the debate. I have heard the arguments on both sides. I continue to listen carefully to the amendments proposed and the considered opinions of my colleagues, which I respect. Furthermore, as a member of the Finance Committee, I have discussed the subject. We have had debates as it played out over the course of the past weeks. I noticed throughout this time a reoccurring theme from both opponents and supporters of the bill. 
   We have tended throughout the course of these many months and whenever we have discussed China, either on the floor or in the committee, to refer to China as some sort of a monolith. We say China brutalizes her people. We say China represses religious freedom. We say China is the world's greatest proliferator of weapons of mass destruction, or we say we should not reward China for her misconduct by passing PNTR. 
   Occasionally, we are guilty in this body of painting in broad brush strokes. We have a tendency to generalize. We use verbal shortcuts. We say ``China'' when we mean China's Government or even certain members of China's Government. 
   In this instance, however, our reference to a monolithic China is not only misplaced, it goes to the heart of the fundamental misunderstanding regarding this bill. PNTR does not reward the Chinese Government. PNTR does not help the Chinese Government maintain repressive control. Passage of this bill, as has been pointed out, will not mean that China gets into WTO. They will get into WTO whether we vote for PNTR or not. 
   We are voting instead on a basic question of U.S.-China policy, whether trade with China is in America's national interest. 
   We talk a lot about the messages this vote will send to the Chinese Government. The message we should send is that we believe trade between American and the Chinese people should be fostered and should be strengthened. As I said at the outset, I do not believe American business interests are our primary concern in this matter. American foreign policy interests trump business interests in this matter. 
   So what is our primary foreign policy interest in China? Our primary foreign policy interest in China is to see the democratization of China. At the heart of this bill is nothing more than the formal recognition of the profound economic effect and shift in China which has occurred since 1979, when we first began the annual debate over our trade relationship with China. 
   In 1979, China's economy was dominated by Government-owned, Government-managed companies. This is the point that justifies my position on supporting PNTR, because we have seen a change since 1979, when the economy was dominated by Government-owned, Government-managed companies. Virtually 100 percent of China's gross national product at that time was derived from the industrial and commercial activities of not private enterprise but of Government. 
   Private enterprise simply didn't exist at that time. That is not the case anymore. 
   Twenty years after we began normal trade relations with China, private enterprise not only exists today in China but now it dominates the Chinese economy. The private sector accounts for nearly 70 percent of China's economic output, compared with just 30 percent for the Government-owned sector. 
   Normal trade relations with China are not the same as they were in 1979--again, that is my point--when all trade flowed through the Chinese Government. At that time, if we had said ``PNTR for China,'' we would have meant PNTR for the Chinese Government. Now the vast majority of trade with China is between private enterprise here and private enterprise there. PNTR means normal trade relations between American and Chinese peoples. 
   Now, an ever-increasing number of Chinese do not depend on the Chinese Government for their livelihoods, as they did back in 1979. By joining the World Trade Organization, China's reformers are attempting to add to the ranks of the private sector and deal a final blow to the bloated, anticompetitive, and inefficient state-owned enterprises. 
   The overwhelming consensus of experts on China's political economy is that China's attempt to join the WTO is a tactic to pressure the remaining state-owned enterprises to either privatize or fail. As such, the Chinese Communist Party is, in effect, making the ultimate admission that communism, for its practical purposes, is dead. Voting for PNTR is, in effect, recognition that the China of the year 2000 is a China of unprecedented economic self-determination--economic freedom for individual Chinese people. 
   Well, some of the skeptics say, big deal; Chinese citizens may have greater economic freedom, but they lack political freedom. That is true; I concede that. They say the Chinese lack religious freedom. True enough. They say the Chinese are unable to freely organize labor unions. True again. But to  say that PNTR will only strengthen the hand of China's Government I don't think is a credible argument. 
   The Chinese Communist Party is betting China can have a modern, efficient, capitalist economy, one that generates significant tax revenue, without giving up any political control. They are gambling that Chinese citizens will be happy to earn a better living and will be happy to pay taxes unquestioningly to their Government. That is the difference. This is a profound shift in a country in which the Government was responsible to support its citizens, rather than the citizens responsible to support the Government. That is a big change, Mr. President. 
   For years, China's governmental revenues have come directly from state-owned companies. That is where the revenue has come from. The profits of these enterprises go directly to the Government to fund its activities. But state-owned enterprises, as I have said, are inherently inefficient and are failing badly--more than 50 percent of them are de facto insolvent; they are broke; they cannot now provide the Chinese Government with the funds it needs. 
   For this reason, China's reformers have been pushing for a market economy led by a robust private sector--the private sector which will not deliver its profits directly to the Government but will, through its companies and employees, pay taxes to that Government. These days, entrepreneurs are not 
   paid by the Government; they pay to the Government. For the first time in the history of the People's Republic of China, the Government relies more on its citizens than its citizens rely on their Government. 
   Is taxation without representation a good bet for the Chinese Government? It seems to me we know a little about that here. We have had a few lessons from our own history that would be instructive to the Chinese Government. My own bet is that there is no better catalyst for democracy than a group of irate taxpayers. 
   Does supporting PNTR suggest that the Senate approves of the Chinese Government's actions to suppress freedom, organized labor, bully democratic Taiwan, or engage in missile proliferation? Not one bit. PNTR is nothing more than a recognition of the strides toward economic freedom the Chinese people have made. PNTR supports the Chinese people in their quest to break free of the yoke of communism. 
   What happens if we don't grant PNTR? Will the Chinese people applaud us for standing up for their rights? Will the Chinese people recognize that we believe our refusal to grant PNTR strikes a blow for political or religious freedoms? 
   No. The Chinese people will take it as a slight, a sense that we do not somehow want them to develop the economic freedoms that we in the United States enjoy today, a sense that the United States is the enemy of China's development. The Chinese Government, which has no longer any ideological claim to power, will employ this sense of U.S. antagonism to fuel the fires of Chinese nationalism. In our rush to help save the Chinese people from their Government, we will ourselves be the instrument of their further repression. 
   Let us not choose that course. Let us recognize that this bill encourages the growth of relations between Chinese and American citizens and vote to support PNTR. 
   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senators, GORTON, KERREY and JEFFORDS in introducing the Electric Power Industry Tax Modernization Act, legislation that will facilitate the opening up of the nation's energy grid to electricity competition. This landmark legislation demonstrates the good faith of the most important players in the industry--the investor owned utilities (IOUs) and the municipal utilities. 
   In the Energy Committee, which I currently Chair, we have held more than 18 days of hearings and heard testimony from more than 160 witnesses on electricity restructuring. Although those 160 witnesses had many differing views, every witness agreed that the tax laws must be rewritten to reflect the new reality of a competitive electricity market. 
   Already, 24 states have implemented laws deregulating their electricity markets. And the other 36 states are all considering deregulation schemes. Faced with that reality, the federal tax laws must be updated to ensure that tax laws which made sense when electricity was a regulated monopoly are not allowed to interfere with opening up the nation's electrical infrastructure to competition. 
   Last October I held a hearing in the Finance Committee Subcommittee on Long Term Growth to examine all of the tax issues that confront the industry. At the end of the hearing I urged all parties to sit down at the negotiating table and hammer out a consensus that will resolve the tax issues. 
   The bill we are introducing today reflects the compromise that has been reached between the IOUs and the municipal utilities. 
   One of the major problems that the current tax rules create is to undermine the efficiency of the entire electric system in a deregulated environment because these rules effectively preclude public power entities from participating in State open access restructuring plans, without jeopardizing the exempt status of their bonds. 
   No one wants to see bonds issued to finance public power become retroactively taxable because a municipality chooses to participate in a state open access plan. That would cause havoc in the financial markets and could undermine the financial stability of many municipalities. 
   The bill we are introducing overcomes this problem by allowing municipal systems to elect to terminate the issuance of new tax-exempt bonds for generation facilities in return for grandfathering existing bonds. In addition, the bill allows tax-exempt bonds to be issued to finance some new transmission facilities. 
   I recognize that in making these two changes in the tax law, the municipal utilities have given up a substantial financing tool that has been at the heart of the controversy between the municipal utilities and the IOUs. 
   At the same time, the bill updates the tax code to reflect the fact that the regulated monopoly model no longer exists. For example, the bill modifies the current rules regarding the treatment of nuclear decommissioning costs to make certain that utilities will have the resources to meet those future costs and clarifies the tax treatment of these funds if a nuclear facility is sold. 
   The bill also provides tax relief for utilities that spin off or sell transmission facilities to independent participants in FERC approved regional transmission organizations. 
   Another section of the bill changes the tax rules regarding contributions in aid of construction for electric transmission and distribution facilities. This is an especially important provision; however when this bill is considered in the Finance Committee, I intend to modify this proposal so that it is expanded to all contributions in aid of construction, not just for electric transmission and distribution. 
   The IOUs and the Municipal utilities are to be commended for coming up  with this agreement. However, there is one other element of the tax code that needs to be addressed if we are going to open the entire grid to competition. And that sector is the cooperative sector. 
   Currently, coops may not participate in wheeling power through their lines because of concern that they will violate the so-called 85-15 test. I urge the coops to sit down with the other utilities and reach an accord so that when we consider this legislation, the coops' will be included in a tax bill.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss two issues of great importance to our national security and our energy security--the agreement between the United States and the Russian Federation which provides for the conversion of Russian highly enriched uranium (HEU) derived from the warheads into fuel for civilian nuclear power plants, and the need for the United States to maintain a viable uranium enrichment capability. 
   First, let me give you a bit of history. 
   In 1992, the Energy Policy Act established the United States Enrichment Corporation as a wholly-owned government corporation to take over the Department of Energy's uranium enrichment enterprise. The Corporation was to operate as a business enterprise on a profitable and efficient basis and maximize the long-term valuation of the Corporation to the Treasury of the United States. The objective was to eventually privatize the Corporation as a viable business enterprise able to compete in world markets. Subsequently, the Corporation was selected as Executive Agent for, and entrusted with, the responsibility for carrying out the Russian HEU Agreement. 
   Enactment of the 1992 Act was the culmination of a decade of bipartisan effort spearheaded by Senators DOMENICI and Ford. Extensive hearings were held in both the House and the Senate and the legislation garnered the strong support of the Bush Administration. 
   Recognizing the complexity of privatization and the national security implications of the Russian HEU Agreement, Congress enacted the USEC Privatization Act of 1996. The Act provided the mechanics for privatization, clarified the relationship between a private USEC and the U.S. Government, and addressed concerns related to the implementation of the Russian HEU Agreement. The Corporation was sold in July of 1998. 
   Implementation of the Russian HEU Agreement has been important for the government and USEC. This government-to-government agreement facilitates Russian conversion of highly enriched uranium taken from their dismantled nuclear weapons into fuel purchased by USEC and resold for use in commercial nuclear power plants. The program is financed as a commercial transaction. 
   Every day, new warnings are heard about the ability of one rogue state or some well-financed terrorist to obtain weapons-grade nuclear materials on the black market. The Russian HEU Agreement addresses those concerns by converting thousands of nuclear warheads into fuel for electric power plants--the quintessential swords to plowshares concept. In spite of some start-up problems, implementation of the Agreement has resulted in the conversion of the equivalent of nearly 4,000 nuclear warheads into fuel for U.S. commercial power plants. The process, as well as purchases and shipments to USEC, continues. 
   From the outset, many felt there were built-in contradictions between the objectives of maintaining a viable domestic uranium enrichment capability while controlling the disposal of former Soviet nuclear weapons. But, all things considered, the program to date has been a success. 
   Without question our Nation's national security--our most important charge as lawmakers--has been enhanced by implementation of this Agreement. 
   Mr. President, the Russian HEU Agreement contributes to our Nation's security, but the Agreement also adversely affects the enterprise that makes this commercial solution to a national security problem possible. This difficulty was understood when the government adopted this program. Purchases of large quantities of Russian weapons derived material result in growing effects on the companies in the private sector domestic nuclear fuel cycle. Our uranium mining, conversion, and enrichment industries have been affected. The result has been steadily declining market prices for all phases of the nuclear fuel cycle. USEC, its plant workers, and the communities dependent upon those plants are being hit especially hard. As Executive Agent, USEC has suffered substantial losses due to fixed price purchases from Russia as well as increased costs due to reduced levels of domestic production resulting from introduction of the Russian material into the market. 
   Earlier this year, and with the support of the Administration, USEC had been negotiating with Russia to amend the Agreement to include market-based pricing. I have been advised that USEC closely coordinated its plans and intentions with the President's Interagency Enrichment Oversight Committee at all phases of its discussions with the Russians. Yet, as USEC and the Russians were meeting in Moscow to sign the new Agreement, the Department of Energy, a member of the Oversight Committee, prevented the signing at the last minute. 
   I can not understand why the Energy Department would prevent the adoption of an amendment that would stabilize the Agreement through the remaining thirteen years of the program. Reportedly the terms were acceptable to both parties. In addition, the Agreement would have protected the interests of our own domestic nuclear fuel industry. As part of the Agreement, Russia wanted USEC to purchase commercially produced enrichment in addition to the weapons derived enrichment. USEC negotiated terms consistent with a previous Administration approved program making it mandatory that this additional quantity be matched with domestically produced enrichment. In addition, no additional natural uranium would be brought into the domestic market. The amendment to the Agreement was specifically crafted so that no damage would be inflicted upon the domestic nuclear fuel cycle as a result of purchasing the additional material. 
   The Department of Energy's action threatens to destabilize the agreement.  Who knows how long the Russians will sit by without this Agreement. The National Security Council and the State Department and others on the Enrichment Oversight Committee have endorsed the signing of this Agreement. I strongly urge that it be completed. I suggest that those of us in the Congress who believe in the vital importance of this Agreement express our concern to the Administration and demand that the Energy Department withdraw its objection and that the Agreement be speedily signed. 
   As I mentioned, higher production costs, decreased demand, and lower world prices have hit USEC, our Nation's sole domestic uranium enricher, particularly hard. USEC's Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the quarter ended March 31, 2000 noted that: ``In February 2000, Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service revised their credit ratings of USEC's long-term debt to below investment grade. The revised rating gives USEC the ability to discontinue its uranium enrichment operations at a plant. USEC is evaluating its options; however, a decision has not been made as to whether to close a plant, which plant would be 
   selected or the timing of any closure.'' Finally, on June 21, the Board of Directors of USEC Inc. voted to cease uranium enrichment operations in June 2001 at the Portsmouth gaseous diffusion plant in Piketon, Ohio, and to consolidate all enrichment operations at its Paducah, Kentucky production plant. USEC maintained that it could not sustain current operations at two production plants, each of which is currently operating at only 25 percent of capacity. The company said that its production costs were too high and that the termination of operations at Portsmouth would save upwards of $55 million in fixed costs annually. 
   USEC's decision to close a plant comes as no surprise. For over a year, there has been speculation within the Clinton Administration, the energy industry, the media and on Capitol Hill that USEC would be forced to consolidate its uranium enrichment production. 
   Mr. James R. Mellor, Chairman of USEC's Board of Directors was quoted in a news release as saying: ``The decision to cease enrichment at one of our facilities was necessary given the business challenges facing the uranium enrichment industry ..... Mr. Mellor went on to say: ``Choosing to close the Portsmouth plant was an extremely difficult decision because of the impact it will have on the lives of many of our workers, their families and the communities surrounding the plant.'' 
   USEC cited multiple factors in determining which plant would close. Key elements in USEC's analysis included ``long-term and short-term power costs, operational performance and reliability, design and material condition of the plants, risks associated with meeting customer orders on time, and other factors relating to assay levels, financial results, and new technology issues.'' 
   I know that my colleagues from Ohio are deeply disturbed by USEC's decision to close the Portsmouth plant. I also know that if the company had chosen to cease operations at Paducah, my friends from Kentucky would be equally distraught. Plant closures are serious matters, particularly when they are the mainstay of the local economy. The public record is clear that technological advances in uranium enrichment were rapidly overtaking the gaseous diffusion process as an economic method of enriching uranium. Make no mistake, the Portsmouth and Paducah gaseous diffusion plants were and continue to be extraordinary engineering, design, and construction achievements--matched only by the dedication and skill of the men and women who have made the plants work--work, 24 hours a day--work, seven days a week--work, continuously for over 45 years without a stop, without a break in service--until now. It was inevitable that this would happen someday, but knowing that it will happen does not make it any easier. 
   The only person who seemed to be caught by surprise and unprepared to deal with the closure was the Secretary of Energy. Certainly, he must have known that USEC was preparing to make an announcement. He must have been aware that, as part of the 1996 USEC Privatization Act, the Department of Energy--not the company--would be responsible for decommissioning, decontamination and clean-up of the plants and the sites as well as for workforce disposition. 
   In fact, in a June 19, 2000 letter to Mr. William H. Timbers, USEC's president and chief executive officer, the Secretary of Energy asked if the company was planning to close either one of its uranium production facilities. In response, Mr. Timbers wrote on June 20, 2000, that ``during our last meeting, I indicated to you, and reiterated in subsequent meetings with your staff, that it is inevitable that USEC must close one of its enrichment facilities.'' Mr. Timbers added that ``During 
   the last eight months, we have presented numerous proposals--still pending before you--to accomplish [transition]. But, DOE has yet to make a decision. We have also engaged in discussions with PACE union leadership aimed at advancing these efforts. We are still ready and eager to translate these discussions into actions and look forward to the prospect of working with DOE to adopt a program to minimize the employment disruption associated with ensuring a financially sound USEC under today's market conditions.'' 
   The next day, when USEC announced that its Board of Directors had voted to close the Portsmouth facility, the best the Nation's Secretary of Energy could come up with was the following statement: ``I am extremely disappointed by [USEC's] decision today to close the uranium enrichment plant at Portsmouth. First and foremost, I am very concerned about the effect this closure will have on USEC workers. Many of these men and women spent their entire working lives helping our nation win the Cold War. They deserve better treatment.....'' 
   For once, Secretary Richardson and I agree. The workers do deserve better. But rather than threatening USEC, as the Secretary of Energy did when he recommended ``serious consideration of replacing USEC as executive agent'' for the Russian HEU Agreement, he should have been drafting a plan to assist the workers in Portsmouth to make the transition from operating the Department of Energy owned gaseous diffusion plant to cleaning up the site. This is an environmental restoration mission that is likely to take many years. We are all aware of the environmental contamination at the plants and the desperate need for action to restore them to reasonable environmental condition. 
   When Congress created the United States Enrichment Corporation as part of the 1992 Energy Policy Act, and when we later passed the 1996 USEC Privatization Act, we recognized that a privately owned USEC could better respond to the needs of the marketplace and thereby sustain a viable domestic uranium enrichment capability. Now that USEC has taken what it believes is a necessary step to ensure that it can compete in the world uranium enrichment marketplace, the first response by the Secretary of Energy is to second-guess the company's intentions and actions. Apparently the Secretary would keep facilities open regardless of the fundamental laws of economics that are evident to even the most modest businesses. 
   It has been suggested that the solution is to nationalize USEC--to have the government buy it back. I have no sympathy for such a proposal. While I am sympathetic to those who will be affected by the closure of Portsmouth, I do not believe that a return to the past is the remedy that will provide for a competitive domestic uranium enrichment capability in the future. I do not favor an appropriation of substantial sums, perhaps well over a billion dollars to buy USEC back, nor do I favor the then obligatory commitment to annually appropriate funds to make up for uneconomic operations. 
   It has been only two years since we privatized USEC. On the one hand the Congress and the Administration made an extraordinary effort to provide a private USEC with a strong foundation for a successful private enterprise competing in world markets--in the words of the '96 Act `` ..... in a manner that provides for the long-term viability of the Corporation .....'' But at the same time, contradictory restraints imposed on the Corporation detract from its ability to compete. In retrospect, perhaps Congress and the Administration should not have placed so many burdens on USEC as it faced private sector  dynamics and demands. Ensuring that the vital national security interests of the United States are protected is paramount, but preserving the competitiveness of our domestic uranium enrichment capability--at minimal costs to the federal government--is important too. We need to stop thinking of USEC as a Federal agency and respect it for what it is--a private business enterprise. 
   Challenges remain in the implementation of the Russian HEU Agreement and the long-term viability of the domestic uranium enrichment enterprise. These have proven to be complex, and at times conflicting tasks, but I believe that the National interest more than justifies our continued efforts to see these programs through to a successful conclusion. As part of these efforts we should encourage the Clinton Administration to approve the market-based pricing amendment to the Russian HEU Agreement. Now is also the time to secure a future for the workers in Portsmouth who face plant closure. We need to help them achieve their third transition--from Cold War patriots, to peacetime producers of fuel, to the task of environmental restoration 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation to improve the operation of the Arctic Research and Policy Act. We have about 15 years of experience with this Act, and the time has come to make some modifications to reflect the experience we have gained over that time. 
   The most important feature of this bill is contained in Section 4. This section authorizes the Arctic Research Commission, a Presidential Commission, to make grants for scientific research. Currently, the Commission can make recommendations and set priorities, but it cannot make grants. Our experience with the Act and the Commission has shown us that research needs that do not fit neatly in a single agency do not get funded, even if they are compelling priorities. 
   One example is a proposed Arctic contamination initiative that was developed a few years ago after we discovered that pollutants from the Former Soviet Union--including radionuclides, heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants--were working their way into the Arctic environment. It became clear that the job of monitoring and evaluating the threat was too big for any single agency. The Interior Department, given its vast land management responsibilities in Alaska, was interested. The Commerce Department, given the jurisdiction over fisheries issues, was interested. The Department of Health and Human Services, given its concern about the health of Alaska's indigenous peoples, was interested. The only agency that didn't seem interested in the problem, strangely enough, was the EPA, which at the time was in the process of dismantling its Arctic Contaminants program. 
   Unfortunately, because the job was too big for any single agency, it was difficult to get the level of interagency cooperation necessary for a coordinated program. Moreover, agencies were unwilling to make a significant budgetary commitment to a program that wasn't under their exclusive control. If the Arctic Research Commission, which recognized the need, had some funding of its own to leverage agency participation and help to coordinate the effort, we would know far more about the Arctic contaminants problem than we do today. 
   Another example is the compelling need to understand the Bering Sea ecosystem. Over the past 20 years we have seen significant shifts in some of the populations comprising this ecosystem. King crab populations have declined sharply. Pollock populations have increased sharply. Steller sea lion populations have declined as have many types of sea birds. Scientists cannot tell us whether these population shifts are due to abiotic factors such as climate change, biotic factors such as predator-prey relationships, or some combination of both. Because the nation depends on this area for a significant portion of all its seafood, this is not an issue without stakeholders. Despite the chorus of interests and federal agencies that have said research is needed, a coordinated effort has not yet occurred. If the Arctic Research Commission, which recognized this need early on, had some funding of its own to leverage agency participation and help to coordinate the effort, we would know far more about the Bering Sea ecosystem than we do today. 
   This bill also makes a number of other minor changes in the Act: 
   Section 2 allows the Chairperson of the Commission to receive compensation for up to 120 days per year rather than the 90 days per year currently allowed by the Act. The Chairperson has a major role to play in interacting with the Legislative and Executive branches of the government, representing the Commission to non-governmental organizations, in interacting with the State of Alaska, and serving in international fora. In the past, chairpersons have been unable to fully discharge their responsibilities in the 90 day limit specified in the Act. 
   Section 3 authorizes the Commission to award an annual award not to exceed $1,000 to recognize either outstanding research or outstanding efforts in support of research in the Arctic. The ability to give modest awards will bring recognition to outstanding efforts in Arctic Research which, in turn, will help to stimulate research in the Arctic region. This section also specifies that a current or former Commission member is not eligible to receive the award.  
   Section 5 authorizes official representative and reception activities. Because the Commission is not authorized to use fund for these kinds of activities, the Commission has experienced embarrassment when they were unable to reciprocate after their foreign counterparts hosted a reception or lunch on their behalf. Under this provision, the Commission may spend not more than two tenths of one percent of its budget for representation and reception activities in each fiscal year. 
   Mr. President, the Arctic Research and Policy Act and the Arctic Research Commission has worked well over the past 15 years. It can work even better with these modest changes. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this bill as soon as possible.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, on several occasions I have risen before this body to address the crisis associated with energy in our Nation today. We have all experienced the high price of gasoline. We have seen a slight reduction of late, but I want to assure my colleagues that that situation is temporary, at best. 
   The rationale for that is understandable if one considers the fact that we are currently consuming just about an amount equal to the productive capacity of our industry to supply gasoline. There are many good reasons for this. One is that we haven't built a new refinery in this country for almost 10 years now. We have closed about 37 refineries in the United States in the last decade and, as a consequence of our increased dependence on imported oil, we have lost a good deal of our leverage because currently about 56 percent of the oil we consume in this country is imported. Most of that comes from the Mideast. As a consequence, we have become more dependent on imported oil from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. 
   The fastest-growing supply of oil now coming into the United States is from Iraq. That is rather curious. A lot of people forget that in 1991 we fought a war over there. We lost 147 lives. We had nearly 427 wounded. We had a number taken prisoner. Yet Saddam Hussein is the one we are looking toward now. 
   I think the American public should be aware that it is pretty difficult to define just what the energy policy of the Clinton-Gore administration has been. We have seen their policy with regard to the nuclear industry, which provides about 20 percent of the power generated in this country, and they have said no to storing high-level nuclear waste. We are one vote short of a veto override on that matter. We have not been able to generate that last vote. So it is clear that the administration has said no to the nuclear industry, as far as expanding its contribution to energy in this country. 
   As we look to hydroelectric, we have seen a policy which suggests that perhaps some of the dams out West should be taken down, with no consideration for the realization that there is a tradeoff associated with that. If you take those dams down, you are taking the tonnage that is moved by barge and putting it on the highways. The implication of that is significant. It is estimated that as many as 700,000 trucks per year would have to go on the highways to replace the current cargo capacity of barges that would be lost. 
   If we take away nuclear and go to hydro, oil is certainly something we are looking toward other nations to provide, as opposed to developing the resources here in the continental United States, in the overthrust belt of Colorado, Wyoming, and other areas, and where there is oil in my State of Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico, Texas, and other States. It is my understanding that the administration has withdrawn about 64 percent of the public land in the overthrust belt, which is in the Rocky Mountain areas, excluding them from the development of energy resources. 
   The potential for coal, of course, is significant. There are no new coal plants being built in this country. The cost of permitting is such that we find they are uneconomical. The emphasis seems to be on natural gas. But if we look to the last 6 months, we have seen natural gas prices go from about $2.16 to over $4 for delivery later this winter. 
   The crisis associated with our energy policy, or lack of an energy policy, is real in every field of energy resources. Emphasis is placed by the administration to some extent on renewables. While we all support renewables, it is fair to say that renewables only constitute about 40 percent of our energy consumption, even though we have spent about $70 billion in subsidies in this area. While they have a potential, surely they are not at the forefront nor are they capable at this time of relieving our dependence on conventional energy sources. 
   As we look at our policies today, I think there is confusion in the minds of Americans as they reflect on the statements of their political leaders and the policies they pursue. It is very easy to be confused. 
   I would like to share some examples with my colleagues. 
   If we go back to our Vice President, AL GORE, in his book ``Earth in the Balance,'' AL GORE, the environmentalist, wrote that ``higher taxes on fossil fuel ..... is one of the logical first steps in changing our policies in a manner consistent with a more responsible approach to the environment.'' 
   All of us are obviously concerned over the health of our environment. We want to have a responsible approach associated with the environment. Nevertheless, the idea that raising the price of gasoline is good for the American economy and good for the American people is pretty hard to sell to the American public at this time when gasoline prices, depending on where we are in the country, range anywhere from $1.75 to $1.95 or higher. 
   I think it is fair to say that perhaps the Vice President overlooks the reality that Americans live long distances from their jobs because they prefer to do so. We are a mobile society. As we are confronted with higher energy prices, obviously it not only affects our pocketbooks, but it affects inflation rates. 
   At about the same time that the Clinton/Gore administration was talking about conservation, the Vice President was casting a tie-breaking vote in the Senate to raise gasoline taxes--we all remember that--and the Environmental Protection Agency determined that more expensive ``reformulated gasoline'' needed to be sold in many areas of the country. 
   I am not arguing the merits of that--other than to report that before my committee on Energy and Natural Resources, one of the principals of the Environmental Protection Agency advised us that they are now required under the Clean Air Act to have nine different types of reformulated gasoline in this country. 
   That meant our refiners had to batch the gasoline additives, they had to transport it separately, they had to store it separately. Obviously, all of that has a significant cost for the taxpayer. According to a memorandum from the Department of Energy and the Congressional Research Service, EPA's gasoline requirements balkanized markets, strained supplies, and raised prices. 
   Since the policies of the administration were so effective in raising the prices, one might expect the Vice President to be pleased. But confronted with angry consumers on the campaign trail, the Vice President suggests that refiners and oil companies are to blame. A lot of finger-pointing is going on around here. 
   Let me refer to an article that appeared in the Washington Times of July 19. This is an editorial covering a memorandum that came from the Clinton Energy Department suggesting that the Department was indeed aware that the administration's own regulations pertaining to so-called ``reformulated'' gasoline, rather than the oil industry gouging, were primarily responsible for the 
   increased price of motor fuels. 
   The reformulated gas--RFG--rule, which stipulated that refiners mix different types of gasoline for different localities, has made it impossible, or at least very difficult, to take advantage of the economies of scale in production and distribution that heretofore have helped keep U.S. energy prices stable and low. 
   Their memo, which was sent June 5--a full week before the administration began to blame the oil industry for raising fuel prices--states that the RFG reformulated gasoline rule was a major reason for the price spike, delaying claims made by the administration that they couldn't see any reason other than blind greed for the change in per-gallon gasoline prices.  
   I am not here to defend the industry, but I think it is fair to say that for the administration and the media to simply overlook what the cost of reformulated gasoline, applied regionally in this country with nine specific types of reformulated gasoline, has done to the price of gasoline speaks for itself. 
   It is kind of interesting. This article said something to the effect that the media and Dan Rather stated during the July 14 broadcast that, ``Republicans today sided with the oil companies against the Clinton/Gore administration on the question of who and what is to blame for higher gasoline prices.'' 
   When you invoke this type of mandate on the first of June, you are certainly going to get a reaction from the American public when the price of reformulated gasoline goes up dramatically, particularly in the Midwest. That is what is known around here--and we are no strangers to it--as ``dancing the sidestep.'' 
   Another example of the Clinton/Gore administration's attitude towards energy goes back a little further, when we needed Russia's support--or at least its acquiescence--in NATO's war in Kosovo. There is strong evidence that the administration sought to persuade OPEC to cut production and drive crude oil prices up some 18 months ago. It seems this was done to help Russia, an oil exporter generally badly in need of hard currency, in exchange for its acquiescence--which we got--in NATO's war in Kosovo. 
   Despite the fact that his own administration colluded with OPEC to manipulate prices, our Vice President has called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate oil companies and refiners--for colluding to manipulate prices. I don't know how long that is going to take, but I suspect it is going to take some time for that investigation to be completed. In any event, I find that highly ironic. 
   Here is another example. 
   We have all heard that our Vice President says he wants to reduce our dependence on foreign sources of oil in the volatile Middle East. But his stated policy is to curtail Federal oil and gas leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf. We heard him make that statement in Louisiana, that, if elected, he would terminate leases and buy back others. 
   He would also defer any opening of public land in the Rocky Mountain Overthrust Belt in Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado. He also urged the President to veto a 1995 bill allowing a small sliver of the Alaska Coastal Plain to be opened for oil and gas exploration. 
   That area, I might add, in my State of Alaska, could have enough oil to replace imports of Saudi Arabian oil for the next 30 years. It is estimated the area might contain as much as 16 billion barrels. Of further note, the area known as ANWR has 19 million acres, most of which is already set aside in wilderness. The remaining acreage, 1.5 million acres, is left for Congress to make a determination on. The industry says that out of that 1.5 million acres, oil is in abundance. With the advancement of technology we have in building icy roads in the wilderness, the footprint will be less than 2,000 acres. 
   Clearly, the Clinton-Gore administration will not give us an opportunity to make a determination whether domestically we can reduce our dependence on imported oil and develop this very important resource in my State of Alaska. 
   Over the past 8 years, domestic production in this country has plummeted 17 percent as demand for foreign oil has risen 14 percent. We now depend on foreign oil to supply 56 percent of our needs. The averages of the last few weeks are as much as 64 and 65 percent. However, during the disastrous 1973 Arab oil embargo, we were only 35-percent dependent. Some of my colleagues remember we had gasoline lines around the block. The public was mad. They were upset and blamed the Government. Their rhetoric and policy just doesn't match up. We are now in the year 2000 and we are on average in excess of 56 percent dependent on foreign imports. 
   Our Vice President also says we must increase our use of cleaner-burning natural gas to replace ``dirty coal.'' But his policy is to put the most promising areas for the discovery and production of natural gas off limits to exploration. I refer to another quote he made October 22 at a campaign appearance in Rye, NH. Our Vice President said: I will do everything in my power to make sure there is no new drilling, even in areas of the OCS already leased by previous administrations. 
   This is yet another example of what folks find confusing. Our Vice President, in his book, ``Earth in the Balance,'' wrote: Mining inffluent must return to the Earth as pure as they came. 
   But did you know that the Vice President, with his family, certainly don't follow this practice, pocketing $20,000 a year in mining royalties from the zinc mine on his Carthage, TN, property. He has pocketed $500,000 over the past 25 years. Considering this zinc mine has contaminated the banks of the Caney Fork River with heavy metal--that is in this general area. This is the Caney Fork River. This is the area that is concentrated with pollutants from the leaching field. This is the actual area where the mines are. This is the leaching field. This is the Gore complex above. They have had violations of clean water standards from time to time. It is clear that the mine does not meet standards set forth in the Vice President's book. I am sure however, that the royalty checks got cashed.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Again, it is not my desire to criticize somebody because they own a mine or have a resource interest, but there is a certain criticism when one recognizes the reality that this mine is hardly a model for anyone, based on the number of violations that have been filed in Tennessee over an extended period of time on this particular mine. 
   We know the Vice President has been critical of some; namely George W. Bush, for his close ties to big oil. In fact, the Vice President's family has close historical ties to Occidental Petroleum and shares in that company which, in its public disclosure, is valued between $500,000 to $1 million. Occidental Petroleum plans to drill in the ancestral lands of over 5,000 U'wa Indians in the Colombia rain forest. They threatened suicide if Occidental goes forward with its plans.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. We have heard that the Vice President and the administration tried to stop drilling in Alaska with expressions of concern for the G'wichin Indians, some of which reside in Alaska, and others which reside in Canada. 
   But has he spoken out for the U'was in Colombia? Is there an inconsistency here? On the one hand, he allows, and evidently ignores, the drilling in the Colombia rain forest on leases owned by Occidental Petroleum, and he seems to have no objection. But in an area the G'wichin Indians in Alaska depend on for subsistence, a significant area which is in the purview of the Senate to make decisions for opening, he does not support oil and gas exploration. My point is, there is an inconsistency here. 
   The weight of their policy as it twists and reinvents itself is a mystery to me as I try to summon a clear vision of their intent. His beliefs are a confusing world of images and contradictions. I suspect it might be difficult for others, as well.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I am also going to take the opportunity to address an issue that some time ago my Committee on Energy and Natural Resources asked the General Accounting Office to provide a detailee to conduct a preliminary inquiry into payments made by the Project On Government Oversight to two Federal officials. The Project On Government Oversight is known as ``POGO.'' This report was received by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. It was prepared by Paul Thompson, the detailee from the General Accounting Office. It is dated July 2000. 
   There is no question in my mind after reviewing this that the inspector general of the Department of the Interior should be required to review this report and respond to our Committee. I think it is fitting that the Attorney General, Janet Reno, address and resolve some of the questions that are raised by the inquiry. 
   Let me share some of them. I read as follows from the report of the POGO on July 2000. 
   Conclusions 
   It appears that POGO paid the two Federal officials in connection with their activities to influence the Department toward taking actions and adopting policies that, among other things, (a) directly and indirectly assisted POGO in a project involving matters in which these two individuals were substantially involved as Federal employees and that led to POGO's filing of a lawsuit through which it and the two officials received substantial sums of money and stand to receive potentially millions of dollars more, and (b) benefited the professional and business interests of POGO's chairman and a client of his law firm. The circumstances associated with the payments raised the possibility that the Department of the Interior's development of the policy underlying the new oil royalty regulations may have been improperly influenced by expectations or understandings of the officials that they could personally benefit from using their positions as Federal employees to assist POGO and two of its principals. The officials were substantially involved in key stages of the Department's policy development process in ways that served the interests of the POGO's chairman and its executive director. Whether the payments and circumstances under which they were made could serve to erode confidence in the Department's administration of the royalty management program is a well grounded concern. 
   Madam President, the entire transcript of the committee report on POGO, prepared for the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, is available from the committee's website at http://www.energy.senate.gov.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as I enter the Chamber and look to the rear to the seat occupied by our dear friend, the late Senator PAUL COVERDELL, it reminds me of the reality of the fragility of the lives we lead. The message is one of taking stock of what our real priorities are. Life is so short, so fragile, and our period on Earth is so temporary. 
   At this time we join together in grieving with the family of our beloved colleague who passed away Tuesday evening. Our thoughts and prayers are certainly with his wife Nancy and the family during their time of extraordinary grief. 
   We all share in the reality that this was a tragic and unexpected loss. We all feel it in this Chamber, in the halls of the Senate office buildings and, of course, in PAUL's beloved State of Georgia. But we cannot be blinded by grief to the point that we fail to recognize and celebrate the life of this outstanding public servant. 
   He was an extraordinary public servant. I listened to some of the comments made last night after we learned of his passing. The Senator from New York said he was a man of peace. Reflecting on PAUL's public service, he served his country in the Army, with deployments in Okinawa, Korea, and the Republic of China, came home to Georgia, joined the family business, helped it thrive and grow and then, beginning in 1970, served his State in the legislature, serving as minority leader for a period of 15 years. In 1989, he continued his commitment to peace as Director of the Peace Corps. In this capacity, PAUL saw the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of the Cold War. He seized the opportunity to place Peace Corps volunteers in former Eastern Bloc nations in an effort to speed their transition to democracy and peace. 
   The wise people of Georgia, in 1992, elected PAUL to the U.S. Senate. I vividly recall that this genuine, quiet man made an immediate impression upon all of us. As we got to know PAUL, we found him to be deeply thoughtful, hard-working, and utterly unconcerned about the limelight. His Republican colleagues recognized his efforts and selected him to the leadership post of Republican Conference Secretary. 
   As a U.S. Senator, PAUL did superb work in the issues of education, food safety, protecting our children from drugs, promoting volunteerism, lowering the tax burden on working families and small business, and protecting the rights of citizens in their dealings with the Internal Revenue Service. 
   We were all privileged to know PAUL. He enriched our lives. My prayers and thoughts are with PAUL's family, especially his wife Nancy. The Senate will miss his work ethic and thoughtfulness. The Nation will miss his ideas and his example. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I held a hearing on this issue and on S. 1797--that bill will provide a grant of lands. While I would be happy to have that bill passed into law, I plan to work to that end. However, to assure that Craig is not left with nothing, I would also support this solution. It is my hope that one of these two approaches can be accomplished this year. 
   My committee's hearing provides a clear record that Craig is in a unique position being the fastest growing city in Alaska and the regional center for Prince of Wales Island. The city fathers are struggling to keep up with the demands for services as people from all over the island move to Craig looking for work. The city submitted its financial records which showed its problems. Our committee responded with S. 1797.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to chat a little bit about energy this evening because there are several misconceptions relative to the position that the United States is currently in relative to the high gasoline prices that we have been subjected to in the last several months. 
   First of all, the bad news is, there is no relief in sight. What we currently have is a situation where, simply, the available refining capacity associated with gasoline production and the demand is such that the two lines are almost parallel. In other words, our ability to produce gasoline and the current consumption of gasoline are about equal. So as a consequence, in reality, we are drawing down our reserves. This is at a time when normally our reserves would be substantially higher. 
   There is a reason for this. I think the American people should understand and appreciate reality because what we have is a situation where our refining capacity has been reduced dramatically over the last 8 years. We have lost about 37 refineries in the United States during the last 10-year period. There has not been a new refinery built in the United States in almost two decades. 
   What we have, then, is a concentration of our existing refineries operating at near full capacity, producing the requirements associated with the public's demand for gasoline, coupled with the problems associated with meeting the Clean Air Act, which mandates certain reformulated gasolines in various parts of the country. 
   We had testimony before the committee of which I am chairman, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, earlier last week. One of the principals with the Environmental Protection Agency identified that the Environmental Protection Agency, under their interpretation of the Clean Air Act, has mandated as many as nine specific cuts of reformulated gasolines that have a regional application around the country. That means in California you have one type of reformulated gasoline. You have another type in Chicago. You may have another type in Atlanta. 
   These have gone into effect as a consequence of the June 1 new mandates for reformulated gasoline in various parts of the country. What this means is, the refineries have to separate and move and store separately these different cuts of gasoline. The cost, of course, is significant from the standpoint of what the American public has to pay. 
   We have seen, since the spiraling price of crude oil over the last year--where a year ago prices were $11, $12, $13, $14 a barrel--an average price of nearly $30 a barrel this year. 
   The difficulty we experience is, having become so dependent on imported  oil, currently imported oil is running at 56 percent of total U.S. consumption. As we look at our neighbors in OPEC, we recognize that we have an increasing dependence on their resources. In other words, they control the supply and we are the market. As a consequence, when we have significant demand increases of consumption, we go to OPEC, as our Secretary of Energy has done from time to time, encouraging more production. 
   However, OPEC seems to have learned from experience. They have developed a strategy internally where they have set a price floor and a price ceiling. The floor evidently is $22 a barrel of oil; the ceiling is $28 a barrel. In recent days, there has been an anticipation that OPEC will increase production, today we have the president of OPEC indicating that since the price fell temporarily below $28 a barrel, OPEC was not going to increase production and was going to review the matter in another 20 days. 
   The American public should be aware that we are caught between a floor-to-ceiling $22 to $28. The American public should be aware that as a consequence of OPEC's internal discipline, there is no relief in sight for a reduction of gas prices of anything appreciable. There will be perhaps some regional reductions as we get the reformulated gasoline under control in various parts of the country. 
   It is also important to recognize that one of the most significant additives, MTBE, has been dismissed as contrary to the health of the public in the sense that this reformulated portion does get into the water table. As a consequence, we are substituting ethanol for MTBE, which is a grain and agriculture product that enjoys a partial subsidy but nevertheless is a satisfactory additive to make reformulated gasoline to meet the market demands in the various regions of the country. 
   The point I want to make is that on gasoline, our demand is up. Our production is relatively stagnant, even though we are producing at the maximum capacity for our refineries. We have a situation where we are actually pulling down our reserves. For many Members of this body, particularly in the Northeast corridor, who are concerned legitimately about the high cost of heating oil and the awareness that there might not be adequate reserves being built up during the summer to meet the demand if there is a cold winter, they justifiably should be concerned. What we should be doing now is dropping off substantially our production of gasoline and building up reserves for heating oil. But that is not the case. Our reserves for heating oil are at an all-time low. 
   We have had consideration from the Clinton administration and some Members to set up some kind of a heating oil strategic reserve. This is rather an interesting dilemma, if you walk through it and understand it. It doesn't necessarily create the relief we want and may suggest that the Government is involving itself in the manipulation of pricing of petroleum products. 
   Let me cite an example of what I fear. Currently, the thought is that there will be an arrangement made by the Department of Energy to acquire up to 2 million barrels of heating oil reserve somewhere in the Northeast, perhaps in the New York City area, where they can lease tankage. The tradeoff on where the oil would come from would be crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in Louisiana. That oil, of course, is not refined. If we take an equivalent of 2 million barrels plus, because we want to have value for value, and take the crude oil out of SPR and refine it, we are offsetting the refining capacity of that refiner of making gasoline or perhaps heating oil with the substitution of the oil from SPR. 
   That is purchased by the Government, put in storage, and sits in storage until such time as circumstances dictate the trigger be pulled and the oil released. Then the question is, What is the appropriate triggering mechanism? Are we going to trigger the release of based on the price of heating oil, or are we going to do it as a consequence of a supply shortage? 
   Last year, we had a critical situation in the Northeast but did not actually have anyone go without heating oil. What happened last year is the reserves were very low, but there was enough to meet the demand. This year, the fear, rightly so, for many in the Northeast is that there might not be enough fuel oil to meet the demand if the winter gets cold. The dilemma is, if the Government is putting in 2 million barrels and going to basically store it, then is the industry that ordinarily would build up an inventory and tie up its cash-flow for a period of time going to do that, knowing that the Federal Government is doing the same thing? It is going to be a business decision, but it is going to be interesting to see what the private sector does. 
   It might be simply a tradeoff. Why should the private sector build up an inventory when it knows the Government has an inventory? In the end, is there any more fuel oil left for the Northeast corridor if indeed there is a cold winter? 
   I bring this out to point to the difficulty we are having in coming to grips with the reality that we have a greater demand for oil than we have of productive capability. We have become dependent again on our neighbors in OPEC--and not just the 10 official OPEC members. One of our other associates is a gentleman by the name of Saddam Hussein, who is the head of Iraq. 
   Many people forget that we fought a war over there just a decade ago. We lost 147 lives; we had 427 Americans who were wounded; we had 23 taken prisoner. Today, Iraq is the fastest growing source of oil for the United States. Isn't that rather ironic? I can't understand why Americans are not indignant over the fact that we are looking to this tyrant, who we know is selling oil, smuggling it out, generating funds for missile development--there was just an article today relative to the testing of a new missile by Iraq--developing his biological capability. This man is a bad man. He is up to no good. Yet the United States is looking to him to bail us out for our supply of oil. It is absolutely ironic that we would look to Saddam Hussein. 
   August 2 will be the 10th anniversary of Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. What a difference a decade makes. Let's do a little comparison. I think the American people should wake up and be a little sensitive to the fact that we have lifted embargoes on technologies that would allow him to increase his refining capacity. The U.N. no longer does any inspections of what is going on in Iraq or where his oil is going or whether it is going for the Food for Peace Program. 
   Ten years ago, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait to stimulate higher oil prices and to build up his war machine. We know that. That was 10 years ago. Now high oil prices yield Saddam Hussein $75 million a day under a legal U.N. oil-for-food program and $2 million a day in illegal smuggling revenue which is used to build up his war machine. 
   Mr. President, we know this for a fact. We know what he is doing with the funds he gets from smuggling oil. Ten years ago, Saddam Hussein was proved to be the biggest threat to peace in the Middle East. As of today, it has cost thousands of lives, some $10 billion of U.S. taxpayers' money, and 150,000 sorties, where we have flown to enforce our no-fly zone. It has cost the American taxpayers $10 billion to fence in Saddam Hussein. 
   Saddam Hussein is still the biggest threat to peace in the Mideast and certainly the biggest threat to Israel. I can't understand why there is not more of an awakening of the fact that we are supporting this tyrant. We are becoming more dependent upon him and we are playing into his hands. 
   Where is the logic? Where is the American foreign policy? I can simplify foreign policy with regard to Saddam Hussein and Iraq in one single syllogism. We buy his oil, we send him our dollars, we put his oil in our airplanes, and fly over and bomb him. He puts out a press release saying how many people we injured or killed, they rally around Saddam Hussein, and the process starts all over again. 
   Is this the foreign policy of the United States that we support? Or would we rather ignore it and pretend it doesn't exist? I think the latter is probably the case. It is absolutely incredible that we don't face up to what is happening and the fact that we are condoning this action. Ten years ago, Saddam Hussein was using oil revenue to purchase weapons of mass destruction. Now, Saddam Hussein--the same guy--is using his oil revenue to purchase weapons of mass destruction. We  know this. They just tested them yesterday. He has the ability, with the advanced weaponry he has developed, to extend the missile clear to Israel. 
   Ten years ago, the United States purchased less than 400,000 barrels a day from Iraq--before the war started. Now the United States is purchasing 750,000 barrels a day. Ten years ago, the United States began to import more than 50 percent of our oil, and OPEC became an important voice in U.S. energy policy. Now, the United States, as I have indicated, is importing more than 56 percent of our oil. With Iraq, the fastest-growing supplier, Saddam Hussein has become an important voice--imagine that--in our U.S. energy policy. Saddam Hussein may have lost the war, but he certainly seems to have won the peace. With its energy policy--or lack thereof--the Clinton-Gore administration has snatched defeat from the jaws of the gulf war victory. I will repeat that. Saddam Hussein may have lost the war, but he has won the peace. With its energy policy, or lack of an energy policy, the Clinton-Gore administration has snatched defeat from the jaws of the gulf victory. 
   We are very much dependent on this source, and the likelihood of reducing it is not going to take place until we send a clear message as to what our energy policy will be. Now, the alternatives aren't really very complex. We either import more and pay the price, or we commit to development and exploration of our energy resources here in the United States. Wyoming, Montana, Colorado--the overthrust belt--have a tremendous potential for oil and gas development, as does Illinois, Pennsylvania, and numerous other States. We have withdrawn about 64 percent of the public land in the United States and exempted it from exploration, let alone production. 
   Now, we have a tremendous potential in OCS areas--off the shores of Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, and other States, some of which don't want to develop OCS areas off their States. That is their own business. But for those who do they should be allowed to do so. It is kind of interesting because our Vice President made a statement in Louisiana that if he is elected President, he will make an attempt to buy back OCS oil leases and cancel other leases. 
   Mr. President, that leaves one with the question: Where is this energy going to come from? We have energy coming from my State of Alaska. We have been producing 20 to 25 percent of our 
   domestic crude oil for the last twenty years. We have the potential for a major discovery in a small sliver of the Arctic area, the Coastal Plain. Let me explain how small that sliver is. In the general area of the Arctic Wildlife Refuge, there are 19 million acres. That is as big as the size of the State of South Carolina. Half of that has been reserved in perpetuity as a wilderness. Nearly the other half has been set aside in a refuge, also in perpetuity, subject to the Congress, who are the only ones that can change it. Out of those 19 million acres, 1.5 million acres was left out to the discretion of Congress back in 1980. That was done as a consequence of the belief that this was the area where a likely discovery could be made. 
   Well, there have been a lot of estimates. When you look for oil, you never know where you are going to find it or how much you are going to find. If you are going to find it in Alaska, you better find a lot of it; otherwise, you can't afford to produce it. Recent estimates go as high as 16 billion barrels of recoverable reserves. That is based on the latest discovery and production technology, even though much of this area has not been made available for 3D seismic evaluation because it is under the Department of Interior. Sixteen billion barrels would be as much as what we would import from Saudi Arabia for a 30-year period. So it is a substantial amount. 
   What we need to do in this country--and we need to do it now; the longer we wait, the more dependent we are going to be on OPEC--is to set a clear and decisive policy toward a commitment to reduce our dependence on imports. That is what we have done, along with Senator LOTT and several colleagues, in the legislation we introduced, which is the National Energy Security Act of 2000. We have adopted a goal to guide our energy policy, and the goal is to reduce our dependence on imported oil to less than 50 percent by the end of the decade. When you have that kind of objective, you have an opportunity to send a clear message. 
   We have to send a clear message. We have to send a message to Saudi Arabia and to Kuwait, and we have to send it to Venezuela and Mexico, that we are committed to reducing our dependence and we are committed to increase exploration and production here in the United States. I admire the commitment of America's environmental community who, for the most part, oppose domestic oil production and exploration in the United States. But I remind them that we have the technology, the know-how, the American can-do spirit, and we can make the impact of development much smaller here and keep the jobs and the dollars at home, as opposed to the exploration that occurs in other areas of the world where they don't have the environmental safeguards. So what kind of a tradeoff is it? Is it better for the environment that we do it right here at home, or if we depend on those countries that don't have that internal discipline and consideration for the environment? 
   The industry says that if, indeed, they find oil in this sliver of the Arctic, out of the 1.5 million acres, which is part of the 19 million acres, which is the size of South Carolina, the footprint would be somewhere between 1,500 to 2,000 acres. My friends who are in the farming business know what kind of a farm a 1,500-acre or 2,000-acre farm is. The drilling and exploration would be done in the wintertime. The roads would be ice roads. There would be no permanent community. There would be a compatibility with the caribou. We have addressed all the issues, and we have proven it in Prudhoe Bay, where 20 percent of the crude oil has come from for the last two decades. But that was old technology; we have new technology now. Many don't want us to have an opportunity to find out if indeed the oil is there, and the oil is there in the reserves that we have. 
   Some people more or less dismiss it, and say, well, we are in a situation with oil. Don't worry. We have lots of natural gas. 
   As chairman of the Energy Committee, I have a little bit of a different view about the situation with natural gas in this country. Let me start out by reminding you and the American people that there is a rude awakening coming with regard to natural gas. It is going to affect Americans in their heating bills. It is going to affect Americans in their electric bills. 
   This is what has happened. A year ago in this country the price for natural gas was around $2.30. Six months ago, it was $2.56. Deliveries in January are $4.30. I know many utilities are going to their commissions advising them of rate increases. This hasn't hit the American public yet. If we thought the hue and cry on the increased price of heating oil or gasoline was going to bring down the roof, wait until you hear the cry of the American people this winter when they get their gas bills. 
   How did this come about? Somebody said, well, we have 160 trillion cubic feet in reserve. That was last year. We have 150 trillion cubic feet this year. We are, again, pulling down our reserves faster than we are finding new reserves. When you do that, you deplete your base. 
   What also is happening to put further pressure is the electric industry is turning to gas turbines for power generation--turbines. The permitting process is much easier and much cheaper than for building a coal-fired plant. 
   We have a situation where we are coming to grips. The American people aren't aware of it. They are not reflecting on it because it doesn't really hit them like they were hit in 1973 or 1974 when we had the Arab oil embargo. Some people in this body might be old enough to remember. We had gasoline lines around the block. The public was outraged: How could this happen in this country? How could we have these kinds of shortages? We did. The public reacted. We played the blame game and pointed the finger at everybody and everything. Gasoline and oil prices had no relief in sight. 
   I can guarantee it, natural gas has spiraled. It is escalating with no relief in sight. How did we get in this situation? One reason is we haven't had an energy policy for a long, long time.  
   What is our energy policy? Clearly, it is to provide more imports of oil into this country as opposed to developing domestic oil reserves. What is our gas policy on natural gas? We have withdrawn from public lands areas that ordinarily would be available for exploration--64 percent of the overthrust belt, as I have indicated. 
   What have we done with regard to nuclear power? Twenty percent of our power generation is nuclear energy. We can't pass a bill in this body to deal with the waste. We can't override the President's veto. We are one vote short to address what to do with our nuclear waste. There hasn't been a nuclear plant built in this country in 20 years. There is not going to be. They are building them in China. They are building them in Taiwan. They are building them in France. France is 76 percent dependent on nuclear energy. They don't have air quality problems. They are never going to be held hostage by the Mideast again. They learned that in 1973. 
   We don't have a policy on oil other than to import more. We don't have a policy for encouraging domestic gas exploration. We don't have a policy to address what we are going to do with our nuclear industry let alone resolve the nuclear waste problem. We have lots of coal. Are we building coal plants? Absolutely not. The permitting time for coal plants puts them out of reach of reality. There are none being built. 
   Tell me from where the energy is going to come. There are many who say, well, we should find alternative energy. I am all 
   for it. But you name it. 
   We have spent over $70 billion in the last two decades subsidizing the development of alternative energy. What is it? Solar, biomass, wind? Some places in my State, such as Barrow, don't get much daylight in the wintertime. It is dark all the time. Sometimes the wind doesn't blow. These alternatives are fine. They have a place. We have to encourage them. But they are not going to take the place of oil and gas in the near future. By the time we are through evaluating our alternatives, it is not a very bright picture because the alternatives just aren't there. The alternatives provide us with about 4 percent of our current energy mix. 
   We have hydro. I have not spoken of hydro. It is a renewable resource. There is no question about it. But this administration curiously enough has identified hydro as nonrenewable. I grew up in Ketchikan, AK. We have a couple hundred inches of rain a year. I remember one year we had 226 inches of rain. We have a few little hydrodams. 
   To suggest rainfall and hydro are not renewable is beyond me. But, nevertheless, the administration proposes to remove some of the dams from the Columbia and Snake Rivers to rebuild the fish runs. Unfortunately, some time ago decisions were made, rightly or wrongly, with regard to the tradeoff on posterity. It is just that simple. You are going to have your natural runs of fish. You are not going to have dams. But they trade it consciously or unconsciously for the agricultural industry associated and what dams those rivers could do with benefits in low-cost power to the residents of the area. Whether you have an aluminum plant, whether you have Boeing, whether you have tremendous agricultural productivity out of land that was once desert, they traded those things off. You can't want it both ways. You want to rebuild the natural runs. Most of the biologists will tell you that you can enhance runs by bringing in new stock, if your ability to rebuild the native runs is pretty remote. Some people suggest it is not possible. 
   But if you tear down the dams, there is another tradeoff. How much barge traffic that moves the grain and commerce up and down the Columbia and Snake Rivers is going to go back on the highways? It is all going to go back, isn't it? Somebody said there will be 700,000 more trucks on our highways, if you tear down the dams. What kind of a tradeoff is that? 
   There is no energy policy identifiable with this administration. It is that simple--no oil, no domestic exploration, no hydro, no nuclear, no coal. That is the reality of where we are. It is a pretty bleak picture.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, that is the president of OPEC. 
   The article further states:  
   Speaking to reporters on his arrival in Venezuela after a tour of OPEC countries, the Venezuelan energy and mines minister said the mechanism to trigger an increase in production depended on the OPEC oil basket price staying above $28 a barrel for 20 consecutive days.  
   Our Secretary of Energy made a deal when he was over there several months ago and petitioned the Saudis for greater production. That was at the time we were first beginning to feel the price escalation. He did generate a commitment for another 500,000 barrels of oil. 
   However, the American public and the American press made the assumption we were going to get all that increased production. We only got 16 percent. That is our allocation in this country. Mr. President, 16 percent of 500,000 barrels is not enough to fuel Washington, DC, in 1 day. It is a drop in the bucket. Other areas of the world are recovering, including Asia, Japan, and they are increasing in their demand for oil. 
   In any event, speaking to reporters, the Venezuela Energy and Mines Minister says the mechanism to trigger an increase depended on the OPEC oil basket price staying above $28 a barrel for 20 consecutive days. He further says the price of OPEC's basket of crude oil fell to $27.46 a barrel on Monday, according to the OPEC secretary in Vienna. Asked what the result from the fall in the basket price would be, Rodriguez replied: The 20-day process will begin again. 
   So we are on another 20 days; no relief for at least 20 days. They are not going to produce more oil, so the price will stay around $30, where it is currently. 
   OPEC's news agency carried a report on Monday quoting Rodriguez and other members to prepare for an output increase of 500,000 barrels a day if prices did not fall. Well, they fell. And asked whether he planned to consult with fellow OPEC members on a possible increase, Rodriguez replied that does not require consultation. He added that there is unanimous support in the cartel for an OPEC summit in Caracas in September. Remember where you heard it first. Right out of Caracas, from the president of OPEC, there is no relief in sight until September. 
   Maybe we ought to go out and fill up our tanks today because it might go up tomorrow. 
   There we are. A capsule, if you will, of the dilemma with regard to a lack of an energy policy, where we are on gasoline, where we are in heating oil, where we are in natural gas. Who bears the responsibility for this? I think it is fair to say, at times this is a partisan body of some regard, I think we have seen from time to time situations where we point the finger and don't want to bear the responsibility. 
   At the risk of generating some reaction from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I think it is fair I point out some inconsistencies with regard to the position of our Vice President. As we look at the coming election and the role of the candidate on energy and on the environment, I think we have to ask where the candidates really stand. I will give one person's view. As the campaigns march toward November, I think we have to ask ourselves where Vice President GORE really stands in the minds of the voters. I served with the Vice President in this body and I have the deepest respect for him, but I think we are aware that, while he is an expert politician, he is recognized as an extreme environmentalist to some extent. He has a mixed bag. He is involved in policy but he also appears to be a zinc miner, an oil company shareholder, and has a record of shifting his position on energy and environmental issues. 
   One looks back on gasoline prices, which I have talked a good deal about this evening, but in his book ``Earth in the Balance,'' the Vice President, who certainly structures himself as an environmentalist said: Higher taxes on fossil fuels is one of the logical first steps in changing our policies in a manner consistent with a more responsible approach to the environment. 
   ``Changing our policies'' is certainly legitimate. Even as the Vice President was casting a tie-breaking vote in this body to raise gasoline taxes--and it was his vote that raised them 4.3 cents--the Environmental Protection Agency determined that more expensive reformulated gasoline needed to be sold in many areas of the country. According to memoranda from the Department of Energy and the Congressional Research Service, EPA's gasoline requirements balkanized the market and strained supply and raised prices. 
   One has to question whether, if the Vice President's policies were so effective in raising prices, one would expect the Vice President to be somewhat satisfied. But obviously, confronted with angry consumers, AL GORE, the politician, suggested that refiners and oil companies were to blame. There is a lot of blaming around here for anything that is an inconvenience to the public. We all scurry for cover. Again, I think we have to look at whether what AL GORE wrote in his book, ``Earth in the Balance,'' suggests high energy prices would thwart the utilization of gasoline that, indeed, he might be satisfied with higher energy prices. 
   I have been handed a note relative to a matter that is of concern to all Members, and as a consequence I believe the leader is going to request the attention of this body. 
   I therefore suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I compliment my friend from Arizona for his forthright address on this very important subject that certainly needs to be resolved by this body. 
   As we continue the debate on repealing the death tax, there is a fundamental question to which we all must respond: Should the Federal Government have the right to confiscate as much as 60 percent of the assets that an individual or family business has built over a lifetime? 
   That is what this debate is all about, not the class warfare arguments we have heard from the other side, to a degree. 
   In my view, whether the estate tax is 60 percent or 40 percent or 20 percent, the estate tax is morally indefensible. It causes businesses that have been developed over a lifetime of hard work and sacrifice to be broken up just so Uncle Sam can take what some think is the Government's rightful share of that business. 
   I ask another question: Why do we have an estate tax? It may be interesting to go into the background. The reason is quite simple. Up until 1913, the Federal Government was primarily financed by tariffs. Estate taxes were periodically imposed to primarily finance wars or the threat of a war. For example, to finance the Spanish-American War, the Federal Government imposed a temporary estate tax in 1898. It was repealed in 1902. With the advent of World War I and the drop in tariff revenue, Congress adopted an estate tax with rates ranging from 1 percent to 10 percent. 
   What must be recognized about the estate taxes adopted in the 19th and early 20th centuries is the simple fact that there were no Federal income taxes to finance the Federal Government at that time. So the Government looked at estate taxes. As a result, all of the wealth that accumulated in estates had never before been taxed. 
   By contrast, when an individual dies today, his or her estate consists of assets that have been built with aftertax money. The elderly woman who dies with several hundred thousand dollars worth of Treasury notes in her estate has paid Federal income taxes every single year on those notes. The businesses that have been built up over a lifetime have paid income taxes and, in many cases, have paid corporate taxes to the Federal Government. Why, after accumulating wealth and having paid income taxes on that wealth, does the Federal Government have the right to confiscate that wealth? I do not think it has that right. 
   While I believe this is a moral question, I also look at the realities of estate planning and conclude that when confronted with an unfair and confiscatory tax system, Americans overwhelmingly reject the idea that the Government has such a right. 
   With proper estate planning, it is clear that many Americans can structure their affairs in such a way that they can entirely avoid paying any estate taxes. In fact, of the estates valued at more than $600,000, more than half, or 55 percent, paid not a single dollar in estate taxes. Of the richest Americans, those with estates valued over $20 million, nearly one-third paid no estate tax. 
   It seems to this Senator that the estate tax has become a bonanza for estate planners and tax accountants and an unfair and onerous burden to the small businesses and farmers of America who do not have the resources nor the time to take advantage of sophisticated estate planning schemes. As a result, more than 60 percent of the burden of the estate tax falls on estates valued at $5 million or less. 
   As my colleagues know, the primary asset in many of these smaller estates is the family business, whether a small retail or wholesale operation or a family farm. When it comes time to pay 
   the estate tax, many of these family businesses are forced to liquidate a portion of the business or even, in some cases, the businesses themselves; or sell the farm to basically pay the taxes. That is unconscionable especially when it has taken decades to build a business. 
   The ability to pass on the assets that have been built up over a generation to another generation is made unrealistic by the tax burden associated with the estate tax and, in the case of those who have not been fortunate enough to do estate planning, many of these people feel they have been unjustly penalized by their Government, and I agree with them. When it comes time to pay the estate tax, many of these family businesses, as I have indicated, are forced to liquidate. 
   The other option for many of these businesses is to saddle a business with a large debt to pay the tax. This only heightens the cash-flow problems that many small businesses confront as a matter of everyday activity. 
   Of course, when sophisticated estate planning is available, many of these small business estate problems would undoubtedly go away, but then we as policymakers should ask ourselves: What is the sense in constructing a tax that primarily produces a livelihood to those who can advise others on how to avoid the tax? 
   I will repeat that because I think it bears a little reflection. We as policymakers really must ask ourselves: What is the sense in constructing a tax that primarily provides a livelihood to  those who can advise others on how to avoid the tax? It is a bit ironic. 
   The time for the death tax has passed. I hope we will not see a filibuster of this measure that will help maintain the growth and development of our dynamic economy and protect the small businesses that are the backbone of our Nation. 
   Seeing no other Senator seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, throughout the rancorous campaign finance reform debate I have consistently argued that the only reasonable solution rests in increased disclosure and the active enforcement of current laws. For this reason, I voted in support of H.R. 4762--legislation requiring 527 organizations to disclose their political activities and supporters. 
   I want to unequivocally state, however, that I believe this bill is only the first step towards complete disclosure and accountability in campaign financing. Financing laws must be fair, and they must be universal. Disclosure requirements must be extended to other tax-free organizations as well, namely Internal Revenue Code 501(c) groups that have actively participated in local and national elections. 
   What is the benefit of disclosure laws if they do not apply to all? I suggest that unbalanced and incomplete restrictions will only enhance efforts to manipulate campaign financing laws. 527 groups will, essentially, be encouraged to pack up shop and re-emerge as 501(c) groups. Quickly, they will be able to continue their efforts to influence elections with limited disclosure requirements. Clearly, more reform must be done.  
   For this reason, I urge this body to move forward and extend disclosure requirements to 501(c) organizations. I doubt anyone would suggest that 501(c)(4) civic groups have not made efforts to express a political message. Earlier this year, one 501(c)(5) labor union openly professed its intention to spend tens of millions of dollars to influence House elections. And our nation's media has been awash with efforts by 501(c)(6) corporations to convey their political messages. Yet, our financing system fails to require these groups to provide expenditure and donor information. This is wrong. 
   Recently, I cast a vote that would seem to be in conflict with my support of H.R. 4762. I voted against similar language in an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization bill. It is important to note, however, that my vote was on a constitutional point of order. If the Section 527 amendment was included in the Defense bill, it would have converted the bill into a revenue measure originating in the Senate and caused the defense authorization bill to be blue-slipped--essentially killed--when it is sent to the House. This is not a matter of mere semantics, it is mandated by the Constitution. Regardless of the legislation's merits, as a senator I must uphold the Constitution. My vote reflects this duty. 
   But with H.R. 4762, the procedural obstructions were removed. I support active disclosure in our campaign financing system. By making contributions public, the American people can decide for themselves who they want to support. When issue ads from supposedly public interest groups are aired, the American public can now find out who is funding these ads. For example, we may now be able to learn whether ads for so-called environmental causes are actually being financed by members of OPEC who want to maintain their monopoly and prevent us from exploring for oil in the U.S. 
   I hope that we will soon extend the disclosure requirements to other organizations so that the American public can truly know who finances the public relations campaigns that influence our modern elections. 
   Mr. President, a word of caution is in order. I am sensitive to the legitimate needs of private citizens to criticize government without fear of retaliation. We must never forget that we are the nation of Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison. The very men who wrote under the anonymous name of ``Publius,'' shaping our government through the Federalist Papers. Would such thought and expression have survived if the cloak of anonymity was removed? Political speech is free speech, and private citizens who have not sought preferred tax status should not be limited in their rights of expression, their freedom to associate, or their right to privacy. 
   Somewhere, the proper balance between complete disclosure and the right to free expression resides. I believe H.R. 4762 is a good first step in striking this balance. Clearly, those who expect tax preferred status to advocate their political message are within the grasp of disclosure laws. I reiterate my support for full disclosure, and once again call for quick action upon more comprehensive disclosure legislation.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to offer my congratulations to the Challenger Learning Center of Alaska, its Board of Directors, and staffers, on their Official Launch Ceremony on July 7, 2000. 
   The Challenger Learning Center of Alaska will be part of the national network of 50 Learning Centers operating in the United States, Canada, and England established in memory of the 1986 Challenger Space Shuttle crew. Located in Kenai, Alaska, the Challenger Learning Center of Alaska simulates space missions to give students the opportunity to explore the endless possibilities available in science and technology fields. 
   Mr. President, currently 40 percent of America's 4th graders read below the basic level on national reading tests. On international tests, the nation's twelfth graders rank last in Advanced Physics compared with students in 18 other countries. And one-third of all  incoming college freshmen must enroll in a remedial reading, writing, or mathematics class before taking regular courses. If we are going to turn these dismal statistics around this country needs an innovative approach to teaching. The Challenger Learning Center of Alaska is working towards ensuring that our elementary and secondary students of today are the best-educated and motivated college graduates of tomorrow. 
   The Challenger Learning Center programs will not only create an environment conductive to pursuing the sciences, they will also assist students in developing skills vital to every field. In the Alaska workplace of the 21st century, survival will depend on teamwork, problem solving, communication and decision-making. Like no other educational program, the Challenger Learning Center of Alaska will help all of Alaska's students develop these critical skills while providing the solid educational content that promotes science literacy. 
   Mr. President, educators continue to site education as the number one determinate in an individual's success. I believe that the Challenger Learning Center of Alaska will profoundly affect the future of Alaska. I commend the Challenger Learning Center staff, Board of Directors, NASA and statewide communities for their tireless efforts and dedication to our young Alaskans.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is appropriate I comment on the announced position by our Vice President today on his program to lower oil imports and stabilize climate change. 
   As identified in the AP summary of June 27, under a program to ``lower oil import and stabilize climate,'' the Vice President's plan for a national energy security and environmental trust fund calls ``for diverting more than $80 billion over the next 10 years from projected Federal budget surpluses for tax incentives to drive investment in energy efficient technologies for transportation and energy use.'' 
   Notice it doesn't identify any new source of energy to relieve the shortage. 
   He proposes in a $4.2 billion program to encourage electric production from renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and $1 billion for accelerated depreciation for investments and distributed power assets. 
   But the bulk of the plan is expected to cost $68 billion over the next decade and is dedicated to what Gore calls a technology for tomorrow, a competitive program designed to provide tax relief, loans, grants, bonds, and other financial instruments for emission reduction at powerplants and industrial facilities. He doesn't mention one word about what kind of energy he proposes we are going to use. 
   He indicates we will harness that uniquely American power of innovation. Innovation will not go in your gas tank and get you home or get you on a vacation. He goes on to say: We will say to the Nation's inventors and entrepreneurs, if you invest in these new technologies, America will invest in you. 
   The Presidential candidate said: Through the power of free market, we will take a dramatic step forward for our children's health, which will also be a dramatic new step towards a stable climate. 
   It is a good deal of rhetoric and sounds pretty good. But in reading that, one would come to the conclusion that we simply have not been doing anything in the area of renewables. I point out for the RECORD, in the last 5 years this country has spent $1.5 billion for renewable energy research and development. 
   What have we done over the last two decades? We have spent $17 billion over the last 20 years in direct spending, in tax incentives for renewables. My point is, we are all supportive of renewables, but how successful have we been? We have been putting money on them. We have been providing tax incentives. 
   Our total renewable energy constitutes less than 4 percent of our total energy produced. That excludes hydro. Mr. President, 4 percent is from biomass, less than 1 percent from solar and wind. Yet most of the money in the technology has gone to solar, wind, and biomass. 
   So when the Vice President suggests a program of expenditures, some $80 billion over the next 10 years, we need relief now--the American consumer, the American motorist, the trucker. We see on our cab bills a surcharge. We see on the airplane bills a surcharge. We need relief now. 
   We have spent $1.5 billion for renewable research over the last 20 years and $17 billion in the same period in direct spending and direct incentives for renewables. My point is not to belittle renewables or their important role, but the reality is there is simply not enough. At less than 4 percent--excluding hydro--they simply are not going to provide the relief we need. 
   I think it is important we understand the Vice President's programs. While we all want to conserve energy, we want to reduce pollution, we want to reduce the Nation's dependence on foreign oil, the facts are in many cases we are not reducing the dependence on foreign oil. We are increasing. In 1973 and 1974 when we had the Arab oil embargo, we were 37-percent dependent on imported oil. Today, we are 56 percent on an average and we have gone as high as 64 percent. 
   In the Vice President's plan, I want to know how he plans to reduce the Nation's dependence on foreign oil when the Secretary of Energy is out soliciting for greater production from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico. 
   He wants to reduce the threat posed by global warming. I think that is a challenge for American technology and ingenuity. He wants to curtail brownouts by increasing electric grid reliability. What has the administration done of late in that regard? They have not worked with the Energy Committee, which I chair, on electric restructuring, which was designed specifically to address how we were going to provide an incentive for more transmission lines to be built so we could ensure that we would not have brownouts, how we were going to ensure that we would have adequate energy, whether natural gas, coal, oil, or nuclear. 
   This administration, right down the line, in its energy policy, specifically, has highlighted that it does not have an energy policy. We have seen that in our inability to prevail on high-level nuclear waste storage. We are one vote short of a veto override. 
   It is also important to go in and identify the new initiatives that the Vice President has indicated are in his policy statement. One is to ``extend incentives for natural gas exploration.'' That is actually in his statement. But let me refer to a statement our Vice President made October 22, 1999, in Rye, NH:  
   I will do everything in my power to make sure there is no new drilling--  
   No new drilling, Mr. President.  
   even in areas already leased by previous administrations.  
   I don't know how he can make that statement on October 22, 1999, and today and yesterday make the statement that he wants to extend incentives for natural gas exploration. Where is it going to come from? I certainly don't know where it is going to come from. 
   I could go on and on and identify each one of these, where there is an inconsistency. But the fact is, his program, at a cost of $75 billion to $80 billion over 10 years, supposedly from the surplus, is not going to do a single thing today to reduce gasoline prices. So what are we going to do? How are we going to relate to this? I think it is fair to say the Vice President misses the point. 
   To borrow a phrase from the Clinton administration: It is the gasoline prices, stupid. 
   We are paying more for gasoline than at any other time in our history. That is the fact. Gasoline and natural gas prices have doubled. Do you remember last March, we were paying $10, $11, $12 a barrel? Today we are paying $32 a barrel. 
   Natural gas, which is assumed to be a godsend, our relief, has gone from $2.65 per thousand cubic feet to $4.56 for deliveries in January. The American consumer has not felt this, but they will. And there will be a reaction. Wait until people start getting their gas bills around this country--not just their gas bill but their electric bill, because a good deal of the electricity is generated from gas. 
   So the Vice President wants to radically change the domestic energy industry in the future and he wants to spend $75 billion to $85 billion to do it. Think about the conventional sources of energy and the administration's position. Coal? They oppose coal. They  oppose advanced technology, clean coal, expansion of the coal mines, expansion of the generation from coal. They have already identified nine plants they propose to close and it is a dispute whether the managers of these plants have purposely extended the life of the plants or, as the management says, in order to maintain the plants to the permits they have had to do certain improvements. 
   They oppose hydro. Their proposal is to tear down the hydro dams out West. There is a tradeoff there. The tradeoff is that you put more trucks on the highway if you do away with the barge transportation system on the Columbia River. It is not just a few more trucks on the highway; it is several hundred thousand because the barges are the most effective way to move volumes of tonnage. 
   They oppose nuclear--no nuclear. They oppose oil and gas drilling, as indicated by the comments of the Vice President. 
   I think it is fair to say Vice President AL GORE is OPEC's best friend because in reality the only answer they have is to propose to import more energy. Where are we getting that energy? Saudi Arabia and another country, which I find 
   really gets my attention in the sense of being indignant. I guess I might say I am outraged. A few years ago, in 1991 and 1992, we fought a war in Iraq--Desert Storm. We lost 147 lives in that war. We had roughly 427 men and women who were wounded in that conflict. We had 23 taken prisoner. Since that time, we have enforced a no-fly zone over Iraq. That no-fly zone is an aerial blockade, if you will. It has cost the American taxpayer over $10 billion to enforce. Yet, from time to time, we launch a sortie to fly over Iraq, where they violated the no-fly zone. We drop bombs on various targets near Baghdad. This is part of our foreign policy. 
   Perhaps I can simplify this. It seems to me we buy their oil. The interesting thing is we start out with 50,000 barrels a day. Last year it was 300,000 a day. Today it is 750,000 barrels a day. We buy the oil, send Saddam Hussein the money. Then we put the oil in our airplanes and we go bomb him. 
   Maybe it is more complicated than that. There are a few people who are unfortunate victims. Saddam Hussein holds up a press release and says: The Americans and the British have killed so many Iraqi citizens. 
   That obviously rallies his people around him and the vicious circle starts again. 
   That is where we are getting our greatest single increase of oil--from Iraq, a country where it wasn't so long ago we were sacrificing lives. It is from a tyrant who obviously is using the money he is getting from the oil he smuggles to develop his missile technology and his biological warfare capability. Clearly, he is up to no good and represents a significant threat to the Mideast and Israel as well, without question. 
   Here we have an administration, a Vice President, who has no real relief in sight. He has a 10-year program costing $80 billion that is not going to provide the American consumer with any cheaper gasoline tomorrow, the next day, next week, next month, or next year. But what the Vice President proposes is designing your future but ignoring the crisis at the pump. The Vice President wants the Government to tell you what energy you are going to use and what price you are going to pay for it. That is basically what we are doing with reformulated gasoline. 
   We have refineries now customizing gasoline because the Environmental Protection Agency has mandated certain formulas in various parts of the country. I am not here to debate the merits. But the reality is, it costs money. Why does it cost money? For a lot of reasons. We have lost some of our regional refiners. We have lost 37 refiners in this country, under Clinton-GORE, two administrations, 8 years. The refineries have not been replaced. We have not had a new refinery in this country for 10 years. 
   Why? There are a lot of reasons. One is there is an inadequate return on investment. Another reason is that the permitting takes so long. The third is the potential Superfund sites; they are just not an attractive investment. So we have constricted ourselves, we have put on more regulations, and the price is being passed on to the consumer. 
   While I applaud the Vice President for recognizing that American ingenuity and technology should drive future energy demands, the reality is that unless we increase our domestic supply, we are going to continue to have shortages and higher prices. The alternatives to that are not very bright from the standpoint of any immediate relief.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. The title of the article is, ``Occidental Deal Benefits Gores.'' I don't begrudge the Gores or any families having any investment. What I do begrudge is the realization that the Vice President has lashed out and attacked big oil. I am not here to defend big oil. As chairman of the Energy Committee, we are having a hearing. We are going to invite the various oil companies and refiners to come in and explain to us why prices have gone up and what the future is likely to hold. 
   It is fair to point out Vice President AL GORE has been linking George W. Bush to big oil. I am not here to separate that, but as this article points out, the Vice President's efforts to push to privatize Elk Hills, which was a Federal oilfield in California, added a good deal--as a matter of fact, hundreds of thousands of dollars--to the Gore family estate fund. This was the Occidental Petroleum that bought Elk Hills. 
   Occidental's profits soared, and, of course, the Gore family stock in the company went from a listing of roughly $250,000 to $500,000, up to $1 million, as a consequence of the privatization of Elk Hills. Again, I do not begrudge the Vice President and his family making a fair return on an appropriate investment. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it. But those who live in glass houses should not take baths. In this case, that fits the position of the Vice President. 
   Finally, I spoke on the floor Friday about the energy crisis we are having. I talked about the Clinton-Gore energy policy, or lack of it. After I spoke, my good friend from Iowa made some observations and statements about energy policy that I think warrant some consideration. I am going to take the time, with the indulgence of the occupant of the chair, to respond. 
   We do two things in Alaska well: We harvest timber, and we harvest fish. We do not have a great deal of agriculture potential. We do some hay, potatoes, barley, and oats, but we have a short season. Fish and timber we do well. So I know something about fish and timber. I do not know much about corn. I do know quite a little bit about energy, as chairman of the Energy Committee. 
   After reading the statement of the Senator from Iowa, I think a few of his observations deserve a little closer examination. The Senator suggested our investment in ethanol production, in hydrogen, fuel cell research, and renewable energy has been minimal. He said:  
   We need to get a few million dollars in for the use of hydrogen in fuel cells and fuel cell research.  
   Again, the reference I made earlier to what we have expended speaks for itself. What we have expended in these areas is truly not insignificant. It is a major expenditure in the area of over $20 billion overall in renewables. As a consequence of that, indeed, the Senator from Iowa would agree, we have been expending a good deal in these areas of promoting renewables. 
   As a member of the Senate renewable and energy efficiency caucus, I am a supporter of ethanol production, hydrogen, fuel cell research, and renewable energy. To support hydrogen research, I moved through my committee and into law the Hydrogen Future Act which is Public Law 104-271. It was originally introduced in the House by Bob Walker and authorized the hydrogen research, development, and demonstrations programs of the Department of Energy. 
   In the nearly 5 years that have passed since that time, we have spent over $100 million on hydrogen and fuel cell research in the Department of Energy. Over the past 5 years, we have spent another $1.5 billion for renewable energy research and development, $330 million of which has gone for biomass research, including ethanol. 
   To support renewable wind energy, I have supported as a member of the Finance Committee a production tax credit for investments in wind energy. 
   To support renewable biomass energy, I have supported the repeal of the ``closed loop'' rule for the biomass energy tax credit in an effort to boost biomass energy production, including ethanol. 
   I am also a cosponsor of Senator LUGAR's biofuels research bill, S. 935, which passed this body. 
   To support the deployment of distributed renewable energy, I have worked to make Alaska a test bed for many of these technologies. Alaska has scores of small communities that are not on a consolidated electric grid. 
   We are exploring the use of wind turbines, fuel cells, and other technologies to displace the expensive diesel fuel currently used in these communities because these are the technologies that will make sense in a developing world of energy. 
   These are all areas that are very important in the effort to decrease our imports of foreign energy and protect our environment, and I do support them personally, as well as in my position as chairman of the Energy Committee. 
   Senator HARKIN's contention that we ``need to get a few million dollars'' for research in these areas suggests we are not making these investments when, in fact, we are. I did not want any of my colleagues or America to be misled. 
   Talking about gasoline prices again, Senator HARKIN also encouraged me, as chairman of the Energy Committee, to subpoena oil company executives, to put them before my committee and start asking the ``tough questions'' in an effort to get to the bottom of the high prices. 
   Indeed, my staff and I had already been planning and have planned a hearing on gasoline prices to include representatives from the industry and the administration. We made that decision several days ago. That hearing, as announced, will be held on Thursday, July 13, at 9:30 a.m. 
   At that time, we plan to explore issues of gasoline supply problems and ask if deliverability, transportation, refining, and blending resources are adequate to supply our near-term and long-term gasoline needs. It is a matter of supply and demand. The supply is down, the demand is up. 
   But it may interest my friend from Iowa to know that subpoenas are unlikely to be necessary for the oil companies or their representatives. When our committee asks them to appear, they appear. They answer the questions asked of them, and I am not anticipating any problem with the oil companies responding to our questions. 
   On the other hand, I think you would agree, sometimes we do have problems with the administration. Secretary Richardson recently found it inconvenient to appear before our committee on the Los Alamos matter. So there is some doubt he will show up to answer, as Senator HARKIN puts it, the tough questions. 
   We are considering asking the EPA Administrator, who is responsible pretty much for the reformulation of gasoline around the country, where the refineries are now customizing, and that would be EPA Administrator Carol Browner. There is some question she will appear. She may be worried the reformulated gasoline requirements have, in fact, balkanized the market and driven prices up. That might make her inclined not to attend. 
   While the Senator from Iowa said in his remarks Friday that reformulated gasolines were ``not the problem,'' I am personally not so sure of that. Consider the following facts: Under the Environmental Protection Agency regulations, fuel made for consumption in Oregon is not suitable for California's consumption. Fuel made for distribution in western Maryland cannot be sold in Baltimore. Areas such as Chicago and Detroit are islands in the fuel system, requiring special ``designer'' gasolines. Gasoline sold in Springfield cannot be sold in Chicago.  
   A recent Energy Information Agency report observed that an eastern U.S. pipeline operator handles 38 different grades of gasoline, 7 grades of kerosene, and 16 grades of home heating oil and diesel fuel. 
   Between Chicago and St. Louis, a 300-mile distance--think of this--four different grades of gasoline are required. Is that necessary? I am not here to debate that point, but I am here to tell you that it all costs money and the consumer pays for it. It is estimated that reformulated gasoline costs an average of 50 cents more a gallon for the reasons I have outlined. 
   The predictable result is refiners lack the flexibility to move supplies around the country to respond to local or regional shortages. Again, I advise the President that 37 refineries have closed. No new ones have opened. Why? I think the answer is obvious. 
   These are among the questions we will explore in our hearing, and I hope we will have good cooperation from the industry and good cooperation from the Clinton-Gore administration. 
   There are a few things we do know before the hearing. 
   Even before we convene the hearing, here is what we already know. Americans are now paying more for their gasoline than at any other time in history. Our dependency on foreign oil is at an all-time high--higher than any other time in history. 
   Again, we fought a war 9 years ago over threats to our oil supply. I have indicated the loss of life we have had, the prisoners who were taken, and those who were wounded. 
   Further, domestic oil production is down 17 percent since the start of the Clinton-Gore administration. 
   I think it is important for Members to recognize we have a little history to indicate why we are in this predicament. 
   We will almost assuredly have brownouts this summer when energy usage exceeds energy supply. That is because the Clinton-Gore administration has actively curtailed domestic energy production in all forms in virtually all areas of this country. 
   For 8 years, President Clinton and Vice President GORE have been warned that our foreign oil consumption was increasing and our domestic oil production was decreasing. One can only assume they chose to ignore the warnings, and now we have record prices for gas and home heating oil. 
   This is a problem of leadership. Both the President and the Vice President and my good friend, Senator HARKIN from Iowa in a speech, suggested that the oil companies are to blame. It is the blame game played around Washington, DC, all the time. And maybe the oil companies are partially responsible. I am not ruling that out. 
   But leadership is not assessing blame. Leadership is about preventing the crisis before it happens. Sadly, the crisis is here, and Americans are paying the price. Perhaps even worse, the most powerful Nation on Earth--the most powerful Nation in the history of the world--is at the mercy of a handful of oil-producing nations because we are not producing our own domestic resources. 
   Where would we get them? We have the Rocky Mountain overthrust belt all around Wyoming, Montana, New Mexico, and other areas. We have the OCS off the Gulf of Mexico, Texas, Alabama, and Mississippi, and my State of Alaska. We have the resources here. There is absolutely no question about it. We have the technology. We also have an administration that would much rather send the Secretary of Energy overseas to beg for increased production from OPEC and from Saddam Hussein than generate domestic oil production here at home where we are assured we would have a continued supply. We could keep the jobs here and the dollars here. 
   If we were willing to fight for oil supply in the Persian Gulf, we ought to be willing to drill for it domestically here in the United States. 
   I talked about what the Vice President has said about this. I have noted the Vice President's sudden interest, as expressed on his campaign trail, about the prices paid by gasoline consumers, and again, his suggestions that the oil companies are to blame. 
   Surely this cannot be the same Vice President GORE who cast the tiebreaking vote for higher gasoline taxes in this Senate body. 
   Surely this is not the same Vice President who wrote in his book, ``Earth in the Balance,'' that: ``Higher taxes on fossil fuels ..... is one of the logical first steps in changing our policies in a manner consistent with a more responsible approach to the environment.'' 
   Perhaps the Vice President doesn't have to buy gas as the rest of us, but someone needs to tell him that raising taxes on gasoline only hurts hard-working Americans. 
   In summary, to conclude, I think the energy policy of the Clinton-Gore administration can be summed up in a single word. That word is ``no''--no domestic oil exploration or production, no use of coal, no use of nuclear power, no use of hydroelectric power, no to increasing supplies of natural gas, and no to new oil refineries. 
   We have a better idea; that is, the National Energy Security Act of 2000, introduced by Senator LOTT, myself, and others because it encourages domestic production, energy efficiency, renewable energy, and other energy resources, with the goal of decreasing our oil imports to a level below 50 percent. 
   We have a goal in our energy policy, in our Republican plan. Ask the Clinton-Gore administration what their energy policy is, what their goal is. As I see it, it is an $80 billion expenditure on renewables coming about in 10 years, when today, if you exclude hydro, only 4 percent of our energy comes from renewables. I wish there were more. 
   Anyway, this is the kind of balanced approach that I think will keep energy supplies stable and affordable for America. I urge my colleagues to support the National Energy Security Act of 2000, which was raised here on the floor the other day and the leader assures me is pending. 
   I thank the occupant of the chair and the clerks for prevailing at this late hour. I have been asked to close the Senate today. So with their indulgence, I will proceed. My reason for keeping you here tonight, obviously so late, is the inability to get floor time in morning business because of the accelerated schedule. So I hope you will understand.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am joined by Senator CAMPBELL and Senator ABRAHAM today in introducing legislation that will ease the burden that the American motorist is facing every time he or she fills up at the gas pump. Those of us who are going to the gas pumps lately know that we are starting to see gas prices at an all-time high. We have never had gas prices approaching $1.75, which is the standard price for regular gasoline in the United States today. 
   Our legislation recognizes that many consumers are facing a gasoline emergency. They use their cars to get to work, drive to day care, and take their children to summer school. Suddenly they are finding that filling up the family car's gas tank is costing $50 to $70 or even $100 in some parts of the country. And in an America where the Clinton-Gore administration has done its best for seven years to increase America's dependence on OPEC, the American public was lulled by the Administration into believing that gas prices would always remain stable and cheap. The result: Nearly 50 percent of all vehicles sold are low-mileage sport utility vehicles (SUVs). 
   Earlier this year, I co-sponsored legislation that would have temporarily repealed the 4.3 cent gas tax increase that was enacted in 1993 with Vice President AL GORE's tie-breaking vote. Many Senators expressed concern that a temporary repeal of the tax would affect the highway construction program. Although our legislation resolved that problem, all Democrats and a few Republicans rejected providing gas tax relief and the measure was defeated. 
   This is a new concept in one sense. But it does not establish a precedent. The bill I am introducing is to temporarily reduce the burden of all gasoline taxes on the American motorist. The bill will allow individuals and families to take an above-the-line deduction on their income that they pay taxes on for gasoline taxes incurred between July 1 and December 31 of the year 2000. This means every taxpayer who drives will be able to take advantage of the tax deduction from his or her income tax. 
   The deduction of gasoline taxes is not a new idea. Up until 1978, motorists could deduct the State and local gasoline taxes if they itemized those taxes.  Legislation I have introduced today goes a step further by also permitting the deduction of Federal gasoline taxes, and it is an inclusive tax deduction since it will allow itemizers and nonitemizers to claim these taxes. 
   For example, if we adopt this measure, and a family in my State of Alaska has a car that gets 20 miles per gallon and they drive perhaps 9,000 miles in the next 6 months, they will get a $118 tax deduction; the same family in Michigan will get a $195 tax deduction; a family in Colorado will receive a $181 tax deduction. 
   Some detractors say citizens will have to itemize returns. Most people go to self-service gas stations where a receipt is provided. I think most Americans would welcome this $195 or $181 tax deduction. I don't think it is too much to ask motorists.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the average national price of unleaded regular gasoline is anywhere from $1.70 to $1.80 today. This weekend begins the summer driving season. Gasoline prices could well go above $2 a gallon in many parts of the country. As we know, they are already over $2.30 in Chicago, Milwaukee, and other areas. 
   Our proposal is a modest attempt to help the American family cope with these extraordinary price rises. This isn't going to solve the problem of high gasoline prices. We could have solved that problem 5 or 6 years ago if we would have adopted the 1995 budget which permitted drilling in America's most promising new oil area, the sliver of the Arctic Coastal Plain, but President Clinton vetoed that bill, surely with the concurrence of Vice President GORE. So today we are dependent as never before on imported oil. The result is the record gasoline prices.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor today to offer my congratulations and thanks to my Chief of Staff, David Kline Garman, who has dedicated his entire life to public service. Today, in fact, marks the 20th anniversary of David's service in the United States Senate. 
   David's public service career began even before he came to the Senate. While attending Duke University in the 1970s, he participated in Naval ROTC and during the summer of 1976 he served with the naval amphibious task force which rescued American Nationals from Beirut during the Civil War in Lebanon. 
   After graduating with Honors from Duke in 1979, he served in the Peace Corps working on rural water supply projects in Nepal. He came to the Senate on June 23, 1980 to work as an intern with Senator Richard Dick'' Stone (D-Florida), beginning in the Senator's mail room and working his way up to assist on defense, finance, banking and energy issues. 
   After David attended the Democratic Convention in 1980, he began to reconsider his political affiliation and on the day Ronald Reagan was inaugurated in 1981, David joined my staff to serve as Legislative Aide on defense and foreign relations. He was soon promoted to Legislative Assistant for energy and natural resources. 
   In addition to his legislative expertise, David is extremely knowledgeable in the nuts and bolts of high technology. In the late 1980s he became Founding Coordinator for the U.S. Senate Microcomputer Users Group. This group was instrumental in changing Senate technology policy so that each office could decide what type of computer system it would utilize. Previously, Senate offices could only use a system selected by the Senate Computer Center. 
   David's broad range of intellectual interests led me to select him to join the staff of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence when I was a Member of the Committee. 
   He played a key role in the development of ``environmental intelligence'' capabilities in the intelligence community and at the national laboratories. 
   Some of David's best work occurred when he joined the staff of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He was responsible for environmental issues, including the Clean Air Act, Global Climate Change Policy, energy R&D and Arctic Research, Science and Technology policy. 
   While David worked incredibly long hours on highly technical policy issues at the Energy Committee, he went to school at night and in 1997 earned a Master of Science in Environmental Sciences at Johns Hopkins University. That I consider a very noteworthy achievement. 
   Despite his many hours of work and study, David did find the time to meet a beautiful woman, Kira Finkler, and her lovely daughter Bonnie. Kira, who works on the Minority staff of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee did not allow energy policy differences to stand in the way of their relationsip. They were married in December of 1998. 
   By this time, I had asked David to move from the Energy Committee and become my Chief of Staff. And as all Senators know, this is about the hardest job there is in a Senate office, because it is the Chief of Staff who has to get the trains to run on time. David does a superb job and I am deeply  grateful to him for how well he does his job. 
   I encourage his friends to join me in celebrating and recognizing this 20th anniversary. 
   As anyone can tell, David is a highly versatile and intelligent person who can handle almost any responsibility given to him. There are few people I know who are as capable as David. In addition to all of his substantive knowledge, David is a superb, outstanding speech writer, although he didn't write this speech. Some of the best speeches I have given were written by David. 
   Mr. President, there is a huge turnover of the staff on Capitol Hill. That reflects the long hours, modest pay and economically rewarding opportunities available in Washington's private sector. It is rare to find such an incredibly dedicated public policy servant as David Garman and I salute him today for 20 extraordinary years of service in the Senate and to the American people.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to talk a little bit about a topic that is in the newspapers today and that has been all week; that is, the crisis concerning energy and our gasoline price structure currently prevalent throughout the country. 
   I think it is fair to go back and evaluate what has happened over the last 8 years in the Clinton/Gore administration. 
   I think it is obvious to all that the answer to our energy shortage by the Clinton administration is pretty much to put our economic destiny in the hands of the foreign oil price-fixing cartel because their answer to the shortage has been to increase oil imports and decrease domestic production. 
   The first time we saw this crisis coming was a few months ago. The reaction of the administration was to send the Secretary of Energy, Secretary Richardson, almost with a tin cup, to beg OPEC to increase their oil production. That was the answer. 
   The success of that effort is somewhat limited when you recognize that there is more pressure throughout the world to utilize oil. A consequence of that, of course, is the realization that the Asian economy is coming back, which is putting more pressure for oil in that part of the world. We found our reserves substantially lower as a consequence of the cold winter and an inadequate supply of heating oil. While we had this situation developing, it was quite evident what was going to happen behind the supply and demand curve. The demand was greater than the supply. We were pulling down our reserves faster than we were replacing them. 
   It is kind of interesting to see the ``blame game'' that is going on in Washington. 
   The administration is blaming the price increase on the oil companies, and on the refiners--on anyone but themselves; on anyone other than recognizing that the Clinton/Gore administration has not really had an energy policy that has been identifiable. 
   The first graphic explanation is going back to a time a few years ago when the Vice President came to the Chamber and broke a tie vote to establish a 4.3 cent-per-gallon gas tax. That, I think, can certainly be reflected on as the ``Gore gas tax.'' 
   Following that, we saw a series of activities by the administration that hardly would relieve the coming shortage that was evident, even at that time. 
   The administration has taken vast areas of the Rocky Mountain overthrust belt off limits to energy exploration. These are areas where there is a high potential for oil and gas discoveries--Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana. And other States were simply taken off limits. It is estimated that 64 percent of those areas have been removed. 
   There are areas in the Continental Shelf that they put off limits to energy exploration. 
   Furthermore, the Vice President, in a statement made in Louisiana, stated that if he were elected President, he would pursue a policy of no more leases if anyone even attempted to thwart existing leases that have been issued. 
   During that timeframe, the administration vetoed legislation to open up the small sliver of the Arctic Coastal Plain where reserves had been estimated as high as 16 billion barrels. That is just in my State of Alaska. It is estimated that if indeed the potential reserves were there, it would 
   replace our current imports from Saudi Arabia over a period of 30 years. 
   Further, the administration has put domestic energy reserves off limits through a unilateral designation of new national monuments under the Antiquities Act. 
   It is a pretty simple equation. Domestic production is down 17 percent, and imports are up 14 percent. 
   We talk about rising gasoline prices in various areas of the country. We have talked about the refineries, and why they can't address this and continue with an uninterrupted supply at a relatively low price. 
   What the administration doesn't tell you is the reality--that the Environmental Protection Agency, through mandates, has caused a significant increase associated with the mandate for reformulated gasoline. 
   Who pays the price associated for this reformulated gasoline? 
   Why is it so high? 
   It is kind of interesting. When you go through the State of Illinois and the State of Wisconsin, you are made aware that as of June 1 there was a mandate by the Environmental Protection Agency that reformulated gasoline containing ethanol replacing MTBE be established. That costs roughly 50 cents more a gallon. You cannot use the same gasoline in Springfield, IL, that you would use in Chicago, IL, because of the policies of the EPA. 
   I am not going to debate the merits of the regulation. But I will debate the reality that these regulations cost money because they require customizing, if you will, of the gasoline and the refining process. 
   It is kind of interesting to also note that we have lost 36 refineries in this country in the last decade. They haven't built a new refinery in almost 25 years. Why not? Obviously, it is not a very attractive business to get into, or the oil companies would be moving into it. They are moving out of them. The reason: It takes decades; in some cases not that long, but several years to get permits. The permitting process is legitimate. But if you can't basically get there from here, you are going to have very little interest in pursuing refineries. 
   I think it is fair to say that the administration's overzealous policies are responsible for closing some 36 regional refineries. The fact that no new ones have opened during the 8 years under the Clinton/Gore administration is a valid, understandable, legitimate reason as to why we are seeing gasoline prices in regional areas mandated by new policies from EPA prevail. 
   The Vice President can try to shift the blame to the oil companies for higher prices, but let's not forget that he personally cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate for higher gasoline prices. 
   To attempt to counteract that, we have a firm policy that is introduced in legislation which is the Republican energy production proposal for the year 2000. We recognize what has happened in this country. Today, the average price of gasoline is $1.68 per gallon. In the Midwest, the average is $1.87. The only way to address this responsibly is through a series of incentives that not only stimulate domestic production by opening up the overthrust belt, by opening up areas in the coastal OCS area, opening up areas in the arctic where we are likely to find significant discoveries, but have a goal in the legislation. The goal is to reduce dependence upon imports to less than 50 percent in a 10-year period of time. In the Vice President's book ``Earth in the Balance,'' on page 73, he identifies ``higher taxes on fossil fuels ..... is one of the logical first steps in changing our policy in a manner consistent with a more responsible approach to the environment''; that is, taxing higher fuels to discourage people from using fuels. 
   He further says it ought to be possible to establish a coordinated global program to accomplish the strategic goal of completely eliminating the internal combustion engine over, say, a 25-year period. The implications of that, of the Vice President encouraging high costs to address perhaps the elimination of the internal combustion engine, or his belief, if indeed it is his belief, that higher taxes on fossil fuel is  one of the first steps in changing our policies, certainly is occurring. 
   However, let's be realistic and recognize in this country our transportation system depends on oil. Don't expect modest OPEC increases to bring prices down at the pump. As we have seen in this last announcement by an increase in OPEC of 700,000 barrels a day, the market sophistication has already made a judgment. The judgment is that prices are going to continue to rise. Right after this announcement, west Texas medium crude rose 72 cents Wednesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up an additional 28 cents by the afternoon, where contracts for August delivery were $31.65 a barrel. Last year at this time, oil was selling for about $12 to $14 a barrel. 
   If there are those who were misled by the assumption that energy was going to substantially be increased by this OPEC announcement, remember that 700,000 barrels a day does not come to the United States alone. Our share of that is 15 percent. That is only 109,000 barrels a day. In the District of Columbia, we consume 121,000 barrels a day, to give a comparison. The last OPEC production increase in March, which was to produce a 1.7 million-barrel increase, may have yielded roughly 500,000 barrels due to cheating on production overquota. 
   As we look to the future, it is amusing to recognize that the administration has now come out with what it referred to as a detailed blueprint for congressional action. Mind you, they are asking, now, for congressional action. The President has called on Congress to pass a proposal to encourage more stripper well production. 
   First, we don't have a proposal. There is no legislation 
   set up. We have in the Republican package, a proposal to increase stripper well production. But now the President is saying we need to get some of these American wells back in operation. 
   Where has he been? We have been trying to encourage the administration to support legislation that would put in place a foreign ceiling. They have not proposed any. And now he is saying he has a program. Where is it, Mr. President? He says we need to get some of these things back in operation. 
   He further states that Congress is not reauthorizing Strategic Petroleum Reserve. He went into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve the other day as a consequence of an accident on the Mississippi River to keep refinery production going. He didn't ask us for authority. He has the authority. He knows he has the authority. This is another smokescreen. 
   We look at his concern over the supply in the Northeast corridor this coming winter. What has he done about the supply to increase it? Absolutely nothing. He has no plan, no proposal, no increased production. The President or the Vice President or his advisers simply do not understand the reality that this is a supply and demand issue. Unless we increase the supply, we are going to have shortages. That is evident by what we are seeing in the paper. We have $2.33, $2.40, and $2.49 a gallon for gasoline in this country. This particular headline suggests that the gas price rise shakes Democrats. The reason it shakes the Democrats, and the reason this is a partisan issue, is because the Democrats and the administration simply have no plan and have not had a plan associated with the energy shortage that is occurring in this country today. 
   As I come to the Senate floor today to address this matter and reflect on how we are going to correct it, the simple response is that we are going to have to increase our supplies, and we will have to do it dramatically and in a timely manner. If we don't do that, we are going to continue to see an increase in the price of oil, and an increased dependence on imports. One of the frustrating things about the continued dependence on imports is from where those imports are coming. 
   Last year, we imported about 300,000 barrels of crude oil from Iraq. This year we are importing about 750,000 barrels from Iraq. A lot of people perhaps have forgotten we fought a war over there in 1991 and 1992. We lost 147 lives. We had roughly 427 wounded, 23 were taken prisoner. 
   Today, what we are doing, and this is where I am critical of our foreign policy, for all practical purposes, we are buying his oil, sending him our dollars, taking his oil, putting it in our airplanes, and going over and bombing. What kind of a foreign policy is that? It is just about that simple. Not very complex. 
   He is making a press release every time we bomb saying, here is how many people Americans killed in my country. He waves that around and generates more support. The dollars we are paying go to the Republican Guards for his safety and protection. And he is smuggling oil out, in addition to that which is under the auspices of the United Nations. What is he doing with the generation of funds from the smuggling of the oil? He is building up his arsenal, his capability with missiles, his capability with the biological weaponry. Here is a very bad man out there. And we are supporting his regime because we are becoming more dependent on him as a source of oil. 
   What does that do to strengthening stability in the Middle East? It is pretty hard to say, but it certainly represents a threat against Israel. It is well known, the disposition of Iraq and Saddam Hussein relative to the threat against Israel and the peace we all hope will come to the Middle East. 
   I could go on at great length. I see other Senators desiring to discuss various matters. It is my intention as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to put together in this next week a chronology of certain portions of our negative exposure, if you will. One is on gasoline prices, one is on refinery operations, one is on the availability and continued uninterrupted supply of natural gas. 
   The other is the delivery system within our electric power industry and our transmission grids. It is appropriate we start preparing ourselves for a train wreck that is going to come. We are seeing it in gasoline prices as a consequence of shortage of crude oil. We are going to see it spread, as we see in the northeastern part of the Nation which is so dependent on oil for the generation of electricity, as the summer warms up. 
   Last year they were paying $10 and $11 a barrel for oil. This year they are going to be paying over $30. The electrical rates in the Northeast corridor are going to go up dramatically. They thought they had higher rates for fuel oil last year. They have not seen anything yet. We are going to have brownouts this year because the capacity of the transmission lines, for all practical purposes, is just about at their maximum in certain areas. 
   Why haven't we built more transmission lines? FERC has been sitting for 3 years on a rate case, a rate case that is going to make a determination of whether or not it is financially beneficial for the investment in transmission lines in the sense they can recover their investment. 
   What about natural gas? The electric industry is moving into the area more and more and converting to natural gas, but while the supply of natural gas is abundant, we are now pulling down our reserves. Last year, our reserves were about 160 trillion cubic feet; this year, they are about 150. We are using more gas than we are finding. We are using currently about 20 trillion cubic feet. The estimate is about 30 to 35 in the next 10 years. We are not finding a replacement. So we are going to have a crunch in natural gas, and natural gas is going to go up. 
   It is estimated the industry is going to have to spend $1.5 trillion to put in new infrastructure for delivery into various parts of the country. From where is the capital going to come? It is only going to come if they get an adequate return on their investment; otherwise, they are not going to build the pipelines. 
   This whole thing is coming to a head. The American people are beginning to wake up a little bit. The administration is beginning to point the blame to industry, to Congress, to the refiners, to anybody but themselves, because this administration has not had an energy policy of any consequence, as evidenced by the President's statement that suddenly he is concerned and suddenly he sends something to Congress--if we can identify just what this is he sent up--calling on Congress to pass a variety of administrative proposals. They do not say what the proposals are. He is a little late. It is like somebody fiddling while Rome burned.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor today to congratulate three exceptional teachers in Alaska--Douglas Heetderks of Anchorage, Lura Hegg of Palmer, and Gretchen Murphy of Fairbanks. President Clinton named these Alaskans as recipients of the 1999 Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching. This is our Nation's highest honor for mathematics and science teachers in grades K through 12. 
   Each year, a national panel of distinguished scientists, mathematicians and educators recommends one elementary and one secondary math teacher and one elementary and one secondary science teacher from each state or territory to receive a presidential award. The 1999 recipients were selected from among 650 finalists. 
   The Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching Program is administered by the National Science Foundation (NSF) on behalf of the White House. The program was established in 1983 and is designed to recognize and reward outstanding teachers. In addition to a presidential citation and a trip to Washington, DC, each recipient's school receives a NSF grant of $7,500 to be used under the direction of the teacher, to supplement other resources for improving science or mathematics programs in their school system. 
   Douglas Heetderks, Lura Hegg and Gretchen Murphy are exceptional and highly dedicated teachers. Douglas Heetderks teaches Elementary Science at Susitna Elementary in Anchorage; Lura Hegg teaches Secondary Science at Colony Middle School in Palmer; and Gretchen Murphy teaches Elementary Math at University Park Elementary School in Fairbanks. In addition to having extensive knowledge of math and science, they have demonstrated an understanding of how students learn and have the ability to engage students, foster curiosity and generate excitement. Mr. Heetderks, Ms. Hegg, and Ms. Murphy have displayed an experimental and innovative attitude in their approach to teaching and are highly respected for their leadership. 
   Mr. President, our nation's future depends on today's teachers. Currently, 40 percent of America's 4th graders read below the basic level on national reading tests. On international tests, the nation's 12th graders rank last in Advanced Physics compared with students in 18 other countries. And one-third of all incoming college freshmen must enroll in a remedial reading, writing, or mathematics class before taking regular courses. 
   If we are to turn these dismal statistics around we are going to need more and talented teachers like Mr. Heetderks, Ms. Hegg and Ms. Murphy. I applaud them for their hard work and dedication to our children. They are educating those who will lead this country in creating, developing, and putting to work new ideas and technology.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the National Hockey League's Rookie of the Year, Scott Gomez of the Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils. Scott was born and raised in Anchorage, Alaska and is only the eighteenth Alaskan to play in the National Hockey League and the first to make such a huge impact in his first year. 
   This past Thursday, Scott was awarded the Calder Trophy for best rookie performance in the 1999-2000 season. He led all rookies with 19 goals and 51 assists in 82 regular season games. During the playoffs, he earned 10 points. Past winners of the Calder include Bobby Orr and Ray Bourque. 
   Scott Gomez is an amazing young man. At the age of only 20, he has accomplished his lifelong dream of playing in the National Hockey League and winning the Stanley Cup, all in one year. He was a rising star in Anchorage where he began playing as a child. From very early on, it was evident that he would be a big star in the NHL. He was twice named Player of the Year by the Anchorage Daily News/State Coaches. In his junior year of high school, he led the Alaska All-Stars team, ages 16-17, to the USA Hockey Tier I national championship. After graduating from East High School in Anchorage, Scott played for Team USA in the World Junior Championship. In addition to this, he is the first Latino to play in the NHL. His father, Carlos, is Mexican and his mother, Dalia, is Colombian. 
   Mr. President, Scott Gomez is a wonderful example of a young, talented Alaskan who, I am sure, will continue to impress us all in the years to come.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr President, I rise today to commend a helicopter crew from the Coast Guard Air Station in Sitka, Alaska. These four brave men rescued three fishermen from a fierce storm at sea last November. Pilot Lt. Robert Yerex, co-pilot Lt. James O'Keefe, and Petty Officers Third Class Christian Blanco and Noel Hutton flew their helicopter into 40- to 60-knot winds and pulled three fishermen from 35- to 40-foot high swells. The Coast Guard awarded this intrepid crew the Distinguished Flying Cross, the highest peace time honor that can be awarded, earlier this month. 
   On November 12, 1999, the four-member crew of the Becca Dawn was caught in a storm 160 miles southwest of Sitka, on the coast of Southeast Alaska. The storm caused the 52-foot vessel to begin sinking so quickly the crew had no time to radio a mayday. Instead, an emergency position-indicating radio beacon was triggered. The signal from the beacon was picked up by the Coast Guard and the helicopter crew was immediately sent out. When they arrived, they found the fishermen had already abandoned ship. 
   The storm made the rescue extremely difficult. The gusting winds made it extremely difficult to maintain the helicopter's stability, and blowing snow made visibility extremely low. 
   Once the Coast Guard crew arrived on the scene they pulled up three of the four crew members. This operation took thirty minutes. With winds gusting to 60 knots, the crew of the bucking helicopter became nauseous, but persevered in their search for the missing fourth fisherman in the cold, turbulent water. They only returned to land at the last moment, almost out of fuel, when staying longer would have made them into casualties themselves. Unfortunately, the fourth fisherman was never found and is presumed lost at sea. 
   Obviously, this brand of courage and tenacity is worthy of the Distinguished Flying Cross and I am very proud of my fellow Coast Guardsmen and Alaskans and I congratulate their hard work and dedication. All Coast Guardsmen pride themselves on being ``always ready,'' and these four courageous rescuers showed just what that spirit is all about. I salute them.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is with great honor today that I rise to recognize one of the finest men in the Alaska Army National Guard, Sergeant Edwin D. Irizarry. Sergeant Irizarry's hard work and dedication to the Army National Guard in Alaska have earned him the title of the ``Noncommissioned Officer of the Year.'' Mr. President, this is no small award. It is only awarded to those who show outstanding leadership and extraordinary accomplishments in their duty. Sergeant Irizarry epitomizes the commitment and unselfish honor of the men and women in Alaska's Army National Guard. 
   This is a great honor for Alaska. The commitment to be in the Guard requires an individual to work hard and sacrifice their own personal time to protect the very communities where they live. Sergeant Irizarry lives and works in Ketchikan, with his wife and family. Ketchikan is a beautiful town in southeast Alaska where I was fortunate to have been raised. I know the terrain that the Guard uses is no walk in the park. Mountains and a channel of water hug the town in this great place. To be stationed in Ketchikan one must learn to adapt to the fast changing climate and diverse environment that exists in this region. Ketchikan and Alaska are truly indebted to the many fine soldiers like Sergeant Irizarry who protect and assist in communities throughout the last frontier. 
   Sergeant Irizarry serves as role model and inspiration to the over 300,000 men and women in our country's National Guard. Without the talent and support given to our armed forces by the National Guard and individuals like Sergeant Irizarry, our country would not be where it is today. I take great pride in congratulating Sergeant Irizarry for his Guard career and for being an example for all of us to follow.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to alert my colleagues of the growing concern that we all have relative to climate change and the developing technology associated with that change. 
   This week the U.S. Global Change Research Program issued a revealing and rather startling new report on the consequences of climate change. This report affects a number of things. But the most significant portion of the report is the estimated effects of climate change on various regions of the country and various sectors of our economy. It is very important--agriculture, water resources, and so forth. 
   At the heart of this report are some ``potential scenarios'' of climate change over the next 100 years predicted by two climate models: Computers models that were state of the art 3 years ago when the report began. These ``scenarios'' of climate change were then used to drive other models for vegetation, river flow, and agriculture. Each of these models had its own set of assumptions and limitations. The end result was a 600-page report that paints a rather grim picture of 21st century climate predictions.  
   Some in the environmental community in favor of the Kyoto Protocol are now using this report and shouting from the rooftops. They think this study means we should go forward with drastic measures to limit greenhouse gases. 
   But I want to caution my colleagues to look beyond the rhetoric and to look to the science that underlies this assessment. What they are going to find is rather startling. The realization factually is that we are only just now beginning to conduct the kind of scientific research that will allow us to determine impacts of climate change. 
   My point is obvious. These models were based on technology 3 years ago. Technologies change. Interpretations change. But the basis for the evaluation and generalization is based on old information. 
   For example, a reasonable test of a climate model is whether or not it actually and accurately stimulates today's climate. The fact is that it doesn't. We found from the National Assessment's own science web site a comparison of rainfall predicted by two climate models that measure actual rainfall. The area reflects twice what the model predicts. More than twice as much rainfall is actually observed as opposed to what the model suggests. 
   The emotional concern is coming from the model. Where you actually get 10 inches of rain, the model predicts that you actually get 20 inches, or more. Similarly, in the areas where the model predicts less than half as much rainfall as is actually observed, you actually get 10 inches of rain. The model predicts that you would get 5, or less. 
   So the model is absolutely under question and under scrutiny and doesn't represent reality. 
   The amount of rain or snow falling within a river basin determines the river flow. We all know that determines the amount of water for irrigation of crops, the health of fish species, the generation of hydroelectric power, and the water available for human use. 
   Depending on what the climate models say, you can imagine some very different impacts because the models are off by 50 or 100 percent in either direction. You can see it is going to change. The estimate of impacts from climate change on these sensitive areas could also change. 
   Even with all of this, the assessment has been a very useful exercise because it shows the difficulty of estimating regional impacts of climate change. It highlights the need for additional scientific research; namely, improved climate models; 
   and it reminds us of the potential risk of climate change. 
   For just a moment I want to shift the talk about how our energy policy will determine future emissions of greenhouse gases. As you might imagine, further emissions will be extremely sensitive in the energy choices we make. We now have an excellent opportunity to address our environmental concerns at the same time that we address our growing dependence on foreign oil. 
   Yesterday, we conducted a hearing on the Republican energy strategy in S. 2557, the National Energy Security Act of 2000. It includes a balanced portfolio of energy options that, amazingly enough, would produce fewer greenhouse gases than the current administration plan. Let me repeat that. This legislation contains a methodology to generate fewer greenhouse gases than the administration's current energy plan. That is not surprising because the administration's plan would increase our dependence on foreign oil to nearly 66 percent by the year 2020. 
   We would advocate increased use of natural gas for a wide range of energy needs. We also provide tax incentives for renewables, such as wind and biomass, and make the relicensing process for nuclear and hydro power plants much easier. But to achieve these goals, we will need some changes in the existing energy policies. 
   We need incentives to increase domestic production of oil and gas, particularly on Federal lands where this administration has simply refused to allow oil and gas exploration. About 64 percent of the overthrust belt has been determined to be over limits. 
   In my State of Alaska, where you are very likely to have a large discovery in a small sliver of the Arctic, about 1.5 million acres out of 19 million acres has been put off limits. 
   We need incentives and R&D funds to develop and promote clean fossil fuel technology. 
   We need to use more natural gas for end-use appliances and distributed generation of electricity through fuel cells and microturbines in homes and businesses. 
   We need to eliminate barriers to our best sources of nonemitting power generation; namely, nuclear and hydro. 
   And we need to encourage and support renewable energy technologies. 
   Based on some simple calculations by my Energy and Natural Resource Committee staff, we estimate that such a balanced energy plan could reduce our emissions by 11 percent, compared to the administration's plan, by the year 2020. We could do this without economic cost and without sacrificing our quality of life or our competitive situation with little economic pain. 
   Our staff is working to refine these calculations further. But the details really do not matter much. Simply put, if we use more nuclear, more hydro, and more natural gas, we emit fewer greenhouse gases and we reduce our dependence on foreign oil in the year 2020 from 68 percent, as projected under the administration's plan, to less than 50 percent under the Republican plan. Clearly, that is a step in the right direction. 
   With further R&D funding for climate-friendly energy technology, such as that proposed in our climate change bill, S. 882, we can do better. A balanced energy portfolio simply makes good sense for our economy, for our environment, and for our national security. We have proposed legislation that will take us there. 
   Let me close by noting that it seems ironic this administration has wasted no opportunity to talk about the dire predictions of climate change. 
   Yet the Republican energy plan offers a cleaner, more secure energy future. 
   The risk of human-induced climate change is a risk we should responsibly address. We should address it based on sound science, and not emotion, as is often the case around here. A balanced, technology-driven energy strategy offers the means to do so. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I commend Chairman WARNER for the significant improvements he and his committee have proposed for the TRICARE system. However I am concerned that the current proposals do not address access problems in rural states, and I am offering this amendment to alleviate this problem. 
   Military healthcare is one of the most important quality of life issues for my constituents. I have heard countless times how civilian doctors are refusing to see TRICARE patients because of the extremely low rates at which they are reimbursed. Because an adequate civilian healthcare provider network is required to supplement the military healthcare system, especially in rural states, TRICARE is failing to provide the kind of healthcare our service members, retirees and their dependents deserve. 
   In rural states like my home state of Alaska, this is a huge problem. Medical costs are much higher than average, and there are fewer doctors. Having fewer doctors to compete with reduces physicians' incentive to accept the extremely low pay from TRICARE. In fact, in Alaska, doctors who see TRICARE patients are paid less than when they see Medicaid patients. 
   Frankly, I am very concerned that the government would consider those who serve in our armed forces as less worthy of quality care than welfare recipients. When doctors refuse to see TRICARE beneficiaries and their dependents, they are forced to pay for their care themselves, or go without it all together. I have heard too often from Alaskans in the military who are frustrated that they cannot receive care because doctors cannot afford to see them. I would like to read the following letter from one of my constituents and ask unanimous consent that it be entered into the RECORD. 
   The Department of Defense has the authority to raise the rates they pay doctors if they decide that a region has access problems. In fact, they are in the process of doing this in parts of Alaska. However they have excluded Anchorage, the largest city in the state. This is where the largest portion of beneficiaries live, and where the largest access problem exists. It is clear to me that the Department of Defense is not properly assessing where access is a problem. Because of this, it is time for Congress to act. 
   My amendment will raise the rates the Department of Defense pays to civilian doctors who see TRICARE patients. It also calls on the Department of Defense to conduct a study assessing access problems in rural states, and present Congress ways to solve these problems.  
   When men and women in the armed services, retirees and their dependents are refused treatment by civilian doctors, it has a direct effect on morale. They begin to think twice when it comes time to reenlist or leave. I am sure they are not recommending service to the young people in their family and community. With our current recruitment and retention problems in the military, I think it is our responsibility in the Senate to give TRICARE beneficiaries the kind of high quality healthcare they have earned through their dedication to this nation. 
   I urge my colleagues to accept this important amendment.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, a few days ago, June 12, we were advised of a security incident associated with our Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. The particular notification initially came out in a press release from Los Alamos, unlike a press release from the Department of Energy. It specifically stated that the Los Alamos National Laboratory announced a joint Department of Energy-Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiry underway into the missing classified information at the DOE Laboratory. The information was stored on two hard drives. It was an electronic transfer. These two hard drives were unaccounted for. 
   This is a serious matter, to say the least. The press release indicated that at this point there is no evidence that suggests espionage involved in this incident. 
   Today we had an opportunity to hold a joint hearing between the Intelligence Committee, chaired by Senator SHELBY, and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which I chair. It was rather enlightening because the Secretary of Energy was not there, although he was invited. The significance of what we learned was that no one bears the ultimate responsibility. The Department of Energy suggests that they designated certain people to bear this responsibility. There was a process and procedure underway, but circumstances associated with the disastrous fire, the need for evacuation and other factors, all led to the missing documentation and the two hard drives. 
   I can generalize and suggest that, well, our national security to a degree went up in smoke at the time of the disastrous fires in New Mexico. You can lose your car keys, but you don't lose these hard drives. 
   What we are talking about is the very highest security interests of this Nation. Missing on the hard drives is the highly sensitive information that covers not only the Russian nuclear weapons programs but how we arm and disarm nuclear devices. Imagine what  this would mean if it fell into the hands of terrorists. They could theoretically steal a nuclear device and either arm it or disarm it. That is the kind of information for which we cannot account. 
   Earlier today this body voted 97-0 to confirm the new czar, Gen. John Gordon, who has been waiting since May for confirmation. It had been held up by Members on the other side who had a hold on his nomination. The question of responsibility is a reasonable one. We had the assurance of the Secretary of Energy that he bore the responsibility for security in the laboratories after we had the Wen Ho Lee incident. That was widely publicized; it was widely debated. Not only that, at that time, Members will recall, there was a special commission set up. This commission came as a result of a report from the House. That report ultimately resulted in the appointment of a former respected Senator, Warren Rudman, who has since retired. The purpose of that report was to analyze the security at the laboratories at that particular time. 
   I will read a couple of inserts and findings from that report because I think they bear on the credibility of what we are hearing from the Department of Energy. One of the findings stated:  
   More than 25 years worth of reports, studies and formal inquiries--by executive branch agencies, Congress, independent panels, and even the DOE itself--have identified a multitude of chronic security and counterintelligence problems at all of the weapons labs. 
   Critical security flaws ..... have been cited for immediate attention and resolution ..... over and over and over ..... ad nauseam.  
   They haven't been corrected. 
   Further, the report again was the Rudman report. The open-source information alone on the weapons laboratories overwhelmingly supports a troubling conclusion: Their security and counterintelligence operations have been seriously hobbled and relegated to low-priority status for decades. 
   That, again, is associated with the Wen Ho Lee security breach. 
   Finally, Senator Warren Rudman indicates:  
   The Department of Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy that has proven it is incapable of reforming itself. Accountability at DOE has been spread so thinly and erratically that it is now almost impossible to find.  
   Well, we heard this morning that the Secretary is going to appoint--or has appointed--our respected colleague, Senator Howard Baker, and a very distinguished House Member, Lee Hamilton, to give a report on the findings as to the security adequacy at the labs. Well, I welcome this in one sense, and I reflect on it with some question in another, because clearly what Senator Rudman recommended in his report, ``Science at its Best; Security at its Worst'' was not followed by the Department of Energy. 
   The action taken by both the Senate and the House in the manner in which we proceeded with legislation to authorize an energy czar was objected to by the Secretary of Energy through the entire process, almost to the point of eluding congressional intent in the law, and the fact that others felt inclined to hold up his nomination until the vote today, 97-0. I think that reflects on the squeaky wheel theory. The wheel squeaks enough today, and we finally put our czar, Gen. John Gordon, in a responsible position. 
   But the barn door has been left open, and it is inconceivable to me that we have not had adequate explanations of how this could occur. You can go to the library and get a card, take out a book, and they know who took out the book. If you are overdue, you pay a penalty. But not in the Department of Energy secured area. They have their so-called nest people who have access to this. It is estimated that that number is 86 or so. They take this material in and out. 
   What happened is rather interesting on this particular day, according to the testimony we had. I will leave you with this concluding thought: On May 7, the fire was moving toward the laboratory. The obligation of this nest group is to ensure that if the laboratories were to fall victim to the fire so that no one could get in for a period of time, they would have these hard drives available if somewhere there were a nuclear device that was prepared to or exposed somewhere to go off, that this team could take this technology on these two hard drives and go off and disarm them. They had that obligation. So they proceeded to go into the secured area and they asked permission and got permission from one of the deputies to enter. They went to remove the two hard drive disks, and they found that they were gone; they weren't there. 
   Now, what they did is rather interesting. They didn't notify their senior officials. They simply moved over to another shelf where a duplication of these hard drives was available and they took those. Then, after the fire, they went back and searched the place, could not find it, and finally they reported it, I think, on May 24. It was a timeframe from May 7, when the fire started, and on May 24 a team went back and searched again, and then at about the end of 
   May, they called the DOE and in early June the story broke. 
   Those are the facts up until now. When you hear the explanations, you just shake your head and say, how could this happen? And then, of course, the questions we have are: Who might have this information? If they had it, what might they be able to do with it? 
   Some of these questions have to be responded to in a secure environment because of the national security interest. Some have said, well, the appropriators didn't give them enough money to ensure a foolproof system. They asked for $35 million and I think they got $7 million. It doesn't take $7 million to put in a foolproof checkout system. They don't even have cameras in these secured areas. They don't know who is going in and out--other than they have to have a certain security clearance to go in. But there is no checkout system. It is unbelievable. 
   We need answers and we are going to pursue this matter. As a consequence of the situation to date, clearly, the DOE and the labs have not been under control. I hope now that we have cleared the nomination, with the vote of 97-0, of the National Nuclear Security Administrator, that process can get underway. But there are a lot of questions that remain. The two missing hard drives contain secrets about every nuclear weapon in the world--just not ours. We should pursue this matter because clearly the buck has to stop somewhere. 
   When Congressmen NORM DICKS and CHRISTOPHER COX in their report concluded that China had design information--the Wen Ho Lee case--that should have been enough. The report by Senator Warren Rudman should have been an alarm, and the action by the Senate and the House to establish the energy czar should have been enough. But it wasn't. Today, as I said, the squeaky wheel got some grease. We have Gen. John Gordon in the position, but we have a lot of questions unanswered and a lot of people who assured us that they bore the responsibility that everything was under control. We found out today that it isn't. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor in support of the amendment, and thank all the sponsors for their work in this area. 
   The purpose of this amendment, put simply, is to provide compensation to workers who have gotten sick as a result of their exposure to hazardous materials in the course of their efforts to build and test nuclear weapons. We must do right by these workers. They were instrumental in winning the cold war. Their efforts deterred hostile attack and safeguarded our security. 
   I want to highlight a small group of those workers who toiled on a remote island in Alaska to test the largest underground nuclear weapons test our nation ever conducted. 
   Amchitka is an island in the Aleutian arc 1340 miles southwest of Anchorage. As I mentioned, it is the site of the largest underground nuclear test in U.S. history--the so-called ``Cannikin'' test of 1971. This 5 megaton test was preceded by two prior tests: ``Long Shot,'' an 80 kiloton test in 1965; and ``Milrow,'' a 1 megaton test in 1969. 
   According to an independent investigator, Dr. Rosalie Bertell, the ionizing radiation exposure above normal background levels experienced by Amchitka workers ranged from 669 up to 17,240 milliren/year. Workers exposures at Amchitka were primarily due to: 
   Groundwater transport of tritium from the Longshot test; 
   Radionuclides stored on site or used in the shaft, including scandium 46, cesium 137, and other radioactive diagnostic capsuled sources; 
   Radioactive thermoelectric generator (RTG) use; 
   Material released from the Cannikin re-entry operations in 1972; 
   Unfortunately, it appears that The Atomic Energy Commission--the predecessor of today's Department of Energy--did not provide for the proper protection of these workers. According to Dr. Bertell:  
   Although the workers were apparently told that their work was not `hazardous,' they were actually classified as nuclear workers and were exposed to levels of ionizing radiation from non-natural and/or non-normal sources, above the level which at that time was permitted yearly for the general public, namely 500 mrem/year.......Doses received by the men during special assignments and during the post-Cannikin cleanup, exceeded the permissible quarterly dose of 1250 mrem and the maximum permissible yearly dose of 5000 mrem.  
   I would note that the allowable exposure standards for both workers and the general public are much lower today. 
   The actual amount of radiation the Amchitka workers were exposed to is difficult to quantify, Mr. President. These workers generally did not have the protection of radiation safety training or instruction in the proper usage of Thermoluminescent Dosimeters (TLDs). To make matters even worse, exposure records were not kept in many cases by the AEC. Some of the records that were kept by AEC were later lost. While this was not unusual in the very early years of the nuclear age, radiation protection formalities were well established by the late 1960s and 1970s at the time of the Amchitka tests. Yet the proper procedures were not followed and the proper records were not kept. 
   So although these were some likely exposures, the records that could help these workers make a claim under existing authority do not exist through no fault of their own. That is the reason that Amchitka workers are included in the ``Special Exposure Cohort'' with the workers at the Gaseous Diffusion Plants in Portsmouth, Ohio; Paducah, Kentucky; and Oak Ridge, Tennessee. If a member of the special exposure cohort gets a specified disease listed in the amendment that is known to be associated with ionizing radiation, her or she is entitled to appropriate compensation. 
   I appreciate the work of Senator THOMPSON and others, and the consideration given us by the floor managers. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. 
   Mr. President, for more than 30 years, the State of Alaska was subjected to an economic inequity in the administration of the national Medicaid program. 
   With a poverty level 25 percent above the national average, and over one-sixth of the state's population Medicaid-eligible, Alaska delivers health care to many needy children, pregnant women, disabled and elderly poor Americans. These people deserve quality medical care, and Alaska delivers. 
   But three years ago, Congress recognized that the federal government was not paying its fair share of Alaska's Medicaid program. The one-size-fits-all formula that is used to calculate the federal Medicaid match is based upon the per capita income of individual states as it relates to the national per capita income. Simply put, states with higher per capita income pay a higher percentage of Medicaid costs. This formula works well for states that are near national norms for most economic indicators. But it certainly doesn't work in the State of Alaska, where most economic measurements are atypical compared with national averages. 
   The reason is fairly simple. It just costs more to live and do business in Alaska. Per capita income isn't a fair indicator unless it takes into account the cost of delivering care in that area. Somehow, however, the Medicaid formula forgot this. 
   In 1997, when Congress recognized this issue, it adopted legislation that reflected the state's higher costs and increased the federal Medicaid match. Instead of receiving a 50-50 match rate, as the formula would dictate, a 59.8-40.2 percent match rate was established. 
   Unfortunately, this legislation was a short term fix. It only allowed the formula change to remain in effect for  three years. As a result, unless we change the law, the formula will revert to the same inequitable standard that was used previously. And unless we extend the formula change, vital health care services to Alaska's neediest patients will be compromised. 
   For this reason, I am introducing legislation that will extend the federal government's commitment to the health and well-being of Alaska's Medicaid beneficiaries. The ``Alaska Medicaid Equity Act of 2000,'' which is co-sponsored by Senator STEVENS, simply continues the spirit and intent of Congress by adjusting federal medical assistance percentage calculations to account for Alaska's unusually high delivery costs. 
   Three years after we first passed this legislation, the reasons and justifications for the adjustment still exist. The formula is still fundamentally unfair to Alaska. 
   Let me explain why. Alaska's per capita income is $28,523, the 17th highest in the country. In fact, it's right near the national average, which is $28,518. Although Alaska's per capita income suggests it is one of the richer states, it fails to take into account the high cost of living and the high cost of delivering health care. 
   Some studies show that it costs 71 percent more to deliver health care in Alaska. But let's look at some real numbers. From coast to coast, the U.S. dollar buys more goods and services than it does in Alaska. 
   In Portland, Oregon, it costs $66.00 to feed a family of four for one week. In Anchorage it costs $84.15. In Kodiak, that number jumps to $105.88. And out in Dillingham, that number rises to $144.57! We're comparing apples and oranges when we compare Alaska's per capita income to another state's average. 
   And how about electricity? In Portland, 1000 kilowatt hours costs $60.88. Anchorage residents are paying $92.83. Out in Bethel, Alaska, residents are paying $202.68. 
   When focusing solely on the delivery of health care services, the differences stand out even more. In Florida, a hospital room for one day costs, on average, $361. This is in line with lower 48 costs, which run between $350 and $450. In Alaska, that same room costs $748--more than twice as much! A physician office visit is $53 in Florida. That visit costs $80 in Alaska--an increase of 66%! 
   You can look at virtually any good or service and see a comparable difference. A dollar simply doesn't buy the same thing in Alaska that it does in the lower 48. The numbers prove this. The federal government has admitted this. Federal government employees receive a salary adjustment in Alaska--a 25% cost of living adjustment. Military personnel receive a similar increase. Medicare pays higher as well. Even the Federal Poverty Level is adjusted to reflect the unique costs in Alaska. So why doesn't Medicaid? 
   Our bill merely continues the commitment Congress made to Alaska's Medicaid population three years ago. It's fair, and it makes sense. I ask my colleagues to assist me in rectifying this clear inequity for the state of Alaska; I ask my colleagues to support this bill.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an Alaskan institution as it nears its 100th birthday. 
   It is a major tourist attraction in Alaska, the eighth most popular in the state in 1998, boosting ridership in 1999 to about 274,000 passengers. It is an engineering marvel, having been named an International Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1994, such as the Panama Canal, Eiffel Tower, and the Statue of Liberty. It is an historic institution, its history tied directly to that of the Territory and State of Alaska. It got its start because of the famed Klondike Gold Rush of 1898--the last great Gold Rush in North American history. But it is more. 
   The White Pass & Yukon narrow-gauge Railroad is a lasting monument to the power of a dream, and to the ability of this country to mobilize technology. And it is proof positive that if you never give up, you can accomplish any worthwhile task, no matter how difficult the challenge. That lesson is as important today, as it was in 1900, at the line's completion. 
   It was early in 1898 when two men came north intent upon solving a transportation dilemma--intent upon moving men and supplies across the daunting Coast Mountains of Southeast Alaska, so they could reach the gold fields of the Yukon to forge national wealth for both Canada and America from the virgin wilderness. Sir Thomas Tancrede, a representative of a group of British financiers and Michael J. Heney, a Canadian railway contractor, by chance met one night at a hotel bar in Skagway, Alaska. 
   Tancrede, after detailed surveys, had concluded that it was impossible to build a railroad through the rugged St. Elias Mountains that separate the interior of the Yukon from Alaska at the northern end of the Alaska Panhandle. But Heney had just the opposite view. After an all-night ``discussion,'' one of the world's great railroad projects was no longer a dream, but an accepted challenge. 
   On May 28, 1898, construction began on the White Pass & Yukon Route. Utilizing tons of black powder and thousands of workers the project began. Two months later the railroad's first engine pulled an excursion train from Skagway north over the first four miles of completed track, making the WP&YR, the northernmost railroad in the Western Hemisphere--the first built above 60 degrees north latitude. 
   From there on, the going got tough. The railroad, truly an international undertaking, climbed from sea level at the docks in Skagway through sheer mountains to 2,865 feet at the summit of the White Pass. It faces grades as steep as 3.9 percent. Heney's workers hung suspended by ropes from the vertical granite cliffs, chipping away with picks and planting black powder to blast a right-of-way through the mountains. Heavy snow and temperatures as low as -60 F hampered the work. And the mere whisper of a new gold find sent workers scurrying off in droves. 
   With all odds against it, the track reached the summit of White Pass on Feb. 20, 1899 and by July 6, construction reached the headwaters of the great Yukon River at Lake Bennett. While southern gangs blasted their way through the pass, a northern crew worked toward Whitehorse, later the capital of the Yukon Territory. On July 29, 1900, the 110-miles of rails met at Carcross, where a ceremonial spike was driven by Samuel H. Graves, the company's first president. It is that anniversary--the Golden Spike Centennial Celebration--that will take place in Carcross, Yukon Territory, on Saturday, July 29 that is a reason for this statement. 
   Another reason, however, is simply to honor the White Pass, one of the most historic and quaint railroads in the world. Through the years when Alaska was a territory and later a state, the railroad enjoyed a rich and colorful history. It hauled passengers and freight to the Yukon; was a chief supplier for the U.S. Army's Alaska Highway construction project during World War II; and later was a basic freight railroad, hauling metal from the mines of the Yukon to tidewater in Alaska. The company after WWII began modernizing itself, retiring the last of its stream engines in 1964, switching to diesel locomotives. It became a fully-integrated transportation system, carrying freight (containers and highway tractor-trailer units) and passengers from Alaska to Canada's Interior. 
   In 1982, however, world metal prices plummeted and the major mines in the Yukon shut down--metals being the most dependable freight during its first 82 years of service--causing the railroad's operations to be suspended. It was six long years later that the railroad reopened to provide tourist excursions for the 20.4 mile trip from tidewater to the summit of the White Pass and back to Skagway. It also picks up hikers who trek the famed Chilkoot Trail that ends at Lake Bennett and brings them to the Klondike Highway for road transport home. 
   The railroad along the way paid homage to its heritage by saving old steam engine No. 73, a 1947, 2-8-2 Mikado class steam locomotive, and later restoring her for ceremonial service, so that passengers can venture from the docks in historic downtown Skagway--center of the Klondike Gold Rush National Historic Park--toward the old Gold Rush cemetery, just 1.5 miles away. In those few miles, tourists can feel the rumble, hear the noise and experience the romance of historic American train travel. 
   The White Pass embodies Alaska's ``boom-and-bust'' history, being born as a result of the Klondike Gold Rush. It is the direct result of the spirit and economic boom started in August 1896 when George Washington Carmack and his two Indian companions, Skookum Jim and Tagish Charlie, found gold in a tributary of the Klondike, later named Bonzana Creek outside of Dawson. The railroad experienced the territory's malaise in the early 20th Century, until World War II reinvigorated it. It survived the downturn in North American mining industry and is now benefiting from the growth of the nation's tourism industry and America's renewed interest in its history. 
   All of America is better off for the railroad's presence. It today is a slice of living history that helps fuel the imagination of Americans and a love for our nation's past. It is a national treasure that we all need to protect and preserve. Happy Golden Anniversary to all the employees of the railroad and may you have a second great century of exciting and historic travel.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to announce for the information of the Senate and the public that a hearing has been scheduled before the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. 
   The hearing will take place Thursday, June 15, 2000, at 9:30 a.m. in room SD-366 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building in Washington, D.C. 
   The purpose of this hearing is to receive testimony on the goals and specific legislative provisions of S. 2557, the National Energy Security Act of 2000. The bill would protect the energy security of the United States and decrease America's dependency on foreign oil sources to 50 percent by the year 2010 by enhancing the use of renewable energy resources, conserving energy resources, improving energy efficiencies, and increasing domestic energy supplies, mitigating the effect of increases in energy prices on the American consumer, including the poor and elderly, and for other purposes. 
   Presentation of oral testimony is by Committee invitation only. However, those who wish to submit written testimony for the hearing record should send two copies of their testimony to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, United States Senate, 364 Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. 20510-6150.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill with my good friend, Senator BINGAMAN that will reauthorize the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. 
   The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum is America's national institution for the documentation, study, and interpretation of the history of the Holocaust and serves as this country's memorial to the millions of people murdered during the Holocaust. 
   The Museum's primary mission is to advance and disseminate knowledge about the unprecedented tragedy; to preserve the memory of those who suffered; and to encourage its visitors to reflect upon the moral questions raised by the events of the Holocaust as well as their own responsibilities as citizens of a democracy. 
   The work of the Museum is not limited to the building which overlooks the tidal basin here in Washington, D.C. I and my constituents in Alaska have benefitted from the work of the Museum. Through a system of very well designed traveling exhibits the Museum has been able to bring the story of the Holocaust, and its related history to millions of Americans nationwide. I know my constituents in Anchorage and Fairbanks will never forget their opportunity to view the traveling programs. 
   The legislation makes some changes in the management authorities for the Museum and streamlines the procedures to appoint the Museum's Director. The legislation also provides the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum with the same permanent authorization as we have previously provided for the Smithsonian Institution. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am going to take advantage of this time to speak on behalf of the National Energy Security Act of 2000. 
   For the benefit of the Chair, this is the result of a 10-member task force appointed by the Majority Leader, which he asked that I chair. The Task Force included Senators NICKLES, CRAIG, HUTCHISON, COLLINS, DOMENICI, SNOWE, ROTH, SANTORUM, and SMITH of New Hampshire. 
   The bill before us is S. 2557. The purpose of the legislation is to address a harsh reality that it is currently hard to identify just what the administration's policy is toward energy in this country at this time, other than to increase imports of crude oil coming into the country. The Majority Leader charged us to examine the impacts of increased U.S. dependence on foreign energy sources and the resulting increased energy cost to American consumers. 
   It is estimated that the increase in the price of crude oil, which has risen from roughly $10, $11, $12 a barrel a year ago, to as high as $34--and it is currently about $30--has resulted in an increase, if one could compare it to a tax increase, of about $100 billion to the American consumer. 
   If you have taken a cab in Washington, DC, you have noticed there is a little sticker that says they are going to charge 50 cents extra because of the increased cost of gasoline. If you have taken an airplane lately, you have noticed a surcharge from $20 to $40 on your ticket. So the multiplier is out there, Mr. President, and it is a significant factor in adding to inflation. 
   So at the leader's request, we have established a very simple goal for our energy security through this legislation. The goal of the bill is to decrease  America's dependency on foreign oil to less than 50 percent by the year 2010. It is kind of interesting, but the current administration figures indicate that since President Clinton has come to office, we are currently consuming 14 percent more oil than we did approximately 7 years ago and producing 17 percent less. 
   There is indeed a need for an energy policy. This is what the National Energy Security Act of 2000 proposes to establish. 
   We anticipate achieving the goal of reducing our imports of oil through a number of considerations. 
   One is enhancing the use of renewable energy resources--including hydro, wind, solar, and biomass. We spend a good deal for experimental funding for these renewable sources. But the reality is we have a long way to go before they are going to take a major share of our energy production. 
   Second, we are proposing to conserve energy resources and improve energy efficiencies. 
   Third, we propose to increase domestic energy supplies, including oil, gas, and coal. 
   The bill also addresses the concerns of regional consumers, particularly in the Northeast. 
   It allows the Department of Energy's Secretary Richardson to create a home heating oil reserve and strengthen the weatherization program. 
   It establishes a State-led education program to encourage consumers to take action to minimize seasonal price increases and shortages of home heating fuel. 
   It provides incentives for construction and rehabilitation of private home heating oil storage facilities. 
   The purpose is very simple. Imported energy should supplement our domestic energy supplies--not supplant them. 
   The administration has looked for a quick fix and has pointed fingers. We understand that the American energy supply problem cannot be solved overnight. It is going to take a long-term view. We have to take it one step at a time. But it is time to begin taking those steps and that is a process we further today. 
   The administration continues to lull the American public into a sense of indifference about energy supplies and the energy situation and has really hidden behind a slight decrease in prices at the pump. However, I would suggest these reductions in price are not here to stay. 
   I refer to an article that appears in the Wall Street Journal of May 16 entitled ``Tight U.S. Gas Markets Boost Oil Prices''--a price of $30, and a year ago it was $12 or $13. 
   What about the inflation factor? A significant indicator is the increased cost of energy. 
   What about the balance of payments? One-third of our $300 billion deficit balance of payments--$100 billion--is the cost of imported oil. 
   As a consequence, we have had an opportunity to hear from consumers all over the country stung by the high prices of heating oil, particularly in the Northeast corridor. And it is fair to say that as we go into the summer, this particular area of the country, which is approximately 30-percent dependent on oil-powered generation, will experience substantial price increases as a consequence of increased energy demand, particularly for air-conditioning. 
   It is estimated that electricity costs in the Northeast region may double what they were last year and in some cases triple. 
   The idea is that the older oil-fired power generation facilities are the last to come online, and ordinarily there is a windfall profit associated with that. Whatever it takes to support financially the cost of the higher generating resource--namely, oil--the other energy sources, whether they be gas or coal, rise to that price level--a practice known as ``uniform pricing.'' The consumer is stuck as a consequence, and prices go up as a result of the windfall profit. 
   Finally, as the economies of Asia, Europe, and the United States continue to grow in the context of a set energy market, there will be increasing demands for energy resources by the fourth 
   quarter of this year, again leading to tightening of petroleum supplies and a corresponding increase in prices. 
   Many of us in this body on both sides of the aisle have made statements that the administration really lacks an energy policy. If you go back and recognize that in 1973 and 1974 we were 34-percent dependent on imported oil, today we are 56-percent dependent. And last month we got up to 61-percent dependence. 
   The realities are, if we look to increasing imports to offset our increased consumption as well as the rest of the world, we are going to be paying the piper because, as indicated in this article today, we can look to OPEC and we can look to Venezuela, but, nevertheless, they have indicated self-discipline, and the price range is expected to be somewhere between $22 and $28 a barrel, which suggests, if you will, that the discipline to maintain this price is there. 
   I see another Member of our task force is on the floor and intends to speak on this. 
   As I have outlined our proposal in general terms and identified our goals--I again point out the realization that we want to protect energy security, we want to protect consumers and low-income families, and we want to increase domestic energy supplies--it should be noted that the last written statement from the administration about its proposal on energy was a narrow one. It came out during the last week of April from the Office of the Secretary of Energy, entitled ``Energy Secretary Richardson Announced Six Short-Term Actions to Help Prevent Power Outages.'' 
   I think it is appropriate to highlight just what this contains because clearly it does not address increased production. 
   It specifically states in the six points: 
   First, to work with agencies to identify opportunities to reduce liquid consumption and Federal water problems during times of peak demand. 
   I assume that means we are going to shut off water and our irrigation projects. 
   Second, it urges the Federal Regulatory Commission and State utilities to commission, solicit, and improve targets that will help reduce electric demand. 
   So we are going to propose an increase in the price of electricity to ensure that people reduce their consumption. 
   Third, explore opportunities for use of existing backup generators during power supply emergencies. 
   I wonder if we are going to confiscate the private sector generators. 
   Fourth, conduct an emergency exercise with State and local governments to help prepare for outages. 
   It looks as if they are pretty much giving up the ship and are preparing for those outages as opposed to generating more energy. 
   Fifth, work closely with the utility industry to gain up-to-date, relevant information about potential grid-related problems. 
   They are going to keep us informed. 
   Lastly, they are going to prepare public service announcements. So we will know what is coming. 
   I hardly think that fits the bill as we address the need for precise energy policy and the realization that the administration lacks an energy policy of any kind. 
   In conclusion, let's relate the position the administration has taken with regard to energy. 
   There is no effort to spur domestic oil and gas production. 
   There is no effort to open up the area of the Rocky Mountain overthrust belt to encourage exploration for gas. 
   There is no effort by the administration to loosen the noose they have put around the neck of our domestic energy industries. 
   They are refusing to resolve the nuclear waste issue. 
   They have refused to recognize hydro as a renewable resource and are proposing in some cases to take dams down out west. 
   If you identify the energy resources and recognize the position of the administration, it is quite clear that they do not have an energy policy. That is why I commend the leader and the other members of the task force for developing a plan that is a workable, achievable plan that will substantially address the emergency associated with our energy situation in this country. I again refer to this as the National Energy Security Act of 2000. 
   I see the leader on the floor, and perhaps at this time he wishes to introduce the bill and make some remarks.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I compliment my friend from Idaho. He has outlined very carefully the basic underlying theme, which is we are proposing an energy policy. That energy policy is enunciated in the National Energy Security Act of 2000, S. 2557, which was introduced by the leadership this morning and on whose behalf the Senator from Idaho has spoken. 
   We have--I emphasize this--we have laid down an energy policy for this country. I suggest there is not one Member who can identify specifically what is the administration's energy policy. We know what it is not. Let's take nuclear power. We know they are opposed to it. They will not address the issue of nuclear waste. 
   We know they are against domestic oil and gas production. 
   We know they are against hydroelectric power expansion. 
   We know they are against new natural gas pipelines. 
   What are they for then? It is pretty hard to identify until one begins looking at the record of the Secretary in trying to generate relief from the oil shortage we are experiencing. 
   I will speak about the oil shortage specifically because it is very real and is identified on this chart. 
   This chart is designated by quarter, this is global demand and global supply for each quarter this year. The reality is, by the end of the fourth quarter, the demand will exceed the supply by about 2 million barrels a day. I could spend a lot of time on this chart and show where the oil comes from--OPEC, Iraq, OPEC supply, non-OPEC supply--but we have a basic economic factor where we have more demand than supply. When we have that kind of situation, the price goes up and the American taxpayers pay through the nose. Last year, oil was $11, $12, $13 a barrel. Earlier this year, we saw $34-a-barrel oil. Currently we are at about $29 to $30. 
   Where are we looking to accommodate this increase demand with this administration? We are looking to Iraq--  of all nations of the world, Iraq. Think about it. This next chart shows our imports from Iraq. They were very small through 1997. In 1998, they began to jump up. The specifics are, in 1998 we imported 300,000 barrels a day from Iraq; currently, we are importing 700,000 barrels a day. How quickly we forget that in 1990 and 1991 we fought a war with Iraq. We lost 293 American lives. There were 467 wounded. There was a cost to the American taxpayers of approximately $7.4 billion. 
   What have we done since then? We have enforced a no-fly zone. That is very similar to an aerial blockade. 
   What has it cost the taxpayers of this country since the war? It has cost the taxpayers approximately $10 billion just to keep Saddam Hussein fenced in. 
   The American press does not even print this anymore. We get the figures from the French press of what is going on over there. Enforcing the no-fly zone in Iraq has required more than 240,000 sorties since the end of the gulf war at an average cost of $7 million an hour. We have flown 21,000 missions since 1998. We have bombed them on more than 145 days since Desert Fox in December of 1998. Since December of 1998, Iraq reports 295 of their citizens have been killed and 860 wounded in airstrikes. Airstrikes on Iraq occur almost daily. Where are we looking for oil? Iraq. What kind of a foreign policy does this administration have? 
   Saddam Hussein seems to be deliberately luring us, sadistically using his own people as bait, into killing innocent Iraqis for sympathy to lift the no-fly zone. At the same time, he is dramatically increasing his own military capacity. What is happening? He is smuggling out an awful lot of oil. What is he using the funds for? Every Member of this body should get a classified briefing from the Intelligence Committee and find out for themselves what he is doing. It is a very dangerous situation with which we are going to have to reckon at some point in time, and God help us. 
   U.N. sanctions certainly have not done the job. What we are doing with Saddam Hussein is rewarding him. Iraq will export $8.5 billion in oil this year, and it is estimated the smuggling will generate approximately $400 million which goes to enrich Saddam Hussein and goes to his Republican Guard which keeps him alive. 
   Think about it. We are looking to Iraq for our oil. 
   What is Iraq looking towards? This is a bizarre pattern. 
   If we think about it, it is fairly simple. It is so simple that I hope my colleagues will reflect on its significance. He uses the money we send him for new arms--new biological technology--we take his oil, and we fill our warplanes. And what do we do? We go bomb him. Then we buy some more of his oil, send him some money, and the process starts all over again. 
   We are spending billions and billions of dollars to contain Iraq's expansion, and billions and billions of dollars to permit Iraqi expansion by increasing their refining capacity. As we do this we are risking the lives of American service men and women, our security, the security of our allies, and the American way of life, if you will, pursuing an energy policy which can only end in a tragedy. 
   I think today my colleagues who have joined the leader in the introduction of the National Energy Security Act of 2000 have put forward an energy plan, an energy policy. It is up to the administration now to match it. Because so far the only thing the administration has done is to come out with six very weak short-term actions: to help prevent power outages which would terminate the generation to Federal water projects; it would encourage price increases; it would explore the opportunities for the inventory of generators held by the private sector; it would conduct emergency exercises; it would work with the utility industry to update information; and prepare public service announcements. 
   What kind of an energy policy is that? 
   I see my good friend, the junior Senator from Texas, seeking recognition. 
   Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference report to H.R. 434, the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act. I believe passage of this legislation is important to cement what has become the broad, bi-partisan consensus of this body: trade is a key factor in raising living standards in developing countries, and is of primary importance in exporting to those countries key American values of human rights, democratization, peace and stability. 
   Mr. President, in supporting this legislation I do not suggest that trade alone is a panacea for the many difficulties in developing countries. Simply opening the door to trade with African countries will not enable many of these countries to enter the international community of developed nations. Many countries in Africa simply lack the basic health, education and economic infrastructures to take advantage of the benefits this legislation provides. 
   Trade and investment initiatives for Africa will not succeed without substantial investments in developing Africa's human resources. 
   For those sub-Saharan African countries who labor under a crippling debt burden, some measure must be taken to assist them to break free from reliance on debt provided by donor countries. Debt relief should be the highest priority of donor countries, including the United States, seeking to promote African economic development. 
   This legislation should therefore be hailed not as an end in itself, but as a good beginning to a longer-term policy which, under U.S. leadership, begins to draw Africa more closely into the global community. We need to begin now to ensure that U.S. policy will do more to promote regional economic cooperation and integration in Africa; U.S. Policymakers, including those in this body, should undertake broader and more regular consultation with Africa's governmental, non-governmental and private sector leadership, and we should ensure that the eligibility standards contained in this legislation carefully account for differing levels of development. To that end, we should be careful not to rely too closely on conditions such as those employed by the International Monetary Fund in applying eligibility standards under this legislation. 
   Mr. President, the importance of this legislation is both its historic significance as the first major piece of trade legislation in twelve years and its precedential significance in marking the importance of trade benefits as a ``carrot'' and not a ``stick'' to bring international social and living standards in developing standards more close to international norms. 
   Rather than holding this legislation hostage to concerns which can and must be addressed in the longer-term. I would urge my colleagues to take this first step on the road of a broader, more sensible policy toward the developing world, and pass this legislation.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to establish the Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm National Heritage Area in my State of Alaska. 
   The Heritage Area, when enacted, will include the first leg of the Iditarod National Historic Trail and most of the Seward Highway National Scenic Byway. Through National Heritage designation these routes will be portrayed and interpreted as part of the whole picture of human history in the wider transportation corridor through the mountains, which includes early Native trade routes, connections by waterway, the railroad, and other trails and roadways. 
   This proposal differs from the 16 existing National Heritage Areas. The fact that it would be one of a kind strengthens the case for designation. 
   Unlike any of the existing National Heritage Areas, the Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm National Historic Corridor will highlight the experience of the western frontier--of transportation and settlement in a difficult landscape--of the gold rush and resource development in a remote area. These are the themes of the proposal--themes that formed our perception of ourselves as a nation. The proposed Heritage Area wonderfully expresses these themes. 
   Within the proposed Heritage Area there are a number of small historic communities that developed around transportation and the gold rush. They are dwarfed by the sweeping landscapes of the region, by the magnificence of the mountains, and the dominance and strength of nature. 
   Turnagain Arm, once a critical transportation link, has the world's second largest tidal range. Visitors can stand along the shore lines and actually watch 30-foot tides move in and out of the arm. On occasion, the low roar of an oncoming bore tide can be heard as a wall of water sweeps up the Turnagain. 
   A traveler through the alpine valleys and mountain passes of the Heritage Area can see evidence of retreating glaciers, earthquake subsidence, and avalanches. Dall sheep, beluga whales, moose, bald eagles, trumpeter swans, and Artic terns give glimpses of their presence. 
   Through this rugged terrain humans have developed transportation routes into South-central and Interior Alaska. Travel was channeled through the valleys and on the rivers and fjord-like lakes. First came Alaska Natives, establishing trading paths. Later the Russians, gold rush stampeders, and all types of people arrived seeking access into the resource-rich land. The famous Iditarod Trail to Nome, which was used to haul mail in and gold out, started at Seward. 
   A series of starts and stops by railroad entrepreneurs eventually culminated in the completion of the railroad from Seward to Fairbanks by the federal government. President Harding boarded the train in Seward in 1923 to drive the golden spike at Nenana (and died on the boat returning to Seattle). It was only in the last half of this century that the highway from Seward to Anchorage was opened. Before then the small communities of the area were linked to the rest of Alaska by wagon trail, rail, and by boat across Turnagain Arm and the Kenai River. 
   The Heritage Area contains one of the earliest mining regions in Alaska. Russians left evidence of their search for gold at Bear Creek near Hope. In 1895, discovery of a rich deposit at Canyon Creak precipitated the Turnagain Arm Gold Rush, predating the stampede to the Klondike. 
   The early settlements and communities of the area are still very much as they were in the past. But, as in the early days, this is a region where ``nature is boss,'' and historic trails and evidence of mining history are often embedded and nearly hidden in the landscape. What can be seen stands as powerful testimony to the human fortitude, perseverance, and resourcefulness that is America's proudest heritage from the people who settled the Alaskan frontier. 
   People living in the Kenai Mountains--Turnagain Arm areas share a sense that it is a special place. In part, this is simply because of the sheer natural beauty; but it is also because the Alaska frontier is relative recent. Memories of the times when the inhabitants were dependent on their own resources, and on each other, are still very much alive. 
   Communities are small, but they are alive with volunteerism. All have active historical societies. Groups in Seward and Girdwood have organized to rebuild the Iditarod Trail. In the town of Hope citizens constructed a museum of mining history, building it themselves out of logs and donated materials. Local people have conducted historic building surveys, written books and short histories, collected and published old diaries, and created web pages to record and share the history of their communities. Seward, the corridor's gateway, has created a delightful array of visitor opportunities that display and interpret the region's natural setting, Native culture, and history. National Heritage Area designation would greatly encourage and expand these good efforts. 
   Mr. President, it is important to note that this National Heritage Area is a local grass roots effort and it will remain a locally driven grass roots effort. Decisions will be made by locals, not by Federal bureaucrats. The only role of the Federal Government is to provide technical expertise, mostly in the areas of the interpretation of the many historic sites and tremendous natural resource features that are found throughout the entire region. There will be no additional land ownership by the Federal Government or by the local management entity that is charged with putting together a coordinated plan to interpret the Heritage Area. The Heritage Area is about local people working together.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we are again faced with the decision of whether to put off an obligation that we have to store nuclear waste that is threatening our industry or just talk some more. 
   If we reflect on reality, we will find that the last time this issue came before the Senate we had 64 votes in favor. There was one Senator who was  absent. We anticipate that Senator to be here today, so we anticipate approximately 65 votes. In the House, it passed 253-167. So, clearly, a majority in the House and Senate have spoken on this issue. 
   We have before us the question of the President's veto on the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. I say that the President is wrong. He is wrong for the environment, wrong for the U.S. energy policy, wrong for the economy, and he is wrong for international security. 
   This has become pretty much a political issue on the floor--whether to override the President's veto and do what is right. What is right is to address the responsibility that we have to the taxpayers of this country. I urge every Member of this body to reflect on the obligation that he or she has at this time. We have a situation where, as a consequence of the inability of the Federal Government to take the waste, which was to occur in 1998, we have a breach of contract with several of our utility companies. That breach of contract has resulted in liability and damages--damages that are assessed now at somewhere between $40 billion and $80 billion. So every Member of this body who does not support an override better be prepared to respond to the American taxpayer and address the reasons and have an excuse for not moving this and terminating that extended liability to the taxpayers. 
   While the President's veto wasn't based on good science, it was based on crass politics. The President's veto is particularly troublesome because Congress has bent over backward to meet every legitimate concern expressed by this administration. So it is simply clear that this administration doesn't want to take up this matter and resolve it under any circumstances under their watch. 
   Instead, they apparently want to use it as an election year issue. Well, I think it will come back and bite them as an election year issue. The bill the President vetoed would have disposed of our nuclear waste in a rational and effective way. It would do so by providing early receipt at Yucca Mountain of our civilian and our defense nuclear waste 5 years earlier than under existing law but not until after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved a construction permit for the facility, and it would have protected the $16 billion nuclear waste fund from being raided to pay for the Government's default on its contract with the utilities--money that consumers have paid through higher electric rates. It would have protected consumers from the Secretary of Energy unilaterally and unreasonably raising the nuclear waste tax on electricity without the consent of Congress, and it would have preserved the right of the Environmental Protection Agency to set the radiation standards in a manner that fully protects public health and safety. 
   If you go back and read the bill, it clearly gives the Environmental Protection Agency the obligation of setting the standard. Failure to address this problem does not solve the problem by any means; it simply leaves the waste where it is. 
   I would like to refer to this chart in back of me because this is the reality. We have the waste at 80 sites in 40 States. It is located in our backyards. Each year that goes by, our ability to continue to store nuclear waste in each of these sites in a safe and reasonable way diminishes. Why? These sites were designed for temporary storage and, in many cases, they have about reached their maximum. Isn't it better to put this at one site, at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, which was designed for the waste? 
   It is irresponsible to let this situation continue. Rather than exhibiting courage and signing legislation that would address the problem, the President has abdicated his responsibility. Rather than protect the American people, he has chosen to sacrifice them to satisfy the anti-nuclear interests. 
   The veto is absolutely wrong for the environment. Again, I refer to this chart. Is it better to have this material scattered at 80 sites in 40 States or one, single, easily-monitored location which, I add, is where we have had over 50 years of nuclear testing out in the Nevada desert? This veto means that the administration wants to continue to keep this material near our major population centers, near schools, hospitals, parks, homes, areas where we have earthquakes, such as in California, and in other areas, such as Illinois, where we have severe windstorms at times. The administration's own draft environmental impact statement released in August of last year makes it clear that leaving the material spread around the country could represent a considerable human health risk. 
   His veto is wrong for the U.S. energy policy. The real agenda of this administration is to kill nuclear power as a means to provide electricity, but they never answered the tough questions--the reality that nuclear power generation consists of 20 percent of the Nation's electricity. It does so without emanating any air pollution or greenhouse gases. How do we address the risk of global warming without nuclear power? It is pretty hard to do. How do we meet our clean air requirements and goals without nuclear power? 
   There is no alternative suggested by the administration. How do we provide consumers and our economy with the electricity they need if we rule out our nuclear power? The answer is very simple: We can't. 
   The choice we face is either replace nuclear power with coal-fired power or consumers will go without; that means brownouts, perhaps blackouts. But this should come as no surprise to an administration that has allowed this Nation to become dependent on insecure sources of foreign oil to meet our energy needs. Our energy policy consists of the Secretary of Energy going hat-in-hand to beg for help from countries that once sought our protection to maintain their existence. We have recently seen our increased dependence on oil from Saddam Hussein and Iraq. It was 300,000 barrels a day last year, and this year it is 700,000 barrels a day. 
   Isn't it rather ironic, as we look at the foreign policy of this country, to recognize that we buy Saddam Hussein's oil and give him our dollars, and we take that oil, put it in our airplanes, and we go out and bomb him. 
   That is really what we are doing. How ironic. 
   Furthermore, it has cost the American taxpayer about $10 billion since the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991 to keep Saddam Hussein fenced in. 
   The veto is wrong for the economy. Failure to resolve the nuclear waste problem may well turn into a budgetary disaster that will rival the savings and loan crisis. 
   I say that as a consequence of the increasing liability that goes to the Federal Government for its inability to take that waste when it was due under the contract terms in 1998. That is over $40 billion. It may be closer to $80 billion. That is a liability that is being assumed by the American taxpayer as we delay addressing this obligation. 
   By failing to resolve the nuclear waste problem, the Federal courts have said this administration has violated its contractual obligations. As I said, this means the Department of Energy may have to pay as much as $40 billion to $80 billion in liability, and possibly more. Where do you think this money is going to come from? You guessed it. The taxpayer. And every Member who doesn't support this veto override had better be able to explain that to his or her constituents. Instead of using this money to keep Social Security solvent, we have to use it to pay for this administration's willful failure to comply with the law. 
   But keep in mind that even after the taxpayers foot this bill, the nuclear waste problem still won't be dealt with because the President simply won't stand up and recognize that we have an obligation under a contract made 20 years ago to accept the waste. 
   Further, it is wrong for the international security of this Nation. How do we convince our allies and those who are not to abide by our goal of nuclear nonproliferation when we demonstrate that we have neither the will nor the intelligence to deal with our own domestic problem? How do we convince our European allies to look to us and not Russia for solutions when we demonstrate that we do not have the courage to follow science and our own law? What type of leadership do we show to the world when we are unwilling to honor our commitments to our own citizens? It is not only our security that is jeopardized but also that of our allies who depend on our willingness and capability to defend them to enforce a peace.  
   This is referred to as a ``mobile Chernobyl'' by some. Opponents of the legislation argue that shipping nuclear waste across the Nation will create a ``mobile Chernobyl.'' The administration seems to agree with these opponents. Yet this very same administration agreed in 1996 to accept 20 tons of foreign nuclear high-level waste shipped to the United States. The administration's Foreign Research Reactor Program brought that in. This foreign nuclear waste is being moved safely in the very same way and in the very same casks that the opponents say U.S. nuclear waste cannot be moved safely. 
   Let me also observe as we are talking about ``mobile Chernobyls'' that there are 83 nuclear-powered U.S. submarines and naval warships which operate under nuclear power. They are around the world. They operate around the clock in both U.S. and foreign ports to ensure our security. They carry the reactors, and they have done it in a safe and admirable manner for a long period of time. There does not seem to be any concern about these ships. And the shipments we are talking about are dry, stable waste, and not reactors. But they criticize it in the capacity of suggesting this is a Chernobyl-style act. This is fear mongering. It is unnecessary. It is fear in the worst case. 
   Finally, we recognize the obligation of our Chief Executive. The President of the United States had a choice. The President could have shown courage and chosen for the environment. Instead, he declined. The President could have shown leadership and chosen 
   a sound energy policy. Instead, he refused. The President could have demonstrated concern for the future and chosen for a healthy economy. Instead, he ducked. The President could have shown resolve on our national and international obligations and chosen for our national security. Instead, he abdicated. The President's veto was wrong for the environment, for energy policy, for the economy, and for our national security. 
   Today, our choice is a simple one. 
   Again, I note on this chart behind me, all of those areas in green are the States where nuclear waste is stored, 40 States. Do we want to have that, or do we want to have one central disposal facility at Yucca Mountain where we have already expended $6 billion or $7 billion in the design of a permanent repository? Do we want to move it to one central facility in an area where over 800 nuclear devices were tested? 
   I show you a chart and a picture of the proposed location for the permanent repository at the Nevada site. It was used for previous testing of more than 800 nuclear weapons. 
   I urge my colleagues not to be misguided and to support the veto override. 
   Before I yield some time to the other side, I want to make a couple of points relative to the radiation issue which has come up from time to time. 
   One of the principles originally in S. 1287 was that the Yucca Mountain radiation standards should be set by the NRC and not the EPA. Although I still strongly believe that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission should set this standard, the managers' amendment contains new language--I hope my colleagues will read it--that will permit the EPA to go ahead with its rule as long as both the EPA and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, in consultation with the National Academy of Sciences, agrees that the standard will protect public health, safety, and the environment, and is reasonable and obtainable. If that isn't the best science available, I don't know what is. 
   This is a very reasonable approach that provides the very best science and the very best peer review, yet allows the EPA to have the obligation to ultimately complete the rule after all the best minds on the subject have been consulted. 
   I think it is apparent as we address this issue--and I recognize that my State of Alaska does not have nuclear waste stored in it--that if we don't resolve it today, we are going to have to address it at a later date because the fact is nobody wants this waste. 
   I am particularly sensitive to and appreciate the position of my colleagues from Nevada. The bottom line is they don't want the waste. If the waste were going to be stored in Colorado, we would have the Senators from Colorado speaking here on the floor and objecting to it. It is going to be stored in California, or New Hampshire, or somewhere. That is just the harsh reality of recognizing that no one wants this waste. 
   But my colleagues from Nevada claim that the Congress chose Nevada to be studied for nuclear waste disposal purely for political reasons. They would have you believe that there are no rational, technical, or scientific reasons for placing spent nuclear fuel in Nevada. That is what they would have you believe. But it is wrong. 
   The DOE spent over $1 billion studying other potential sites before narrowing the list to three sites, one of which was Yucca Mountain. Congress settled on Yucca Mountain back in 1987. It is geologically unique. The Nevada Test Site has been used to explode nuclear weapons for over 50 years. 
   This is a picture of the Nevada site. The last weapon exploded there underground was in 1991. The underground tests are still being performed, with nuclear materials being exploded with conventional explosives, with the wholehearted support of the 
   Nevada delegation. In fact, not too long ago one of the Senators from Nevada supported storing spent fuel at the test site. There was a resolution that I believe took place back in 1975 or 1976. 
   The resolution reads as follows. This is a resolution from the Nevada Assembly, Joint Resolution 15:  
   Whereas, the people of Southern Nevada have confidence in the safety record of the Nevada test site and the ability of the staff of the site to maintain safety in the handling of nuclear materials; 
   Whereas, nuclear disposal can be carried out at the Nevada test site with minimal capital investment relative to other locations; 
   Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Assembly of the State of Nevada jointly with the Legislature of the State of Nevada strongly urges the Energy Research and Development Administration to choose the Nevada test site for the disposal of nuclear waste.  
   This resolution passed the Nevada Senate by a 12-6 vote, aided by a vote at that time of then State Senator BRYAN and signed by the Governor of Nevada. 
   What has changed? The Nevada Test Site has not changed. It has the workers, a workforce, an infrastructure for dealing with nuclear materials. The geology has not changed.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. The subheading reads:  
   U.S. tries to drum up business for Nevada's Test Site by urging companies to use it for research too risky to try anywhere else. No job is too big, promotional brochures boast. It is huge. It is impossible to scrub clean. We are selling the concept of a place where you can do things you can't do anywhere else, said Tim Carlson, who runs the NTS Development Corporation, a nonprofit commission by the Governor to market the site.  
   A few more observations from Nevadans quoted by the story:  
   We take these companies out of someone's backyard and put them here. They are never going to be able to reclaim it for 10,000 or 15,000 years, says Randy Harness of the Sierra Club's Las Vegas chapter. They might as well do research there.  
   He concludes:  
   Given the constant monitoring, the site is probably the safest place in the whole United States. 
   We want to take the technology and the personnel we have in the nuclear industry and apply it to new areas so we are doing things for society instead of just blowing up bombs, said Steven Rice, assistant provost for the University of Nevada, Los Vegas.  
   Or, as the Nuclear Testing Site Development's Haase put it:  
   Taxpayers paid for this place, after all. They should get some use out of it.  
   We are seeing a situation develop where it is fair to say we have the final obligation in the Congress of the United States to address this with resolve once and for all.  
   I will comment briefly on the specifics of the veto the President saw fit to initiate. In looking at the President's veto message, the President presented the argument that S. 1287 is a step backward because delaying the issue regarding radiation standards delays any decision with regard to the site recommendation. The reality is the radiation standard is only necessary for the license application through March 2000. 
   The other argument the President reports is that the bill adds unnecessary bureaucracy to issuing standards and delays. The bill says specifically that the EPA issues the radiation standards by June 2001. EPA must also compare provisions with the National Academy's recommendation and justify this scientific basis for the rule. If good science unduly burdens the EPA, then perhaps we have a problem with the proposed rule. We are talking about the EPA having the final determination. 
   The President further states that the bill does not help with claims against the Federal Government for damages related to failure to accept fuel. The opposite is true. The bill provides early receipt as soon as construction is authorized. That is as early as 2006, January. It permits the Secretary of Energy to enter into settlement agreements with utilities, thus limiting continued liability. I think this is another example of the administration putting responsibility for its own problems on Congress. They seek to minimize damages from their own failure to take the waste and minimize the $40 to $80 billion liability by cooperating with Congress. Is that too much to ask? I ask my colleagues to explain to their constituencies why they are exposing them to continued litigation at the expense of the taxpayer, as the $40 to $80 billion claims against the Federal Government continues to mount. 
   Another argument is S. 1287 doesn't promote settlement because it doesn't have ``take title'' language. Mr. President, one time it had take title language but the Secretary of Energy, Secretary Richardson, didn't do his part to gain support from the States that opposed it. Why did the States oppose it? They feared the Federal Government would simply leave the waste in their States, take title to it and leave it. More importantly, the DOE has argued in the past; the Ninth Circuit, in 1991, said that the Department of Energy already had the authority to take title. That was granted by the 1954 Atomic Energy Act. This is another smokescreen. 
   What is lacking is not legal authority but a political exercise of will. This administration, unfortunately, does not have that political will.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. He states:  
   Today's veto of the nuclear waste bill is an important step to protect the health, safety, and the environment.  
   He is saying the President's veto is in the interest of protecting health, safety, and the environment. He is saying leave it at those sites in the 40 States. That must be what he is saying. 
   He says:  
   This legislation was rejected because it does nothing to assist in conducting the best scientific research into the ..... Yucca Mountain site..... .  
   What are the EPA, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the National Academy of Sciences? That is the best science we have, and yet he says there is no science involved in this process. 
   He says:  
   ..... the legislation limits the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency to set appropriate radiation ..... standards.  
   That is contrary to reality. It does not. We do give that authority to the EPA. 
   He further says:  
   I believe we need to find a permanent solution for the disposal--  
   We all agree we need a permanent solution, but the Vice President does not suggest any permanent solution. He says we ought to have one. 
   We have spent almost $7 billion digging a hole out of Yucca Mountain and, in 1998, the ratepayers have paid $16 billion to the Federal Government to take the waste. Now the taxpayers, as a consequence of the inability of the Federal Government to live under the terms of that contract, are looking at a liability exposure of $40 billion to $80 billion. 
   When the Vice President makes that kind of a statement, I wonder what he is talking about--we need to find a permanent solution. This is a permanent solution for disposal of the high-level nuclear waste and is one based on the best science available to protect public health and the environment. 
   This is just another issue of politics. Obviously, there is a certain sensitivity about overriding any President's veto, but there is a recognition of and an obligation to do what is in the interest of the taxpayers and of protecting those 80 sites in 40 States where this waste is stored and getting on with the obligation. 
   What concerns me more than anything is the reality that at some point in time we may find ourselves in a position where we simply are unable to come to grips with this matter. I am going to quote one of my friends from Nevada who, in a February 9 press release, indicated a key victory on the nuclear waste bill. It is entitled, ``Senators Secure Votes Needed to Sustain Presidential Veto.'' 
   The interesting paragraph reads, under a criticism of S. 1287:  
   The Environmental Protection Agency will have full authority to set radiation standards for Yucca Mountain which many experts say will ultimately prevent--  
   Ultimately prevent--  
   the site from ever being licensed as a nuclear waste dump.  
   Make no mistake about this, there is a conscientious effort by many people who are antinuclear to simply stop the nuclear industry in its tracks by making sure there is no permanent repository for that waste. The sequence of what will happen is these reactor sites are licensed for a certain capacity. When that capacity fills up, those plants have to shut down, and we can bid goodbye to the nuclear industry. The problem is the administration and those 
   who oppose it have not suggested an alternative as to where we are going to pick up the power. 
   It is fair to say the ultimate objective of some people is to ensure that Yucca Mountain is never used, others never want to see a permanent repository built, regardless of where it is. In deference to my good friends from Nevada, clearly they do not want it in their State under any terms and circumstances. 
   That is the posture of where we are, but we do have an opportunity today to bring this matter to a head by overriding the President's veto and getting on with the business at hand. 
   I have used a good deal of time this morning. I yield the floor to the other side. First, how much time have I used?

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I want to point out a couple of things. I saw my friend from California on the floor a few moments ago. I guess she intends to speak. 
   Let me point out something that I think is paramount as we address this matter. That is the reality of where this waste is and where this waste is coming in. 
   I think it is important to note that San Francisco is obviously key because just up from the area of Sacramento and the Sacramento River is Concord, CA. Concord, CA, is unique inasmuch as it has been designated by the Clinton administration as one of the major west coast ports for receiving high-level nuclear waste under the Foreign Research Reactor Program. 
   It is kind of interesting because over a 13-year period some portion of 20 tons of spent nuclear fuel from 41 countries will be shipped to the United States for storage, and a good portion of that will come into Concord, CA. Once it gets into Concord, CA, it will be shipped from the Concord Naval Weapons Station in California, and it will follow a route up to Idaho. That shipment will either go by rail or truck. 
   I think it is significant to recognize the reality that we move waste. The waste moves in areas that are prone to earthquakes. California certainly is. California has four nuclear reactors currently: San Onofre, Rancho Seco--and one which is shut down. Here is another opportunity for the waste to simply stay at the shutdown reactor, or move almost 20 percent of California's electricity which comes from nuclear energy. 
   I might add that the residents of California have paid $762 million into a nuclear waste fund. That is three-quarters of a billion dollars. 
   In 1998, nuclear reactors avoided about 5.35 million metric tons of CO2 emissions. Have they helped with the greenhouse gases? Since 1983, the total avoided greenhouse emissions are 83 million metric tons. These are to be avoided as a consequence of the contribution of nuclear power in California. During 1998, nuclear power avoided 878 tons of sulfur dioxide in California. 
   If indeed my friend from California intends to speak on this issue, I would certainly encourage her to address the concerns of California being chosen as the West Coast recipient for the transfer of waste from the 41 countries and some 20 tons of spent fuel. 
   On the east coast, the Charleston Naval Weapons Station in South Carolina will be the recipient of waste moving by rail and truck. 
   This is pertinent to the discussion at hand. We have heard in detail the question of the important agenda before the Senate, whether we are talking about juvenile justice, protecting Medicare or Patients' Bill of Rights. These are all important issues, but so is this. It is important we get this issue behind us. It is costing the taxpayers a good deal every day it goes unresolved--$40 to $80 billion in liability. That continues to increase as a consequence of the Nation's inability to honor the sanctity of the contracts. 
   I urge my colleagues to reflect on the importance of this bill, the importance of this legislation, and not be misled. It is meaningful to the taxpayers of this country that we vote today to override the President's veto. 
   How much time remains on this side?

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank Senator GRAMS for his statement, particularly for highlighting the risk we face in not acting, inasmuch as some of our plants that anticipated having Yucca Mountain available for permanent storage, indeed, are in danger. 
   Maryland, for example, has two reactors at Calvert Cliffs producing over 13,000 kilowatts a year. They provide 26 percent of the clean electricity for the State of Maryland. The consumers in Maryland have paid $337 million into the nuclear waste fund since 1982. There are 741 metric tons stored there, and it is short term. It is temporary because, when they built that plant, they were looking at Yucca Mountain as a permanent storage. Indeed, there is genuine concern about the ability to maintain this very clean source of energy if, indeed, we do not act in this body and override the President's veto. 
   Before we break, I wish to take my colleagues through a brief summary of the inconsistencies of this administration with regard to transportation. 
   In 1996, the Clinton administration agreed to participate in the Foreign Research Reactor Program where, over a 13-year period, some 20 tons of spent nuclear fuel from 41 countries will be shipped to the United States for storage. It goes into Concord, CA, and up to Idaho on railroads and highways. It goes into Savannah River and is moved there through the rail system, as well as highways. 
   At the Savannah River site in South Carolina, as well as the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, this waste is moved, depending on whether it comes from the west coast or east coast--shipment comes in on freighters through the Charleston Naval Weapons Station in South Carolina and the Concord Naval Weapons Station in California--the spent fuel is transported from the ship to a final designation by either rail or truck.  Shall we leave it in California? Shall we leave it in South Carolina? 
   The President mentions the importance of nonproliferation goals that a central repository will meet and that the nonproliferation for these shipments of foreign spent fuel is a good one. We do not want terrorists or rogue governments coming into possession of these weapons, but let's look at reality. 
   For example, when the program started in 1996, we were faced with transporting spent fuel from a reactor in Bogota, Colombia. The spent fuel was moved from the reactor, loaded into a shipping cask, placed into a semitractor trailer truck for shipment, and then what did we do? We went to the Russians. 
   We chartered a Russian Antonov AN-124 airplane large enough to carry tanks and helicopters and drove the semi aboard the plane and flew the shipment to the seaport city of Cartagena and placed it on a freighter. It then joined spent fuel already loaded from Chile. It was delivered to the Charleston weapons center where it was loaded on railcars to Savannah River. 
   This was the Department of Energy acting to pull out all stops, sparing no expense to complete this important shipment. Administration policy then is to take nuclear fuel from foreign nations flying, shipping, and trucking all over the world and storing it at military facilities, and even building interim storage sites in the United States, but this administration will not address the waste generated by the domestic nuclear power industry; it will not reconcile a policy to address this in a responsible manner. It would rather leave it at the 40 States in 80 sites. That is what this administration proposes to do. It is unconscionable at a time when we are looking to the nuclear energy for roughly 20 percent of the power generated in the United States, and this administration does not accept its responsibility. That is why I urge all my colleagues to look at this realistically: Do we want the waste concentrated where it is in temporary storage, or do we want it in a permanent repository where we have already expended some $7 billion to place it? 
   I believe my time has expired or is about to expire.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. In a minute and a half, I note the Senator from California showed a beautiful picture of Death Valley. I will show you a beautiful picture of the proposed location of the repository out at Yucca Mountain. 
   This is it. It is not very pretty. We have had 800 nuclear weapons tests in the last 50 years. That is the area we are talking about. 
   Some suggest, why are we talking about this when we have other more important things to do? This is an obligation of this Congress. The House has acted. It is up to the Senate to act now and move this legislation over the President's veto. 
   This is important. This costs the taxpayers money. We have an obligation. Furthermore, this is the pending business of the Senate at this time because the House voted. It went down to the President. The President vetoed it. It is the standing order of business before this body. So it is most appropriate that we resolve this matter today. 
   I encourage my colleagues this afternoon to vote to override the President's veto. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to point out a couple of things. We can show all the pictures we want around here about ``what if's'' but the facts remain. There was no nuclear waste associated with that particular photograph of the unfortunate train wreck. 
   Let's talk a little bit about how this is stored. There have been 1,500 tests performed to confirm and approve container safety. In the Nuclear Regulatory Commission tests, transportation canisters have been subject to some very tough tests, as they should be, tests that confirmed that they did not break open. They survived a 30-foot free-fall onto an unyielding surface, which is the same as a crash into a concrete bridge abutment at 120 miles an hour. Puncture tests, as well, were done, allowing the container to fall 40 inches onto a steel rod 6 inches in diameter; 
   30 minutes in a fire of 1,475 degrees that engulfs the whole container; submerging the container under 3 feet of water for 8 hours. It goes on and on. It is rather interesting to note, about 10 years ago we were looking at flying nuclear waste for reprocessing from Japan to France. At that time, the requirement was to design a cask that would withstand a free-fall from 30,000 feet. We were advised it was technically available. 
   What we have here is almost a Nevada litmus test. Everyone has to be against Yucca Mountain. I know there is a good deal of pressure on Members, out of allegiance to my good friends from Nevada, from those who do not want the waste in their State. That is the bottom line. If they have to kill the nuclear waste industry to achieve it, that is what will happen. 
   I am holding a copy of the U.S. Navy Nuclear Propulsion Program. This is the so-called ``Mobile Chernobyl,'' some 90 reactors moving all over the world. It is entitled ``Over 117 Million Miles Safely Steamed on Nuclear Power.'' That is the record of our Navy. What we are hearing today is nothing but fear tactics of the worst kind, and this is emanated by the veto of the President. 
   Let's be realistic; the EPA has the sole and final authority to issue a radiation standard. I do not want to hear any Member reinterpreting that any other way. They--the EPA--must set forth a scientific basis for the rule. That is the best science. On June 1, 2001, they--meaning the EPA--are free to issue whatever standard they deem appropriate. They have the final say. We can only hope it makes a sensible and achievable interpretation and is based on sound science. 
   We talk about the science. In the President's veto message, he talks about the science. The Vice President talks about the science. We are talking about the best science--the EPA, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the National Academy of Sciences, with the EPA having the sole and final authority. There is absolutely no question about that if you read the bill. 
   Let's look at something else. Taking the waste is a Federal responsibility, the sanctity of a contract. The deadline was 1998. The ratepayers have paid $16 billion to the Federal Government to take that waste. The taxpayers have spent some $6 billion already at Yucca Mountain where we have the hole in which to put the waste. 
   The longer the delay, the more liability the Federal Government has for not taking the waste because the utilities are suing the Federal Government for not taking the waste. That is some $40 billion to $80 billion. It is estimated it will cost each taxpaying family in the United States $1,300. 
   I will talk about foreign-domestic transportation. We have seen 300 safe domestic shipments over the last 30 years--no injury, no radiation. This chart shows the network all over the country. Since 1996, transport of foreign reactor fuel has come into this country from 41 other nations. That is over 20 tons over the next 13 years. 
   To where does it go? It goes into Concord, CA, Sacramento River, and moves up to Idaho. On the east coast, it goes to the Charleston Naval Weapons Center by rail up to Savannah River, and by truck on the highways. It is shipped as high-level waste from other countries. In the debate, the Senators from Nevada never acknowledged that exists. They never acknowledged there is an inconsistency in our policy. 
   We accept it from foreign governments, and we store it in 
   the United States, but this administration will not address its obligation to take the domestically produced waste from our own utilities and the ratepayers have paid the Government to take it. That is the inconsistency. That is what is wrong with the administration's policy. 
   One example of this is U.S. participation in foreign shipments. A semi truck full of spent fuel was loaded into a chartered Russian Antonov AN-124 cargo plane and flown from Bogota, Colombia, to Cartagena so it could join a shipment from Chile bound for Charleston by freighter. The flight was believed to be necessary to avoid terrorists in Colombia, and the shipment went off without a hitch. 
   The point of this message is obvious. We are doing it for foreign nations. We are shipping it all over the world to two places in the United States: Concord, CA, and Charleston, SC. I do not know if the Senators from those States are concerned about it. I do not see them speaking on the floor about it in indignation. Do we want to leave the spent fuel at 80 sites in 40 States, as this chart shows? That is the alternative. 
   I leave all Members with one thought. Putting politics aside, how will you as a Senator explain why today you voted to leave the waste in your State, subjecting your taxpayers to continued liability for broken promises of this administration? 
   I urge my colleagues to vote to override the President's veto. Let's put this issue behind us once and for all. If we do not, it will come back at a greater cost to the taxpayers. 
   Finally, on the issue of health and safety, about which we have heard so much from our good friends from Nevada, this waste is spread out at 80 sites in 40 States, as I have indicated. I have another chart which shows that. These might be determined to be 80 mini Yucca Mountains, but they were not designed for permanent storage. They were designed for short-term storage, just as we have seen at Calvert Cliffs in Maryland. The current onsite storage was designed for short-term storage, not long-term storage. 
   In conclusion, I encourage my colleagues to remember that in the 1999 Department of Energy draft EIS report, it said:  
   Leaving the waste onsite represents considerable human health risks as opposed to one central remote facility in the Nevada desert.  
   That is a statement by this administration relative to the issue of health and safety and leaving this waste where it is in these 40 States at these 80 sites. 
   Again, I encourage my colleagues to reflect on what they are going to say to their constituents when they go home and say, I guess I voted to leave the waste in my State, when, indeed, they had an obligation and an opportunity to move it to one central facility that has been selected at Yucca Mountain, an area where we had 800 nuclear weapons tests over a 50-year period and where we did our experimentation with the nuclear bomb--an area, frankly, that is probably already so polluted that it can never be cleaned up. 
   I ask my colleagues to read the letter, which is printed earlier in the  RECORD, from Governor George E. Pataki, who indicated that the citizens of New York State have been forced to temporarily store more than 2,000 tons of radioactive waste and urged the President to sign this bill into law, and the statement that disposal of this waste is one of the most important environmental concerns facing New York and other States with nuclear facilities. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as we wind down our debate, I compliment my friends from Nevada for their points of view. But I would like to remind all of my colleagues of the obligations we have. 
   Senator DURBIN from Illinois expressed concern about why we are waiting until 2001. 
   We are all very much aware that this administration and the Environmental Protection Agency came down today without a doubt to set a standard that was unattainable. Make no mistake about it, that is what some of these folks would like to see happen. 
   I quote from the press release of my friend, Senator REID, of February 9:  
   Under this bill, the Environmental Protection Agency will have full authority to set radiation standards for Yucca Mountain, which many experts say will ultimately prevent the site from ever being licensed as a nuclear waste dump.  
   There you have it. They don't want to ever see it accomplish its purpose. 
   We talk about courage. We talk about health. We talk about safety. But the real issue is politics, and it is Nevada politics against the recognition of the rest of the country that we have this waste at 80 sites in 40 States, and this administration is simply caving in to Nevada politics. 
   Let me talk about courage. 
   It is going to take courage to tell your constituents the money they paid to move the waste has been taken by the Federal Government and the waste is still not moved. 
   It is going to take courage to tell your constituents the Federal Government has broken its word again, and you support 
   that Government, you support that decision, and you support the President who tells you he has justification for overriding the veto. 
   It takes courage to tell your constituents you think this waste is safer near their homes, their schools, their hospitals, and their playgrounds than it is in one site in Nevada. 
   It takes courage to tell your constituents to ignore the findings of the administration's draft EIS that found that leaving the material spread around the country would ``represent a considerable health risk.'' 
   There you have it. There you have the capsule of what this is all about. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote to override the President's veto and to meet our obligation as Senators to resolve this problem once and for all. 
   I thank the Chair. 
   Again, I thank my colleagues on the other side of the issue.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to salute the achievements of a man who has dedicated most of his life to improving the quality and safety of Alaskan and Pacific Northwest seafood, and whose efforts have made a positive and permanent impact on America's food industry. 
   Roger DeCamp is by no means a household name. Roger has never sought recognition or fame. Yet it is not too much to say that he has made a profound contribution to the welfare of America's seafood consumers. 
   In just a few short weeks, Roger DeCamp will retire as the Director of the National Food Processors Association Northwest Laboratory, in Seattle, Washington. 
   In 1960, Roger joined the Association as a microbiology and processing engineer. In 1964, he moved to Seattle to become the head of the microbiology and thermal processing division at the Northwest facility, and in 1971, he became the assistant director for the entire facility. He has been the director since 1981. 
   Unlike some who achieve senior positions, Roger has not ceased his work ``in the trenches.'' He has remained accessible to anyone who needed his assistance, and as one of the most knowledgeable individuals in the world about seafood quality control and safety, his advice has been widely sought. 
   One of the major achievements in Roger's career has been the modernization and direction of the Canned Salmon Control Plan, which assures the safety and integrity of the millions and millions of pounds of canned salmon produced annually in Alaska, and which is shipped worldwide. Canned salmon is one of the United States' most successful seafood exports. That success owes a great deal to the control plan, which gives buyers everywhere the confident knowledge that American canned salmon is a wholesome and beneficial protein source. 
   Under Roger's direction, the Canned Salmon Control Plan, with participation from industry, the Food and Drug Administration, and the National Food Processors Association, received the Vice-Presidential Hammer award for its unique approach to meeting the highly complex, technical, and sometimes conflicting requirements of the industry and the government agencies that regulate it. 
   Roger has continually worked to modernize the practices and procedures of the industry, and has represented it with distinction in the development of regulatory guidelines at both the state and federal levels. 
   He provided much of the impetus and expertise that led to the development of new Alaska seafood inspection regulations, has counseled the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute technical committee on seafood quality since its creation in 1981, and led the development of the Hazard Analysis/Critical Control Point approach to seafood processing. The latter revolutionized seafood safety requirements, and when put in place in Alaska, became the model on which later federal regulations were constructed for seafood products nationwide. This same technical approach is now being applied not just to seafoods, but to meats and other products as well. 
   Roger also has been active on international trade issues of critical importance to the seafood industry. Among other things, he played a crucial role in obtaining agreement on a method of certifying seafood for the European Union market without resorting to the imposition of new user fees on the industry. 
   Finally, it must be noted that the respect in which Roger is been held by both the industry and by government regulators has been key to the successful negotiation of scientific and technical agreements between the industry and the Food and Drug Administration, to the maintenance of a strong working relationship between them, and to the federal agency's willingness to work cooperatively on even the most complex and technical issues of food handling and safety. 
   In no small way, both his industry and his country owe a debt of thanks to Roger DeCamp.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Stephen S.F. Chen, who serves as the head of the Taipei Cultural and Economic Representative Office in Washington, DC. 
   Ambassador Chen will be retiring from diplomatic service and returning to his home in Taiwan soon. I have come to know Ambassador Chen well since his appointment in October of 1997, as have many of my colleagues, and hold him in high regard for his unquestioned professionalism and personal integrity. 
   Ambassador Chen has, for forty years, ably represented his government in posts throughout the world. His experience in the United States is extensive. During the past twenty-five years Ambassador Chen has served in Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. Over the years, Ambassador Chen has become a friend to numerous Americans, myself included. It is fitting in many ways that he closes his diplomatic career here in Washington, among friends. 
   Mr. President, representing the people of Taiwan abroad is a challenge of great magnitude. The people of Taiwan live in an admirably democratic, free and dynamic community at home. They are significantly more constrained in the international community. Effectively communicating the interests of Taiwan abroad requires considerable diplomatic skill, patience and resolve. Stephen Chen embodies all these traits. 
   The people of Taiwan could not have had a better Ambassador in Washington, D.C., than Stephen Chen. I will certainly miss my good friend when he leaves and know my colleagues will join me in extending to him our best wishes and great appreciation.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to recognize a recent achievement of the men and women at Elmendorf Air Force Base in Anchorage, Alaska. Today, they received the Air Force's 1999 General Thomas D. White Environmental Award for Restoration. This award reflects the commitment of the Air Force in Anchorage to making Elmendorf Air Force Base and the surrounding community a better place to live. 
   Mr. President, the men and women who serve our nation at Elmendorf have always been sensitive to the needs of the communities surrounding the base. Indeed, all of the Air Force installations in Alaska, have gone out of their way to ensure that the environment is not permanently harmed by any military presence. Innovative approaches to cleanup have resulted in Elmendorf being projected to reach Air Force cleanup goals a full ten years ahead of schedule. 
   Several measures are in place to improve and speed up the cleanup of any future environmental hazards, all at a cost savings of over $1 million to the taxpayers. All of these efforts have ensured a long standing positive relationship with the civilian community and preserved the beautiful lands in Alaska for future generations to enjoy. For this reason, the Air Force today rewarded the men and women at Elmendorf for their diligence. 
   Today, the people of Elmendorf can be proud of the fact that they are an example by which other Air Force installations around the nation, indeed the world, will measure themselves for environmental awareness. I join the Air Force in commending those at Elmendorf, like Lieutenant General Thomas R. Case and Colonel Duncan H. Showers, who have made this possible. I also look forward to continued work with the Air Force in Alaska to maintain their excellent relationship with the rest of the communities in Alaska.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill with my colleague, Senator TED STEVENS, to provide a tremendously important authorization for an electrical intertie for an isolated region of my State of Alaska. As many of my colleagues know, Alaska has many unique problems. We are over twice the size of Texas, with fewer miles of paved roads than the District of Columbia. Most of our communities are unconnected. The results of this are stark for those in unconnected communities, and have significant impacts on their lives. Energy costs and reliance upon fossil fuels for power generation are just some of these impacts. 
   The vast majority of these towns and villages pay very high energy costs. In some instances, these costs exceed 38 cents per kilowatt hour. This makes the cost of living almost unbearable for many local residents. For example, the village of Kake, Alaska pays 38 cents per kilowatt hour and has 38 percent unemployment. Unlike in the rest of the country, when unemployment strikes a particular unconnected community in Alaska, the option to drive to employment in a neighboring community does not exist. One either stays in a devastated community or sells one's home in a market of sellers under duress. With electrical rates running three times and above those in most of the U.S., few will invest in these communities. 
   Mr. President, I refer Members to the latest study of economic situation in Southeast Alaska. The report deals with the economic impact of declining timber harvests in Southeast Alaska. This is not intended to restart the debate over that issue. That is for another forum. However, what the report vividly describes is the drastic 
    decline in the economy of this region. In the last decade, known by most of the country as the greatest boom in the century, Southeast Alaska has lost 2900 jobs and over $100 million in payroll. Many of these communities have suffered losses in population. For example, the Wrangell/Petersburg area has suffered a 13 percent loss in wage and salary income; my hometown of Ketchikan suffered a similar 12 percent loss. Personal income is down from 5 to 11 percent in the region generally. The problem for Southeast Alaska is that it has no viable option for a replacement industry. 
   In other areas of the country, such as the Pacific Northwest, alternative employment such as high tech companies  in Oregon and Washington have replaced honorable livelihoods in resource-based industries. There has been no comparable replacement industry for Southeast Alaska. There are a number of reasons, but the biggest reason is lack of affordable power for most communities. 
   Mr. President, in the Pacific Northwest, power costs are reasonable and the Bonneville Power Administration has an efficient and modern distribution system. In the lower 48 generally, every village and town is connected by power grid to the rest of the nation. That is not the case in Southeast Alaska. This lack of connection exacerbates the situation. 
   However, what can be done is to interconnect the region. By doing this, the existing and potential clean energy sources can be maximized and the power can be managed between communities and other users. Right now, one hydroelectric facility, Lake Tyee has tremendous excess capacity to bring clean and cheaper energy to many villages. This has been proven in a study conducted by the Southeast Conference. The Southeast Conference is the group of Mayors representing communities throughout Southeast Alaska. This study, entitled the Southeast Alaska Electrical Intertie System Plan, outlines the regional grid which this bill authorizes. 
   Mr. President, let me be clear, this is only an authorization. The bill provides no obligation to the Federal government to be involved in the construction of this intertie system whatsoever. 
   The bill also does not authorize nor does it contemplate that the federal government will exercise any ownership or management responsibility over this system. In fact, the Southeast communities which have asked me to introduce this bill seek to manage this project themselves. 
   It simply provides an authorization for the Congress to assist the communities in assemblying funding for the project. There is ample precedent for this. In fact, this very process was used successfully in Arizona and Utah with the Central Arizona and Central Utah projects. The era of the federal government constructing, owning and operating new power generation facilities has passed. However, the federal government can provide valuable assistance to a group of communities which seek to get their region back on the road to economic recovery. This is a good bill because it encourages local self reliance. 
   Mr. President, an intertie can do so much to assist this region. Right now, we have a series of isolated communities which cannot even work with each other on power issues. Each must provide its own generation and transmission facilities. And almost all of these facilities use diesel oil-fired generation because that is the only type of self-contained transmission facility which these communities can afford. Instead with an intertie, these generators can be put in mothballs and used only for isolated emergency backup. The intertie will provide reliable and clean sources of energy for all these communities. 
   I am informed by the communities that they intend to form a state chartered regional power authority to manage this Intertie. It will have no federal budgetary obligation. Additionally, the intertie will help the environment by shifting these small villages from their diesel generation and pointing them towards clean, renewable fuel sources. All of these facilities will be subject to all federal, state, and local laws including environmental laws. Just to make sure that this is clear, I have included a specific provision in the bill that reaffirms that this simple authorization will not affect, change, or alter any obligations under federal laws such as the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). All of the facilities will be subject to normal permitting. 
   There will undoubtedly be environmental studies required for the different components. For example, part of phase 1 of the Intertie includes the Swan Lake-Lake Tyee project which will connect my hometown of Ketchikan to its neighbors to the north, Wrangell and Petersburg. The permits for this project are already in place and were issued by the Forest Service as a result of a laborious 2 year NEPA study. The Forest Service issued a full Environmental Impact Statement which resulted in a favorable record of decision. No corners were cut and the project was approved by the Forest Service and permits issued. This bill will have no effect on that process. Any other phases will have to undergo close scrutiny, although I am convinced that connecting communities together using renewable hydropower will be much better environmentally than continued reliance on transporting, storing and burning high-priced diesel. 
   Mr. President, Alaska was not even a state when the major transmission systems were built in this country in the 1930's, 1940's and 1950's. Until World War II compelled the heroic construction of the Alcan Highway. Alaska was not even connected by road to the rest of the country. Alaska was never even considered as a candidate for the construction of a transmission system. Alaska's economic development is in its infancy even today. A project like the Southeast Regional Intertie is necessary to give that region of Alaska the opportunity to recover from the economic disaster outlined in the McDowell report. It is my intention to have this bill considered by my committee soon and I hope to report it favorably to the Senate floor in the near future.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we have a number of bills from my Committee on the Calendar that are ready for consideration, but I want to take a moment to say a few words about a bill I think has real potential for addressing the long-term energy needs of our nation. H.R. 1753, the Methane hydrate Research and Development Act of 2000, would establish a small research program with the potential for a major payoff--energy security for the foreseeable future. Methane Hydrates are rigid, ice-like solids of water surrounding a gas molecule, found at low temperatures and high pressures. When melted or depressurized, they release methane, pure natural gas, the same fuel we use to heat our homes and power our economy. 
   Significant quantities of methane hydrates have been detected all over the world. In the U.S., marine geologists have detected deposits of methane hydrates in deep sea sediments that lie off the coasts of the Carolinas, Louisiana, Texas, California, Oregon, and my home state of Alaska. We've also detected methane hydrates under the permafrost during conventional oil drilling operations in my home state of Alaska. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that nearly 320,000 trillion cubic feet of natural gas can be extracted from the methane hydrates found in the U.S. alone. Compare that to our existing reserves of cheap, clean natural gas--1,300 trillion cubic feet--and our annual use of natural gas--just 20 trillion cubic feet per year. Even if we can learn to recover just 1 percent of our methane hydrate reserves, we will more than triple our available natural gas reserves and guarantee a source of cheap, secure and clean energy for the next century and well beyond. 
   The problem is: we need fundamental research on these hydrates to understand how they form, and how the gas molecule can be released in a way that we can use. Even now, methane hydrates pose hazards to conventional oil and gas recovery. Hydrates determine the stability and strength of the sea floor--when the hydrates are destabilized, the resulting gas release can undermine oil platforms and sink drilling ships. Methane hydrates release 160 volumes of gas for every volume of hydrate--and many existing hydrate formations are very unstable. Even a small disturbance--an unintentional landslide--could release massive quantities of gas. Oil platforms in the Caspian Sea have been destroyed as a result of this kind of accidental release. 
   Methane hydrates also play a significant role in global climate change. Recent scientific research suggests that abrupt climate changes have occurred in the past as a result of release of methane gas from hydrates. They are an important 
   part of the global carbon cycle, which we must ultimately understand in detail if we want to act responsibly to address the risk of climate change. Since natural gas releases fewer carbon atoms per unit of energy, replacing coal and oil usage with natural gas from methane hydrates also reduces our risk of climate change--some experts estimate we can reduce our carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent just by fuel substitution alone. We can also learn about carbon sequestration through studying how methane hydrates form--perhaps even replacing methane hydrates used for energy with hydrates using carbon dioxide sequestered from the atmosphere. 
   All of these things point to the need for a fundamental methane hydrate research program of the kind proposed in this bill. I want to thank my good friends and colleagues on the Energy Committee, Senators AKAKA and CRAIG, for their leadership and recognition of the potential for methane hydrates to satisfy our future energy needs, enable our long-term energy security, and help us responsibly address the risk of climate change. Working with our colleagues in the House, we have been able to develop legislation that would authorize $45 million in new funding for research in this important area. Anticipating passage of a bill like this one, the Department of Energy has prepared an excellent multi-year research and development program plan that addresses all of the issues involved--with the goal of safe commercial production of energy from hydrates by 2010. 
   It is clear that we are not doing enough to explore the possibility of this exciting new energy source. Other nations of the world--Japan, Canada, India, Korea and Norway--are starting ambitious research programs. The Japanese began a drilling project of their own in November 1999, and expect that production can begin within 10 years, maybe sooner. The technology exists--Syntroleum, an Oklahoma company--has recently acquired a patent for a gas hydrate recovery system. All we need now is the sustained research to make it commercially viable. 
   For those reasons, Mr. President, I am glad that my colleagues here in the  Senate will agree to pass the bill in the form passed by the House two weeks ago, so we can send it to the President for signature and get going on this important research program. Thanks to the leadership of Senators AKAKA and CRAIG, we may look back years from now on this day as the day we broke free of our dependence on foreign oil and guaranteed ourselves a clean energy source for many years to come.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send to the desk, for appropriate reference, legislation submitted by the administration to increase the authorization of appropriations for the Bureau of Reclamation's Safety of Dams program. Let me emphasize that I am introducing this legislation at the request of the administration. Neither I nor any other member of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources has taken a position on the merits of the legislation at this time. I understand some water users have expressed concerns with this legislation, and I want to assure them that the Water and Power Subcommittee, to which this bill will be referred, will have a hearing on the legislation so that they can make their concerns a part of the record and address them in the legislative process. Ensuring the safety of dams under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Reclamation is very important but is must be done in a way that ensures safety at Reclamation facilities while not causing undue financial hardship for project beneficiaries. I ask unanimous consent that the letter of transmittal from the administration and a section-by-section of the legislation that the administration prepared be printed in the RECORD.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we have started our debate, and later this afternoon we will have a vote on the disposition of the waiver of the gas tax. 
   Upon arriving on the floor, I had the opportunity to hear the remarks of the Senator from California relative to an issue we have discussed on previous occasions; that is, the export of petroleum, energy products. I think the generalization was that she was concerned with the export from the State of Alaska of some 60,000 barrels a day of oil product. 
   As I have explained on this floor before, the export of our oil product, which is surplus to the west coast, has been carried on by one company that had that access, British Petroleum. British Petroleum has since acquired the non-Alaska segment of ARCO, which includes a number of refineries. BP did not have refineries on the west coast. I have introduced a letter in the RECORD from BP indicating they will curtail exports of Alaskan oil at the end of this month. I also have a letter from Phillips, which has acquired ARCO Alaska, and it is not their intent to export Alaskan oil. 
   I hope that addresses and resolves the issue and satisfies the concerns of those who continually bring this up in spite of my explanation.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, if OPEC decides to cut back its increased production by one-third, then where are we? We are right back where we were before OPEC made the decision to raise production. 
   Think about that--full circle. 
   I spoke before the ocean industries this morning and expressed my concern. The Secretary of Energy, the Honorable Bill Richardson, spoke before me. I don't think he was able to convey much of a feeling of assurance that, indeed, we had this issue of an energy crisis under control. 
   If OPEC makes the decision to raise production, I think we have to go back and examine the deal the Secretary made with OPEC. That is rather interesting. I think we need to because OPEC never really increased their production by 1.5 or 1.7 million barrels. If you factor in the reality that OPEC was cheating, what really happened on or before March 27 was OPEC's actual increase of production was a bare 500,000 barrels a day. That is what we really got. 
   The rationale for that is the recognition, if you read the agreement, that they acknowledge they were posting in the cartel a production of 23 million barrels a day. They were cheating and  put out 24.2 million barrels a day. When the administration announced that it was going to get an additional 1.7 million barrels a day, they didn't take into account the reality that they were already cheating by 1.2 million barrels a day. If you subtract 1.2 from 1.7, you get 500,000 barrels a day. That is actually what we got. 
   In that case, we are right back where we started before OPEC met. 
   Do not be misled, my colleagues. All of that doesn't go to the United States. There are other customers of OPEC. We traditionally get 16 percent of our crude oil from OPEC. By the time you look at the allotments of the other countries, it is estimated that out of 500,000 barrels, the U.S. gets somewhere in the area of 75,000 to 88,000 barrels. 
   Furthermore, if you look at what we consume in the general metropolitan area of Washington, DC, and its extensions, it is about 121,000 barrels a day. 
   We haven't gotten anything. We are almost assured that we will see higher gasoline prices this summer. 
   For that reason alone, I believe we should give relief now to the American motorists by rolling back the Gore gas tax. 
   Yesterday, I indicated that 74 percent of the American people think that the 4.3 cents per gallon should be temporarily lifted.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is not just the American motorists who want to see gas taxes come down. There are business organizations, especially small businesses, that have been hit hard by the fuel price jump. Their businesses are being devastated. 
   I have a letter of support from the National Federation of Independent Businesses which represents more than 600,000 small businesses in America. In their letter, they cite the fuel price hike and what it has meant to an average small business. 
   I quote:  
   For a small company that consumes 50,000 gallons of diesel fuel in a month, the increase it prices in the past year will cost that company an additional $40,000 per month. If fuel prices remain high, these costs could eventually be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for many goods and services. A 4.3 cent reduction in the cost of fuel would save the company more than $2,000 per month.  
   The Independent Truckers Association also sent a letter of its support to our legislation.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I quote from this letter. It says:  
   It is important to recognize that truckers, not just the independents and small fleets, but the whole industry, work on a very small profit margin. So the recent increase in oil prices by OPEC, along with the failed energy policies of the Clinton/Gore administration, strikes deep in the heart and wallet of American truckers. Enacting Senate bill 2285, the Federal Fuels Tax Holiday Act, today will help those injured by excessive oil and fuel prices and will help keep the economy rolling along.  
   I also have a letter of support from the National Food Processors Association.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, many Americans accepted the gas tax  increase because they believed that the money would go to rebuilding and expanding the Nation's highway infrastructure. Today, that is exactly how the money is used. But, again, since the 4.3-cent-per-gallon tax was adopted in 1993, not a single penny of that went into, as I said, building a highway or repairing a bridge. When the tax was adopted, it was not earmarked for the highway trust fund. It was instead collected from the motorists, transferred to the Treasury Department, and then spent for whatever programs the Clinton administration wanted. But those programs did not include added highway construction. 
   That changed when Republicans took control of Congress and enacted the 1997 highway bill. Only then did these fuel tax revenues become earmarked for highways, bridges, and mass transit. 
   I know some are concerned legitimately that if we spend these taxes for the remainder of this year, the highway trust fund, which finances roads, bridges, and mass transit, could be in danger. That is a legitimate concern. I am sure it is going to be a concern in the debate that is forthcoming. But I would like to try at least to put those fears to rest. 
   Our legislation is quite specific. If you do not believe that we can pass a bill that ensures something, then the argument is moot. But this legislation ensures that the highway trust fund will not lose a single penny during tax holiday. We require that all moneys that would have anything to do with the fund had the taxes not been suspended be replaced by other Federal revenues. 
   That isn't a free lunch. That is going to be difficult to do. But if this legislation passes, that is what is going to happen. We are going to have to find the money. I hope it will come from on-budget surplus. I would rather see it coming from reducing wasteful Federal programs. 
   Remember. The consumer can't pass it on. He or she can't pass on this increased price to anybody. They are stuck with it. The truckers that came to Washington can't pass it on. If you look at your airline ticket, it is passed on. Nobody can figure out the cost of an airline ticket. If you fly on a Monday or a Tuesday night, it is all different. The fishermen, the farmers--we don't really look at the impact on our economy. The farmer, for example, is dependent on fertilizer. Where does fertilizer come from? It comes from urea. Urea is made out of gas--all petroleum products. We have a multiplier here. 
   We have the difficulty of recognizing that we have become beholden to the Mideast for the sources. 
   I can assure the American motorists that highway construction projects this year and next year will be unaffected by the tax holiday that we are proposing in this legislation. When the trust fund is fully restored, all the projects scheduled for beyond 2002 will be completed. That is in the legislation. 
   The question before the Senate today is simple. Do Senators want to give the American motorists a break at the gas pump when gas prices are high? 
   Again, I refer to the Gallop Poll. Seventy-four percent of Americans say yes; 25 percent of Americans say no. 
   I think we should adopt this temporary tax holiday and invoke cloture on the bill. 
   The rationale is we are giving the American people a choice. We are the elected representatives. Aren't we? What is the priority? Is there a priority to have a choice and a reduction knowing that the highway trust fund is not going to be jeopardized because we are going to have to make it whole? 
   I would like to show you a couple more things before I conclude. 
   This is a picture of the hard, stark reality of where we are today and where we are going. Make no mistake about it. It is a very bleak picture. But it is very real because it shows the world oil balance for the year 2000. 
   It shows where we are currently as we enter the second quarter of the year. 
   We have global demand at 76.8 million barrels a day and global supply at 74. We have the sources of our crude oil, where it comes from in the world, the non-OPEC, Iraqi production, OPEC 10 nations. The point is, in this country today, at the end of the first quarter, we are using reserves. The world is using up its reserves. In other words, the demand is greater than supply, so the world is drawing down about 2 million barrels of its reserve. 
   The projection in the second quarter is interesting. It shows a surplus of 200,000 barrels. The third quarter again draws down reserves of 1.3 million barrels a day. The fourth quarter is worse--2.7 million barrels a day. 
   That is the harsh reality. If things are going to get better, we will have to import more from OPEC or other nations such as Iraq. 
   I conclude with a reminder many people have forgotten relative to the administration's attitude of how we will get relief in this country as we look at various areas of domestic production. One of the most telling is to recognize that currently a significant portion of our activity is coming from the Gulf of Mexico. At the present time, OCS activity is primarily coming off Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama, producing 30 percent of our natural gas and 22 percent our crude oil. That is the OCS. That is in the Gulf of Mexico. 
   I cannot help but note an article on October 23, 1999, from the Metropolitan edition of the Capitol City Press State Times, Morning Advocate, Baton Rouge, LA. Vice President GORE says he will be more antidrilling than any other President. It is significant because it represents the attitude, I think, of this administration and certainly the Vice President as he seeks the Presidency.  
   I will take the most sweeping steps in our history to protect our oceans and coastal waters from offshore oil drilling. 
   I will make sure that there is no new oil leasing off the coast of California and Florida and then I will go much further, I will do everything in my power to make sure there is no new drilling off these sensitive areas even in areas already leased by previous administrations.  
   That is the Vice President saying, if elected President, he in effect would cancel leases leased by previous administrations. 
   It is ironic our Secretary of Energy takes credit for deep-water royalty relief. I worked with Senator Bennett Johnston on that legislation. We got it passed. He takes some credit for it although it didn't pass on his watch. Now the Vice President of the United States wants to undo it. I find that ironic. 
   The last point of irony is we are looking to receive our oil from Iraq. I have a chart showing our increased dependence and what the oil fields look like. It is germane to this debate. Our fastest growing source of imports is Iraq. Many people forget we had a war over there in 1991. We lost 147 American lives in that conflict. We had over 500,000 troops over there. We were over there to make sure Saddam Hussein did not take over the oil fields of Kuwait. That is the harsh fact. Iraq and Saddam Hussein had visions of going into Kuwait, taking over the oil fields, and moving on to Saudi Arabia. That was a war over oil. We fought that battle. 
   This chart demonstrates where we are today. I am outraged. Last year, we imported 300,000 barrels a day from Iraq; we are currently importing 700,000 barrels a day. That is where we are. 
   In addition to the loss of lives and the fact we had nearly 400 wounded and 23 taken prisoner, what has it cost the American taxpayer? The American taxpayer has been hit for over $10 billion in costs in keeping Saddam Hussein fenced in. Imagine that, $10 billion. 
   How many remember what happened when Saddam Hussein was defeated? That is what happened. Take a good look. It shows the burning oil fields of Kuwait he left behind. The fires are raging, and there are Americans trying to cap the wells and get this environmental disaster under control. That is the kind of person we are dealing with. We are looking to them to bail this country out from the standpoint of increasing our imports? This is the policy of this administration? 
   One other thing on which I cannot help but comment. I think it is so ironic, this war is still going on. It is not reported in the Washington press. I don't know if the folks back home know it. An article from March 29, Wednesday, the International News Service, says:  
   U.S. Jets Bomb Iraqi Defense System. 
   U.S. warplanes bombed Iraq air-defense system Wednesday in response to Iraqi artillery fired during their patrol.  
   There is a little more detail in the French newspaper, Agence France Presse, press reports from April 9:   
   U.S. war planes bombed northern Iraq Sunday after coming under Iraqi fire during routine patrols over the northern no-fly zone, the U.S. military said. The aircraft dropped ``ordnance on elements of the Iraqi integrated air defense system'' after Iraqi air forces fired anti-artillery northwest of Musul and west of Bashiqah, the U.S. European command base in Stuttgart, Germany, said. 
   Baghdad said on Thursday that 14 Iraqis were killed and 19 wounded when U.S. and British planes bombed the south of the country, in what was described as the deadliest raid since the beginning of the year. 
   A total of 176 people have been killed in Iraq in US-British bombings since December 1998.  
   Still not much notice. That is a French translation. 
   Here is a Russian translation on the Interfax Russian News, April 10:  
   Moscow Worried Over U.S., Britain Bombing Southern Iraq. 
   The foreign ministry has voiced concern over U.S. bombings of southern Iraq.  
   Baghdad made public its data about the victims of the latest raid, 14 people killed and 19 wounded. 
   How in the world can we justify being at war with Saddam Hussein, increasing our dependence to 700,000 barrels a day, lifting our export ban to give him the technology, which we did 2 weeks ago, to increase his production for his refining capacity even more, and be at war with him? 
   I don't understand this. I think it is outrageous. We have lost 147 lives in the Persian Gulf war. We are really taking his oil, putting it into our airplanes, and going over and bombing. Think about that. 
   Is that the kind of policy we have on energy? Do the American people know what has happened? Do they care? It is unbelievable to me, as we address this issue before us. You might say it is a gas tax. It is the whole issue of lack of an energy policy. We do not have an energy policy for coal. The same clean coal technology supported by this administration--we have seen that. We do not have a nuclear policy. The administration will not address the contractual commitment it made in 1998 to take nuclear waste, although the ratepayers paid the administration $15 billion. That is going to be a legal case of $40 billion to $50 billion when the lawyers are through suing each other. They want to take down the hydrodams. The replacement for that, obviously, is going to put more trucks on the highway in Oregon and Washington if they remove the dams, because so much of the traffic in grains and other produce are moved by barge. 
   Some say gas is the answer, just plug it in. The National Petroleum Council says we are using 21 trillion cubic feet of gas now, and in next 10 years we will be up to 31 trillion. The infrastructure is not there. It is going to take $1.5 trillion to put in that infrastructure. So don't think gas is going to be cheap. And this administration removed 65 percent of the public lands in the overthrust belt, which obviously means there is less area for exploration. 
   So the crunch is coming. I think this administration hopes they will get out of town before this becomes a big political issue in the campaign. But I think it is going to be a big political issue in the campaign. 
   I see many of my colleagues wishing to speak. I again encourage everybody to recognize the attitude of the American people as expressed by this Gallup Poll, which says 74 percent favor elimination of the tax--opposed 23. I had printed the letters of the Independent Truckers Association supporting this, and the NFPA as well, the National Food Processors Association, and the National Federation of Independent Business. We are not talking about jeopardizing the highway trust fund; we are talking about making it whole. We are talking about giving the American people a choice, whether this is a priority for them as represented through their elected representatives--which we are--whether they want relief. It gives us a safety net for the public out there; most of all, a safety net to keep this administration's feet to the fire to ensure that gasoline prices for regular do not go over $2 a gallon, because if they do, then the entire 18.4 cents federal gas tax goes off, it is suspended for the remainder of this year. 
   I think it is a fair trade. I think it is a reasonable compromise. I encourage my colleagues to support the effort and not be misled by the argument that this is going to jeopardize the highway trust fund. It cannot. We have to live by the commitment, if we pass this legislation, to find the money someplace else--out of the surplus, out of reducing wasteful spending, or whatever. That is actually in the legislation.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 1/2 minutes. 
   In this legislation, there is full recovery to the highway trust fund, if indeed  this suspension takes place. There is a balance in it, too. That balance puts the onus on the administration to encourage that the price remain low because if it doesn't and the price goes to $2 a gallon, clearly what will happen is we will eliminate this tax, which is 18.4 cents. 
   The question has been asked, How do we ensure that it is passed on to the consumer? That is a legitimate question. We provide in the legislation a requirement that the GAO audit and make an issue of anyone who breaks the trust that this differential has to be passed on to the consumer. We have the support of the National Food Processors Association, a letter to that effect, and support from the National Foundation of Independent Businesses and the Independent Truckers Association.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Some say this isn't much of a cut. Tell that to the working man or woman who gets up at 4:30 and drives 75 miles one way to work in this city in his pickup because the Government won't let him work at home in the coal mines, or building roads, forests, because they don't support resource development. It might not mean much to the folks who can afford it, but it means a lot to the folks at home. 
   As a consequence, ask the public what they think. It is in a Gallup Poll: 74 percent favor a temporary reduction of the 4.3-cent gas tax. 
   This is a balanced piece of legislation. It is balanced because it would take off the Gore tax. This tax was put on as a consequence of Vice President AL GORE breaking the tie in this body back in 1993. That didn't go into the highway trust fund. That went into the Clinton general fund, and the Clinton administration spent that money as they saw fit. It was the Republican majority in 1998 that turned it around and put it into the highway trust fund. The Clinton administration has enjoyed $21 billion, a windfall they expended out of the general fund for their programs. 
   As Senators look behind the scenes on this one, be careful because reality dictates that this is good for the consumer. The consumers of this Nation want it. Seventy-four percent favor the temporary reduction of the 4.3-cent-a-gallon gas tax. 
   If there is anyone who has been misled by this administration and their opinion of what is going to happen, they should have read the New York Times today. The president of OPEC said today that if the price of the organization's benchmark basket of crude oil remained below $22 a barrel, the 1.5-million-barrel-a-day increase the organization agreed to last month would be cut back by one-third. 
   OPEC is saying: If the price goes down below $22 a barrel, we will cut our production. We are nowhere near home on this by any means. We have been sold a bill of goods. Give the taxpayer a break. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I think the committee did speak clearly in the actual legislative language of the bill, which requires that the new investment authority be allocated ``consistent with the resolution of the Trustees adopted March 1, 1999 concerning the Restoration Reserve.'' Among other things, this resolution separates the remaining funds into two distinct ``pots'' of money: a $55 million pot which can be used for habitat acquisition; and a $115 million ``pot'' that will be used for research and monitoring activities. 
   As the Trustees have explained the resolution to me, the cost of administration for habitat acquisition will come from the $55 million and the cost of administration for the monitoring and research will come from the $115 million. Therefore, I am confident that the actual legislative language of the bill is clear and that this was the committee's intent. This provision was very important to me in drafting this bill because I have always been concerned about the tens-of-millions of dollars the Trustees have spent on administration of the funds. 
   We prepared a statement to clarify this matter last November. It should have appeared in the RECORD at the point where the bill was passed (S15162-S15163). Regrettably, the statement was mislaid and did not appear where it should have.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I am very pleased today to join with the majority leader, Senator LOTT, Senator CRAIG, Senator KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, and a number of Senators on a very important piece of legislation that is before this body, entitled ``The Federal Fuels Tax Holiday of the Year 2000.'' 
   This legislation is necessary because it will put a brake on the ever-rising gasoline prices that American families face every day. Unlike the airlines, the American family can't pass on the increased price in gasoline. Recently, the truckers came to Washington to express their concerns about the gas tax. 
   Energy and the cost of energy affects all of us in our lives in varying ways. So the idea of putting the brake on the 
   ever-increasing gasoline prices that American families pay each day is very important. 
   It is my hope that we invoke cloture tomorrow to ensure that the American motorist and workers get a break. 
   Our legislation provides a tax holiday for all Americans, from the gas tax, that Democrats, with Vice President GORE casting the deciding vote, adopted in 1993. That 30 percent gas tax hike was the centerpiece of one of the largest tax increases in American history and we believe with gas prices approaching $2 a gallon in some parts of the country, the American motorist should not have to continue paying the Gore tax. 
   I don't know if all my colleagues on the other side would agree with that nomenclature, but I think it is appropriate since the Vice President broke the tie which added a 30-percent gas hike. 
   In addition to temporarily ending the Clinton/Gore gas tax, our legislation guarantees that if the failed Clinton/Gore energy policies result in the price of gasoline rising over $2 a gallon, all fuel taxes will be lifted until the end of the year. 
   That means the American motorist will be relieved of the 18.4-cent-per-gallon gas tax. The trucking industry will not have to pay the 24.4-cent-per-gallon diesel tax. Barge operators will be relieved of the 4.4-cent-per-gallon inland waterway tax, and commercial and noncommercial aircraft operators will be relieved of the aviation tax. 
   It is certainly my hope that average gasoline prices do not rise above $2. But it is clear to me that $2 gasoline is well within the probability of becoming a reality because despite the administration's claims of victory about last week's OPEC meeting, Americans should not expect much, if any, of a price decline at the gas pump. Why? Let's look at it. 
   OPEC's decision to increase production by 1.7 million barrels per day is not, in my opinion, even a hollow victory for the Administration's, which lobbied for a minimum increase of 2.5 million barrels. The reality is that there isn't a real 1.7-million-barrel increase by OPEC. 
   Why do I say that? Let's look at the arithmetic. 
   OPEC agreed last year to 23 million barrels as their quota of production. They cheated by an additional 1.2 barrels, moving it up to 24.2. As a consequence, the difference between 1.2 and what they said we got as an increase of 1.7 is only 500,000 barrels of real increase. OPEC makes up 15.8 percent of American imports. As a result, we will be lucky to see another 78,000 barrels of oil in our market. 
   Will 78,000 barrels make a dent in gasoline prices? Not likely. Consider that motorists in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area use more than 121,000 barrels of oil in a single day. 
   With no relief in sight for the American motorist, we believe that the Gore fuel tax should be temporarily lifted. That would save American motorists about 4.4 barrels over the next 8 months. 
   If gasoline goes above $2, our bill suspends all fuel taxes resulting in a $19 billion saving to American motorists, truckers, barge operators, and airlines at the same time that fuel prices are near an all-time high. I believe the Government should suspend those taxes and ease the financial burden OPEC has placed on the American motorist and the industries that rely on fuel to move goods throughout this country. 
   I know some are concerned, if we suspend these taxes, that the highway trust fund, which finances roads, bridges, and mass transit, could be in danger. Again, I would like to put that fear to rest. 
   Our legislation ensures that the Highway Trust Fund will not lose a single penny during this tax holiday. We require that all monies that would have gone into the fund had the taxes not been suspended be replaced by other Federal revenue. That could come from the on-budget surplus, as I have indicated, or from what I would like to see, which is a reduction of wasteful Federal spending. 
   I can assure the American motorist that highway construction projects  this year and next year will be unaffected by the tax holiday that we are proposing. And when the trust fund is fully restored, all projects scheduled for beyond 2002 will be completed. 
   Some of the colleagues believe it is a mistake to establish a precedent wherein general revenues are used to finance highway construction. Ordinarily, I might agree with them, but not in this case. 
   All of my colleagues should remember that when the Clinton/Gore 4.3-cent gasoline tax was adopted in 1993, not a single penny of that tax was dedicated to highway or bridge construction. All the money was earmarked for Federal spending. 
   As I stated earlier, it was not until the Republicans adopted the 1997 highway bill that we shifted the 4.3-cent-per-gallon tax back to the highway trust fund. 
   Further, as I have indicated, Americans have paid $42 billion since the Gore tax went into effect. Of that $42 billion, $28 billion was spent not on highways but on general government and went into the general fund. 
   Let me repeat that. Of the $42 billion Americans paid under the GORE tax, $28 billion was spent not on highways but on general government. 
   I believe under these circumstances that it is perfectly reasonable for general revenues to be used to repay the trust fund money that should have been spent on highways. 
   The question before the Senate today is very simple. Do Senators want to give American motorists a break at the gas pump when gas prices are at near record highs? 
   I think it is important for everybody to understand that we are the elected representatives of the people. What is their choice? Do the people want to have relief from the gas tax? Is that their priority?

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. He further states: Existing leases and what oil and natural gas companies could do with them already are the objects of long-running legal disputes. 
   He says he would cancel leases in areas already leased by previous administrations. 
   These are existing leases; where is the sanctity of a contractual commitment? I believe if Florida and California don't want OCS activities off their coast, that is fine; that should prevail if that is what people want. In Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, and my State of Alaska, where we produce roughly 22 percent of the total crude oil produced in the United States, these States should go ahead because they want this. They recognize the alternative is not very pleasant--and that is to import more oil. 
   I leave Members with the very ambiguous reference this administration has given, suggesting things will get better. There is a certain psychology in reassuring citizens that the price will come down. However, in reality, the consumption is up, production is down, we are 56-percent dependent on imports, and the forecast is we will be 65 percent in the year 2015 or thereabouts. These are hardly reassuring notes, taken verbatim from this administration, to suggest things will get better. 
   In conclusion, from the CBS ``Early Show'' on March 29, 2000, from Secretary Richards, the Secretary was being questioned on his view of whether we could likely see some relief. He states as follows: This means for the American consumer, gasoline prices will gradually and steadily decline, according to the Energy Information Administration and my Department, by as much as 11 cents by the end of September or the end of summer. 
   That is quite a while. What do we do in the meantime? 
   Then he says: The bottom line is, I am just quoting our investigators and our official people who are saying 11 cents by the end of summer, possibly 15, 16 cents by the end of the year. 
   That is an indefinite forecast, in my opinion. 
   I appeal to the Chair to recognize that we can't believe the Secretary that the price is coming down. Every Member should support this legislation because it will keep the pressure on the administration to ensure it stays below $2 and this tax holiday won't be a reality. It will give the American consumer a safety net. Think about that. 
   The administration says: Don't worry, prices are on the decline. OK, if prices are on the decline--which I don't believe they are in the short term or the long term, but we will see who is right or wrong--we go ahead and pass the elimination of the 18.4-cent-gallon Federal tax, suspend it for the balance of the year, if the price goes to $2 a gallon for regular. That is a balance that puts the administration on notice to practice what they preach. If they preach the prices are coming down, this will never happen anyway. We are giving the American consumer a safety net. That safety net is real and it says if the price goes up to $2 the 18.4 comes off. I think that is a fair balance. 
   I will show this chart one more time. I find it outrageous. Who do we look to for imports? We look to Saddam Hussein and Iraq: Last year 300,000; now it is 700,000 barrels a day. 
   Where does the money go? It is going to Saddam Hussein. We fought a war over there--remember--in 1991. We lost the lives of 147 U.S. men and women. We fought a war to keep Saddam out of Kuwait. What did Saddam do when he lost the war? 
   Talk about environmental degradation. This is a picture of Kuwait with the oil fields on fire. We see the fires in the background. Here is an American with the firefighters helping put that fire out. That is the kind of guy we are dealing with to depend on imports. We had 23 soldiers taken prisoner over there. It has cost the American taxpayer $10 billion since the war in 1991 to keep Saddam Hussein fenced in enforcing the no-fly zones. 
   Within the last week, we did two bombing runs in Iraq because he was in violation of the no-fly zone, and we had antiaircraft action. 
   Isn't it incredible? We talk about foreign policy or energy policy of this administration, and we are feeding Saddam Hussein millions and millions of dollars so he can take that cash-flow and pay his Republican Guards who keep him alive. He doesn't funnel that into his economic system for the benefit of his people. He is in cahoots with the North Koreans, developing missile technology and our bombing airplanes are carrying his fuel. How inconsistent, how ironic. Talk about a full circle. We are importing 700,000 barrels a day, we are bombing him, we are using his oil that we refine to fill up our airplanes. 
   I may be reaching a little bit, but this is reality. We are importing 700,000 barrels a day. 
   It is my understanding this matter will come up tomorrow and we will  have a number of Senators active in the debate on the merits of the basic presentation. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I believe it was just a few years ago we had this stage of frustration. We were addressing the merits of these nonbinding sense-of-the-Senate resolutions. I put the matter to a vote. After much self-examination, why, the Senate decided not to support my amendment to do away with these nonbinding sense-of-the-Senate resolutions. But the debate was rather interesting because it addressed the right of a Senator to express himself or herself. Yet the realization that these should not be a part of the budget process, I think, was generally agreed upon by most Members. 
   I leave that for you to ponder because I think it represents a degree of frustration here.

Make no mistake, if the amendment of the Senator from Delaware is adopted, the Senate will go on record in support of a failed energy policy that rewards the price fixers in OPEC and the military ambitions of Saddam Hussein. 
   The Department of Commerce has indicated that our 56-percent reliance on foreign oil threatens the national security. One out of two barrels is imported. Our growing dependence on imported oil will mean 30 giant supertankers loaded with 500,000 barrels of crude oil will dock in this country every single day of the year. That is more than 10,000 ships a year. That is surely an environmental disaster waiting to happen. 
   America has the highest environmental standards and laws in the world. By increasing energy imports, we are simply exporting environmental problems to other countries. 
   Former Senator Mark Hatfield said, ``I would vote to open up that small sliver of ANWR any day, rather than send American boys overseas to risk their lives in a war over oil.'' 
   Mr. President, yesterday the issue of exports of Alaskan oil came up on the floor. I indicated at that time that when export contracts are completed this April, British Petroleum has assured me that it will cease exports of Alaska crude.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I note that the picture my friend from California identified--and that is an extraordinary picture of the Brooks Range, as she may not know--is nowhere near the Coastal Plain, the 1002 area about which we are talking. It is probably somewhere between 80 and 100 miles away. That is the wilderness we are committed to support and does not represent at all the Coastal Plain which is the issue before us.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is always amusing to me to learn the facts about my State, things I didn't know. I was 6 or 7 years old when my family moved to Alaska, and I have lived extensively throughout the State and believe I have some knowledge of facts and some knowledge of fiction. 
   I again refer to the picture my good friend from California portrayed. Those mountains are the Brooks Range. As this will show you clearly, the Brooks Range is an area we are committed to protect. As a matter of fact, it is the wilderness. The wilderness is not in jeopardy, in spite of what we have been led to believe by most of the speakers who have never been to Alaska in spite of the invitations extended over the years. 
   There are 19 million acres, as my friend from Oklahoma accurately pointed out. What we have done with this, the vision of Congress, was to establish both a wilderness and a refuge. The 
   wilderness is approximately 8 million acres. The refuge is 9.5 million acres, leaving this 1002 area, the Coastal Plain area, which has been referred to as the Serengeti of North America. 
   Let me tell you what is in it because no one has attempted to describe that. I find that extraordinary. It is treeless. It has no mountain. I think the hills are 1,100, 1,200 elevation. But those are found 20 to 30 miles from this coast. In this area, there are 92,000 acres of private native land. In the area of Kaktovik, Kaktovik is a native village. It has 223 residents and their attendant housing, their schools, their stores, their boats, their airstrips, their power lines, a variety of other modern-day facilities. The military's Barter Island DEW Line radar station is also nearby. It is hardly accurate to portray this unique area as the Serengeti of North America. It is unique, there is no question about it. 
   Now there have been many statements, and unfortunately there is just not enough time to respond to all of them. I think we should be sensitive to recognizing the reality that OPEC is watching this debate tonight. Saddam Hussein is watching this debate tonight. This debate addresses whether we are committed to reduce our dependence on imported oil or increase it. 
   The administration, when it made its profound announcement that they had been successful in convincing OPEC to increase its production by 1.7 million barrels, really left out a few interesting facts. It wasn't a net of 1.7 million barrels. It was actually a net of 500,000 barrels. We know that because OPEC had been committed to a production level of 23 million barrels a day in March 1999, but they had been cheating. They had been producing 24.2 million barrels a day. So the acknowledged difference between the announced 1.7 increase and the 1.2 cheating is only a 500,000 increase. To suggest that is all going to the United States is a fallacy. We get about 16 percent of it. As a matter of fact, the arithmetic suggests it is somewhere in the area of 121,000 barrels of oil, which is the amount, interestingly enough, that is consumed in the greater Washington metropolitan area every day. The percentage the United States would get out of that 500,000 barrels is somewhere in the area of 78,000 barrels per day. So we don't even stand still, if you consider our increasing demand. It is little or nothing in comparison to what our needs are. 
   Consider some of the facts associated with the lack of an energy policy in this administration. You can't help but be overcome by the reality that we have learned little from history. We were 37-percent dependent in 1973. 
   We are 56-percent dependent on foreign oil. The administration acknowledges that we are going to be about 64-percent dependent on foreign oil by the year 2015 to 2020. What does that mean to the coastline of California, New Jersey, or other areas where these tankers are going to come? The oil is going to come in, Mr. President. Well, it is estimated that that will mean about 30 giant--foreign, I might add--supertankers, each loaded with about 500,000 barrels of crude oil, will have to dock at U.S. ports every single day of the year. That is about 10,000 ships--as I have indicated, most are foreign flag--unloading in our harbors each year. I think this indeed creates a substantial environmental risk because you are not going to have many of these companies having the deep pockets of Exxon. 
   You speak of environmental issues. Isn't it better to promote development domestically when we know the global environment is going to be protected than to encourage development from Iraq or the Russian Arctic, where development is done without regard to the environment? Think about that, Mr. President. Think about the environmental community's attitude. They don't care where the oil comes from, as long as it doesn't come from up here in Alaska. If it comes from the Colombian rain forest, that is OK. If it comes from the dilapidated infrastructure of Russia, where there are leaks all over, no environmental enforcement, that is OK with them. It can come from Iraq, and that is OK. 
   I find that very ironic. We lost 147 American lives over in Iraq in 1991. We had nearly 300 wounded and 23 taken prisoner. The American taxpayers paid $10 billion to keep Saddam Hussein fenced in; that is enforcing the no-fly zone. We have military people stationed over there to ensure that he doesn't break out and invade Kuwait or threaten Israel. Yet our newest and fastest growing source of oil imports is Iraq. It was 300,000 barrels last year; it is 700,000 barrels this year. 
   I could go on and on, but clearly Saddam Hussein takes this revenue--and to suggest that he somehow uses it for the benefit of his people is obviously misleading. He uses it to keep the Republican Guard, which, in turn, keeps him in office--maybe keeps him alive, for all we know. Do you know what else he is doing, Mr. President? He is working with the North Koreans to build missile technology. What kind of a threat is that to Israel, or the United States, or the free world, for that matter? We are rebuilding Iraq's cash-flow, which sustains their economy. 
   I happen to believe charity begins at home when it comes to our energy security. We have the technology. We can do it right. Let's look a little bit at a map of Alaska. Before we do, I see I have a chart here that reflects Iraq's oil exports to the United States. The exports were virtually nothing in 1997, and now it is 700,000 barrels a day. What the administration did the other day regarding Iraq is, they had the Department of Commerce lift the export ban on technology, which will allow Saddam Hussein and Iraq to increase their production capacity. So the answer of this administration to address our energy needs is simply to import  more oil. Don't worry about any domestic development, we will get our oil from overseas. 
   There are a lot of politics in this issue, the issue of the 1002 Area of the Arctic Coastal Plain. The politics of America's extreme environmental community is evidence on this floor; it is evidence with the pictures and with the dialog and with the Members. I wish to God the environmental community would come to grips with reality and recognize the dependence we have on imports and what it is doing to our national energy security--come to grips with it and help us develop domestic energy sources with their recommendations, with attention to their environmental concerns, and help us to do it right. 
   So we attempted to do it right in Alaska. The Congress has attempted to do it right. We have 56 million acres of wilderness in my State. As I have said, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge 
   is an area the size of the State of South Carolina; it is 19 million acres. We have set aside, as I have indicated, 9 million acres in refuge, 8.5 million acres in a wilderness. But Congress, in its wisdom, left this area aside to determine its management status at a later time, with the belief that the national energy security of the country might necessitate its development. 
   Let's look at some factual pictures of what is going on in the real Alaska. Here is the real Alaska. Clearly, this is not in the 1002 area because there is no exploration activity allowed there. But I defy you, Mr. President, or any Member in this body, to look at this area and see any difference--you can see the ocean out here--but any difference with the general area of the Coastal Plain in the wintertime. This is a tough area, with winter 8 months of the year. 
   We have heard a lot about pipelines and a lot about gravel roads. This is the technology that is used in Alaska today. That is an ice road there. It is built up with ice and snow, and sometimes water is added. This is a drill pad. That is a factual picture of the technology used today. Let me show you what it looks like in the summertime on the tundra with that same well capped. That is it. That technology is utilized in Alaska today because it is the right thing to do. It is the environmentally compatible thing to do. You will not see that in any other oil field in the world. It is a long winter up there, Mr. President. 
   We have capabilities, obviously, to address some of the wildlife concerns we have heard so much about tonight. Well, you have seen this before. This is a picture in Prudhoe Bay, but you would never know the area from the Coastal Plain, with the exception of the pipelines in Prudhoe Bay. Here are three bears going for a walk, walking on the pipeline where it is warm. It sure beats walking on the snow. Nobody is shooting those bears; nobody is running them down. 
   We have a picture of some caribou. We have heard a lot about them from our experts who have never been to this area. This is in Prudhoe Bay. This is an oil field, and this is 35-year-old technology. These are some live caribou. I can assure you that those are not stuffed, like some of the conversation we have heard tonight. This is factual. 
   We have a herd of Caribou called the Porcupine herd and a legitimate concern about that herd because the Gwich'in people are dependent on it. It is kind of interesting to look at the history of this because as you look at Alaska, you also have to look at Canada because we abut. We have an interesting issue here. The Canadians, about 20 years ago, were very interested in drilling in the Mackenzie Delta, thought there was a great opportunity for oil and gas. So they drilled some 89 holes here in this area on the Mackenzie Delta, and they also built a highway called the Dempster Highway. The interesting thing is that this line on the map represents the path of the Porcupine caribou herd. Not only has it maintained its general stability during the time these areas were drilled extensively by the Canadians, but the caribou cross the highway. Now, it is not the beltway--I grant you that--but it is a highway that goes up into the Canadian Arctic. They wander into Alaska and go into the Yukon, where the Gwich'ins make a substantial take for subsistence purposes. 
   It is significant that these animals are adaptable; if you don't shoot them or run them down with a snowmachine, they can flourish. Now we have heard from the Senator from California, mentioning a letter from the Canadian Ambassador opposing development of the 1002 area. Yet they thought it was OK to drill their area. Maybe they are in a little competition between Canada and the United States for energy. We buy a lot of energy from them--a lot of electrical energy--particularly in the Northeast corridor. They are happy to do that; Alberta is happy to sell us gas. Maybe they don't want us to compete. I wonder if that could be the motivation of the Canadian Ambassador. 
   As we look at our concern over the Porcupine caribou herd, it is legitimate and the people associated in these areas are legitimately concerned. But we have been able to protect the caribou in Prudhoe Bay with 30-year-old technology. The herd has grown from 3,000 when development began to over 18,000 caribou. You can't take a gun in. You can't shoot them. 
   It is the technology that we have going for us now that offers us such a tremendous opportunity to develop this resource. If we were back before this body some 30 years earlier, we would have heard the debate on the appropriateness of opening up Prudhoe Bay. Prudhoe Bay was the largest oil discovery in North America, and it still is. There was a great deal of debate over how to develop it, and what the impact would be, because to get this oil out, we had to build an 800-mile pipeline across the length of Alaska. 
   We have a chart for those of you who wonder where that might be. It runs from the Arctic Ocean clear down through Fairbanks on to Valdez, where the oil is then shipped down to the west coast where it is primarily processed. 
   We had a terrible accident. The Senator from New Jersey was there. He knows that tanker ran aground in a 10 1/2 mile wide channel with absolutely no excuse. But the accident happened. But that wasn't the fault of the pipeline. That wasn't the fault of the oil field. It was a human error involving a supertanker, and it was inexcusable. 
   But the reality is we have been able to build this pipeline. It has withstood earthquakes. It has been shot at. It has been dynamited. It is one of the wonders of the world. 
   But 35 years ago or so, when we were arguing about this issue, we had the same arguments we have today. The doomsayers were saying: You are going to build a pipeline, a hot pipeline. It is going to take hot oil and pump it through a permafrost area; because that is what the Arctic is--permafrost, frozen ice and ground. That hot pipeline is going to melt the ground. You are going to lose the foundation. Your pipeline is going to break. 
   It didn't happen. 
   They said this 800-mile pipeline is going to be a fence across your State, an 800-mile fence. Your moose, your caribou, your animals are not going to be able to cross. It is going to be a calamity. It didn't happen. 
   There is nearly 1,000 miles of Arctic coastline. It is all unique and very much all similar. You look for oil. You find it where you are most likely to find it. The geologists simply tell us that the 1002 Area of the Coastal Plain is the area where we are most likely to make a major discovery; The USGS says 16 billion barrels. 
   Let me tell you something to factor in because we have heard so much rhetoric around here tonight. 
   For Prudhoe Bay, the recovery estimates were 9 billion to 10 billion barrels. Prudhoe Bay has been producing some 23 years. We have produced over 12 billion barrels, and we are still producing. It is estimated that we will probably produce for another decade, or maybe two, because the technology is such that we can get greater recovery. 
   When you talk about estimates, you had better be realistic. If there is no oil up here, nothing is going to happen, except you might have a lease sale. You might get a substantial payment from the oil companies that are prepared to bid on it. That is the risk they take. 
   We don't know what is up there. But the geologists say it is the most likely area for a major discovery. That is why Congress, in its wisdom, set this area aside for Congress to address and resolve at a later time. That is why we are here.  
   The Budget Committee took action because we have a crisis in this country. If you do not believe it, ask the Secretary of Energy. He went over to the OPEC countries. He said: We have an 
   emergency. You know what they said: We are having a meeting on March 27. He said: No. You don't understand, its an emergency. We sent 35,000 troops over here. We fought a war to keep Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. We lost American lives. We need help now. We need more oil production in those countries. You know what they told him: We are having a meeting on March 27. They stiffed him. 
   He went to Mexico. He told the Mexicans: We need more production. Mexico said: Fine. But where were you when oil was $11, $12, and $13 a barrel, and our economy was in the sack? 
   We have an emergency. If we don't take steps now to recognize our increased dependence on imported oil, one wonders when we will. What is going to happen to the security of this Nation from the standpoint of energy as we become more dependent on imports, more dependent on Iraq, and more dependent on OPEC? 
   Those are the realities we face today. 
   Let's take a look at something that is very unpleasant. I hate to show you this. But this is a terrible picture that ran all over America when Saddam Hussein was defeated and when he set the oil fields of Kuwait on fire. 
   You talk about environmental degradation. That is it. Here you see Americans over there trying to put out the fires and stop the environmental damage. You can see the burning wells behind him. This is reality. This is the kind of individual and the type of country and leadership on which we are now depending for our energy security. 
   I find it outrageous and inexcusable. I am very critical of the environmental community that condones oil coming from a tyrant, one who left an environmental scar of the magnitude that Saddam Hussein left in Kuwait. 
   Let's look at a couple of others because they are all bad. The only problem is that they get worse. How we can continue to be misled, if you will, through complacency associated with our dependence on Iraq is beyond me. Here we see the burning wells and the terrible mess that was left. Look at the Americans working in those conditions. 
   This Senator is not going to stand by and support increased dependency on Iraq when we clearly have an administration whose only policy is more imports. Give us more; give us more. It is like an addiction. It is pathetic. 
   You almost forget. And you can very easily forget that we are dependent on oil for transportation. Our truckers came to Washington, DC, and expressed themselves. They can't pass on the price. Look at your airline tickets. You pay a surcharge now. The consumer--the mom taking the kids down to the soccer game--is facing nearly $1.85 or $2 a gallon. It shoots a pretty big hole in a hundred dollar bill if she has a sports utility vehicle, and many of those aren't paid for. 
   But go a little further. Our farmers are getting geared up for planting season. What is the cost of that going to be relative to their productivity? Can they pass it on? 
   It multiplies. What do the farmers use? They use fertilizer. What is fertilizer made of--urea. It comes from gas and oil. The multiplier is there. 
   Look at our balance of payments. One-third of the $300 billion is the cost of imported oil. 
   Every time oil goes up $10, inflation goes up half of 1 percent. There are a lot of uneasy people out there. 
   This single issue today is going to send a signal about whether we are serious about alleviating our dependence on imported oil and are going to do something about it. 
   I have heard statements that it will take a while. Yes, it will take a while. President Clinton vetoed ANWR the last time it went down to the White House. That was in 1995. We would know today if we had oil there. We would be on our way to production. 
   One of the things that bothers me about the environmental community is they sell American technology and ingenuity short. We can do it better. We can make a smaller footprint, given the opportunity. And we have that opportunity before the Senate today. 
   We have heard conversations about oil exports. There has been oil exported because there has been excess capacity on the west coast up until a short time ago. Those who don't recognize and understand oil, unfortunately, don't know that oil used to move through the Panama pipeline, and prior to that in smaller ships through Panama, and to the gulf coast to be refined there. That changed when Venezuela came on production. So we had an excess on the west coast, a modest excess.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I certainly agree with my friend, the chairman of the Finance Committee, relative to the interest of America's environmental community. 
   This is a big issue for them because it generates membership and it generates dollars. They have a cause. We have heard from them, the eloquence expressed by my friend, the chairman of the Finance Committee. 
   But what we did not hear was any of the 500,000 American men and women who were sent to the Mideast to fight a war against Saddam Hussein. They left their loved ones. They risked their lives. What did America's environmental community say about that? They did not say a word. 
   What are they saying today about our increased dependence on Iraq? Seven hundred thousand barrels a day of oil; the fastest growing source of oil coming into this country. What is the environmental community saying? What we all believe in: More conservation, more alternative energies, as they drive in their automobile or pick up their plane to fly to the next point. 
   Come on, let's get real around here. We talk about ANWR potentially having a 200-day supply. Under that logic Prudhoe Bay should have been a 600-day supply. In reality, It has been supplying this Nation with 20 to 25 percent of our total crude oil for the last 23 years. That is a ridiculous comparison. It suggests that all other oil production is going to stop, all other domestic production is going to stop, and that is all you are going to have from one source. 
   Come on, get real. We can come up with better arguments than that. They say 95 percent of the Arctic Coastal Plain is open to oil and gas development. That is false. Try and get a lease up there. Only Fourteen percent is open. 
   This map shows the Naval Petroleum Reserve that was dedicated in the 1900s. You think you can get a lease in there? Try. Go over to the Secretary of Interior and see if you can get a lease. They put up a few leases, but you cannot go in and even lease where the high potential for oil is in the Naval Petroleum Reserve. If that isn't where you are supposed to find oil, I do not know where is. 
   Where are you going to find oil? The ANWR area isn't open. This other area of the State is partially open. But the reality is, the wilderness is closed. The Coastal Plain is closed. The Teshepuk Lake area is closed; Barrow is closed. The western portion of NPRA is closed to oil production. That is the reality. So do not buy their arguments that 95% of the Coastal Plain is available for development because it is ``pie in the sky.'' 
   We are concerned about our Gwich'in people. However, what they propose to do is lease their open lands for oil development. They offered to lease more than land than the entire 1.5 million acre Coastal Plain of ANWR. They offered to lease 1.799 million acres. They signed a lease. Unfortunately, the oil company did not find any oil there. Maybe they should have taken the leases anyway. 
   So we have more myth around here than fiction. No reality. No credit for American ingenuity or technology or the realization that this area we are talking about is the size of the State of South Carolina. 
   Mostly the Members here cannot comprehend size. We had four time zones in Alaska during the time I grew up--most of the time I was here. We cut them down to one. 
   If you overlay Alaska on the United States--you know it and I know it--we extend from Canada to New Mexico; Florida to California. The Aleutian Islands go out forever. They almost go to Japan. It is a big hunk of real estate. 
   We have heard a lot of romantic and fanciful notions tonight about the Coastal Plain. But we have not discussed and resolved the obligation to oversee the national security interests of this Nation. This is the Senate. We make decisions on war and peace. 
   ANWR is a serious issue. It is so serious that I hope you will all remember that if this amendment is adopted, I can assure every single Member of this body, we will well be on our way to jeopardizing our national security by further increasing our dependence on imported oil. 
   I do not want that obligation on my shoulders. It is time to turn around the direction in this country, reduce our dependence on imported oil, move into the areas where we have potential oil and gas discoveries in the Rocky Mountains, the overthrust belt, and my State of Alaska. 
   We have a Vice President who says he is going to cancel all OCS leases. Where are we going to get oil from? Where are we going to get the energy? Where are you going to get the fuel for that 747 called Air Force One to fly back and forth to New York or wherever it goes? Are you going to do it with hot air? 
   The Vice President goes around town. Does he drive a battery-operated car with the back seat full of batteries?  Does he drive an electric car? No. We are not there yet. 
   It is serious. This is an issue of national security. We fought a war over oil in 1991. We lost 147 lives. We have $10 billion of the taxpayers' money invested in keeping Saddam Hussein fenced in. 
   It is an issue of the environment. We have the best environmental stipulations in the world in the United States. Most of the OPEC countries have the worst. 
   They are drilling in the rain forests of Colombia. We have proven what we can do it right in the Arctic. We have a record. We have produced between 20 percent to 25 percent of our domestic crude oil in the United States in Alaska for the last 23 years. 
   It is an issue with the economy, sending our dollars overseas, our jobs overseas. It is a third of our trade imbalance. It is an issue that you--when I say ``you,'' I apologize to my colleagues--but no Member has addressed the people of my State, the Eskimo people who support development of this area. 
   You know what they say? They say, ``please put my people, the Inupiat Eskimo people, into the picture of ANWR. Stop airbrushing us out.'' Try being airbrushed out of the picture or out of your State. That is kind of the position to which these people feel they have been relegated. What a tragedy. 
   This is serious. This is not something that should be taken for granted. 
   The Eskimo people support development. One of my Eskimo friends, Oliver Levitt, to a group of us in Barrow, said: I used to come to school to keep warm. My job every morning was to go out on the beach and pick up what little driftwood floated down from the McKenzie River to the shores near Barrow. 
   He came to school to keep warm. That isn't the case in Barrow anymore because not only do they have the revenue from oil, but they have jobs. They have an alternate way of life that used to depend totally on subsistence and following the game herds. That is the record and the reality. 
   It was 20 below in Kaktovik yesterday, if it makes those of you in this body who have been listening to a little of my hot air cool off.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to advise my colleagues why I think it is appropriate that we address some relief for the American consumer with regard to the gasoline price spike that has occurred in this country. I am a cosponsor, with the majority leader, Senator LOTT, and a number of others, of this important legislation that will give us an opportunity to take positive action in a meaningful way to put a brake on the ever-rising gasoline prices that American families face each day. 
   The American people should have a choice, whether they feel the priority is such that they should have relief from the gasoline tax. I emphasize a choice. I emphasize the American people, through their elected representatives on this floor, have to make a determination that this is a priority because there is no free lunch around here. What we are talking about is a combined bill which would waive the Federal gasoline tax of 18.4 cents. That is a considerable tax. It is even larger when you add the State taxes to it. 
   When I said there is no free ride around here, what I meant was we have agreed if we suspend the Federal gas tax for the balance of this year, we will also make whole the highway trust fund. That alternative will require that we find considerable funds. But if we guarantee we are going to find them, that means they are going to come through the budget process, from surplus and other areas. 
   Is this a sufficient priority? There are those who feel very strongly this jeopardizes the highway trust fund. In this bill itself, it says we will hold the highway trust fund harmless. That is a mandate, in effect a promise, to hold it harmless. It does not say where the money is going to come from to offset it. 
   We are suspending it only for the balance of this year. I have been advised by the budgeteers that this will not jeopardize any of the contracts that are presently let for this construction year or next year that propose to use highway trust fund moneys because those have already, in effect, been designated, earmarked, and so forth. I am not on the Budget Committee, but that is the advice I have been given. 
   I think Members should understand a little background here. It was in 1993 that the Clinton administration proposed a significant tax on Btus. There was going to be a big tax increase on all Btus--British thermal units. It was going to be based on what you use. We debated this issue at length and we voted down the increased Btu tax that the Clinton administration proposed. However, there was a 4.3-cent-a-gallon gas tax that was also proposed at that time. It was hotly debated. That 4.3-cent-a-gallon gas tax was not designated for the highway trust fund. It was designated for the general fund. That is just where it went. 
   Of interest to the Chair, perhaps, is how this happened. All the Republicans voted against the tax; six Democrats joined us, and we had a tie vote. Vice President Al Gore sat in the Chair as the Presiding Officer of this body, where the Senator from Utah sits, and he broke the tie. The Vice President has to wear the mantle. That is where the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax came from. He has to wear the mantle. It did designate the tax would go into the general fund. Later, when the Republicans took control of this body, we changed the designation from the general fund and we designated that 4.3 cents into the highway trust fund. 
   It should again be noted what this legislation specifically provides because there is a lot of confusion over it. It says in order for the 18.4 cents to be suspended, and this is regular gasoline, the price has to average $2 a gallon. Only then will it be suspended, and only for the balance of this year. And the highway trust fund will be made whole. 
   I know there are Members who feel uncomfortable about the 
   highway trust fund. But all I can do is make very clear what this bill provides. It provides for full reimbursement of the highway trust fund. But it is not a free ride. The money is going to have to come from someplace else. 
   The point I want to make, and the appeal to my colleagues and our staffs who are listening, is about the real savings. America's consumers cannot pass on this price increase. If you buy an airline ticket, as my friend from Utah and I do occasionally, to go back to Utah or Alaska, you are paying a surcharge for fuel. You don't know what the tax is on the ticket because the airlines have so many confusing fares you can't figure it out, but a $40 surcharge is in there. 
   The trucker who comes to Washington, DC, who has a contract for delivery, maybe he cannot pass it on; and the farmer, it is very unlikely he is going to pass it on; nor the fishermen in my State who fuel up their vessels, it is pretty hard for them to pass it on--but the person who surely cannot pass it on is the American consumer, the moms driving their kids to the soccer game. 
   The family bought a utility sports vehicle for convenience. Maybe the SUV does not get too many miles to the gallon. It might have a 40-gallon gas tank. When mom goes to the gas station and fills that up at nearly $2 a gallon, it shoots a pretty good hole in a $100 bill. 
   The question before us is: Do we want to do something short term, or do nothing, which is what the administration proposes. My colleagues heard the President yesterday. He said we have to develop more dependence on alternative fuels, we have to develop more resources domestically. He does not tell you he is going to open up low-sulfur, high-Btu coal in Utah. No, he says he has made that wilderness, for all practical purposes. 
   He does not say he is going to encourage exploration on public lands in the Rocky Mountains so that oil and gas exploration can occur in those States in the overthrust area where there is a tremendous potential for oil and gas in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, North Dakota, Kansas, or Oklahoma, where the small strippers have almost gone out of production because they simply cannot produce at the low prices. They only produce a few barrels a day. My colleague, Senator KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, addressed that earlier today. 
   In our long-term package of proposals, there is relief for the stripper wells. There is relief to encourage exploration in the overthrust Rocky Mountain area. There is relief to provide OCS areas for lease--we heard the Vice President say: If I am elected President, I am going to cancel all the OCS lease programs. He does not say where he is going to get the oil to replace that produced under the leases. 
   Think about what this administration's policy is on energy. One does not have to think very long because there is none. Clearly, our Secretary was sent over to OPEC almost on his knees to beg for production increases. OPEC said they were going to have a meeting on the 27th. He was over there 3 weeks prior to that. The Secretary said: We have an emergency in the United States. They said: We are going to meet on the 27th. They met on the 27th. They did not do anything until the 28th. 
   I have a chart which shows what they really did. They did this yesterday. Not many people are aware of the realities associated with what has happened to oil and the demand for oil in this country. 
   To the left of the chart in the red is the total global demand for oil in the world today. It is about 76.3 million barrels per day. To the right of the chart is the production and where it comes from: 45 percent from non-OPEC, 23 percent from OPEC, 5.6 percent other OPEC. 
   My point is, actual production is 75.3 million per day, but the demand is 76.3 million per day. There is a 1 million-barrel-a-day difference. There is a greater demand than supply. When there is this kind of situation, we have price spirals. 
   I want to point out and make sure everybody understands what happened  yesterday with OPEC. I am really amazed, with the exception of the Wall Street Journal and a few other folks, the media has not really delved into this. When OPEC met last year, they decided they were going to produce 23 million barrels a day. They promptly began to cheat. They overproduced. They produced 24.2 million barrels a day. The difference between what they said they were producing, 23 million barrels a day, and what they were actually producing, 24.2 million barrels a day, is 1.2 million barrels a day. The difference between the 1.2 million barrels and 1.7 million is 500,000 barrels a day. That is what they are actually producing. 
   Here it is. They were cheating 1.2 million barrels a day. As I said before, they started out with 23 million but were actually producing 24.2. The difference between 1.2 and 1.7 is 500,000 barrels a day, and that is exactly what we got. That is the actual new production. It is not 1.7 million barrels a day, it is 500,000 
   barrels a day. 
   Let me take it one step further because this really excites me, and that is, what our share of OPEC oil has been. Our share has been about 16 percent. If we got another 500,000 barrels increase--remember, this does not go just to the United States, this goes to all the customers of OPEC all over the world. The U.S. share is about 16 percent. So that amounts to about 79,000 barrels a day. 
   With the help of some of my staff and the AAA, we determined the immediate metropolitan area of Washington, DC, uses 121,000 barrels a day. This means that with the 500,000 new barrels, we are not even standing still. 
   I do not want to put too much of an arithmetic load on my colleagues, but there is one more figure they ought to know about, and that is the little secret of the administration and the Department of Energy they did not want you to hear. They did not want you to find out what was written between the lines of the OPEC agreement. Here it is. Buried in the agreement is what they call a ``price band'' provision to keep the prices between $22 and $28 a barrel. We have seen prices for oil go up to $34. A year ago, that price per barrel was at $10 and $11. 
   This is a unique arrangement, but our friends in OPEC are unique in their craftsmanship of what is in their best interests. The arrangement calls for producers to increase output 500,000 barrels--remember where you heard it. That is the 500,000 that is the actual increase. They said:  
   The arrangement calls for producers to increase output 500,000 barrels per day on a pro rata basis if oil prices remain above $28 for 20 consecutive days.  
   My friend, I am a businessman. I understand the fine print of an agreement, but I do not think the folks down at the White House do or, if they do, they do not want you to know about it. This agreement further states that OPEC will also cut from production--there it is, cut from production, cut from their 1.7 million-barrel promise, or really the 500,000 barrels a day. They will cut from production by that same amount if prices fall below $22 for more than 20 days. They have set a ceiling, and they have set, obviously, a cellar. 
   OPEC or the Clinton administration has made no acknowledgment of this in their announcements. Isn't that rather curious? We talk about significant relief. If we have this kind of a deal, I do not know from where the significant relief is going to come. Under this agreement, one can easily see that the price of oil is going to hover around $28, maybe as high as $34 per barrel for extended periods or until OPEC meets again. 
   I urge those in the media and my colleagues, and particularly their staffs who are a little bit curious, to read today's Oil Daily, page 2. It is all spelled out under the headline ``OPEC Bases New Production Strategy on Price Band Experiment.''

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, now they are experimenting on us with this price band. That is a pretty dangerous precedent to set, but, nevertheless, we have become so beholden to OPEC, we are 56-percent dependent on OPEC. 
   The occupant of the chair remembers the Arab oil embargo in 1973. We had gas lines around the block. A lot of people were unhappy. Oil was more than $30 a barrel. We were excited here. We were concerned. We said: We will never allow exports to get to a level of more than 50 percent. We created something to ensure that we had some relief. We created the SPR, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We wanted to have a 100-day supply. I think we have a 56-day supply in the SPR today. 
   Now some people say: We have an emergency. Take the supply out of the SPR. Think about that. It is very dangerous to use your reserve to manipulate prices. You can only draw about 4 million barrels a day out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is located in the salt mines of Louisiana. If you take it out, remember, you have to refine it. Then what are you going to do for a fallback in a real emergency? 
   OPEC is watching what we do. If we pull down our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, we become that much more vulnerable and, as a consequence, more likely to be held hostage. 
   As we address what we are going to do this afternoon, again, I reiterate, is the priority here for a short-term fix for the American consumer not at the expense of the highway trust fund but at the expense of making it up through the budget process some other way? I think that is a legitimate question. 
   When you pit what we are attempting to propose on this side of the aisle, which is some kind of relief, to that proposed by the other side of the aisle, which is no immediate relief, the difference is clear. The Administration suggests only that we develop alternatives, and that we have conservation, all of which are worthwhile. But those goals are not going to help mom today on her way home with the kids from the soccer game when she has to fill up the sports utility vehicle and it is going to cost her $80. It is not going to help the farmer. It is not going to help my fishermen. It is not going to help the truckers. They want relief today to stay in business. 
   We have that opportunity. We are going to make that choice. It is a choice. It is a legitimate choice. It is a matter of determining where the priorities of this body are. 
   We have a lot of options. We have some specific proposals for the short term and the long term that I think deserve consideration. Because if you look at the other side and the administration proposals, it is pretty hard to find anything this specific. 
   The American people are saying: Hey, we have a crisis. We have a problem. The difficulty I have, to a large extent, is where we are seeking relief. We are not only limited to petitioning OPEC. 
   Let's take a look at our friend, Saddam Hussein, in Iraq. I have a chart that I think shows and tells more than I can say in a few words. This shows the Iraqi oil exports to the United States. There is virtually nothing in 1997. 
   But we all remember in 1991 we fought a war over there. We sent young American men and women. We had 147 casualties in that war--147. We had 423 who were wounded. We had 26 who were taken prisoner. 
   That war was in 1991. But what about the American taxpayer? What happened? You remember, we have been enforcing the no-fly zone over there. We have troops stationed around there. We have the fleet. We have been keeping Saddam Hussein fenced in, if you will. The cost to the American taxpayer has been $10 billion. That is what it has cost in the last 9 years. The administration does not factor that in. 
   When we look at our fastest growing source of imported oil coming into the United States, it is coming from our good friend, Saddam Hussein. Incredible. I am indignant over it. I don't know about you and my colleagues. 
   Last year, we imported 300,000 barrels a day from Iraq. This 
   year we have imported 700,000 barrels a day. 
   The day before yesterday the Department of Commerce issued a release on sanctions for some of the technical parts that are needed within Iraqi refineries to increase their production by an additional 600,000 barrels a day. We are certainly cooperating with Saddam Hussein. Where do the profits go? We suspect they probably go to the Republican Guard who have something to do with keeping Saddam Hussein safe. It is questionable if funds really go to the people of Iraq. 
   I was looking at some figures the other day. As we rely on the Mideast, I think we should be reminded that what is happening here is we are enriching the Mideast, the Arab oil empire. 
   As I said, in 1973 we were 36-percent dependent. Today we are 56-percent dependent. But the startling reality is--and you may not believe history teaches anything; some people say it does not teach much--but the forecast that the Department of Energy has publicly put out is that we will be importing 65 percent of our oil by the year 2015 to 2020. 
   Currently, we receive 46-percent of our oil from OPEC; that is, on the 11 OPEC nations. Are these countries that we can depend on? How stable are they? What is the risk to Israel as a consequence of the difficulties and distrust in that part of the world?

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise as an original co-sponsor of S.J. Res. 14, a resolution proposing that the Constitution be amended to permit Congress to enact statutes to protect against the physical desecration of the American flag. Although it is rare that I support amending our Constitution, in this instance the Supreme Court has made clear that a federal statute is incapable of protecting the national symbol of America. 
   There is no doubt in my mind that every single Member of the Senate abhors the idea that someone would desecrate the American flag. Yet the vote  on this amendment will be far from unanimous. That is because many of my colleagues believe that adoption of this amendment somehow represents an attack on the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech. In my view, this amendment in no way threatens the freedoms embodied in the First Amendment. 
   The freedom of speech that is guaranteed in the first amendment of the Constitution is not unlimited. The Supreme Court has long recognized that the law must strike a balance between society's and government's interest and the interests of the individual. More often than not, the Court has come down on the side of the individual. However, the Court has recognized that society's interest in public safety outweighs an individual's right to freely shout ``Fire'' in a crowded theater. The Court has balanced society's interest in national security with a speaker's interest in disclosure of state secrets and has upheld restrictions on such speech. 
   By this amendment, we are not challenging the first amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech. Anyone in America is guaranteed the right to criticize nearly every aspect of American society and American government. Nothing in this amendment precludes such speech. 
   Instead, this amendment speaks to the issue of desecrating the symbol of this country. A symbol that is recognizable throughout the world as the symbol of this 224 year old democracy. A democracy that has asked its men and women to fight all over the world to preserve democracy and freedom against tyranny. 
   When in 1989 the Supreme Court by a 5-4 decision struck down a Texas Flag desecration statute, Justice Stevens dissented and eloquently stated why the Court had reached the wrong conclusion about the First Amendment in this case. Let me quote Justice Stevens:  
   The Court is ..... quite wrong in blandly asserting that respondent ``was prosecuted for his expression of dissatisfaction with the policies of this country, expression situated at the core our First Amendment values.'' Respondent was prosecuted because of the method he chose to express his dissatisfaction [burning an American Flag] with those policies. Had he chosen to spray-paint--or perhaps convey with a motion picture projector--his message of dissatisfaction on the facade of the Lincoln Memorial, there would be no question about the power of the Government to prohibit his means of expression. The prohibition would be supported by the legitimate interest in preserving the quality of an important national asset. Though the asset at stake in this case is intangible, given its unique value, the same interest supports a prohibition on the desecration of the American flag.  
   Would anyone disagree with Justice Stevens' suggestion that the first amendment does not permit an individual to desecrate the Lincoln Memorial by spray painting his political views on the Memorial? Surely that would be a criminal act and no one would suggest that the spray painter's first amendment rights had somehow been invaded. 
   Yet, I ask the question: What is the difference between barring someone from desecrating the LINCOLN Memorial and barring someone from desecrating the American flag? Why are the marble and mortar of the Memorial more important than the intangible values represented by the American Flag? Does it make a difference that the American taxpayer paid for the construction and upkeep of the Memorial and therefore as public property an act of desecration is actionable? 
   I do not think that the payment of taxes to construct and maintain the Memorial should make a difference. Are we to compare the payment of taxes to construct a Memorial with the sacrifice of the hundreds of thousands of men and women who fought in wars over two centuries to preserve the democratic ideals embodied in our Constitution? I think not. 
   As I said earlier, I am not a frequent supporter of amending the Constitution. I would prefer that we adopted a statute to prevent flag desecration. But those who argue for a statute ignore the fact that 11 years ago Congress adopted a statute--the Flag Protection Act--which outlawed desecration of the flag. That Act was adopted in response to the Supreme Court's decision striking down the Texas statute and along with that state law, the state flag protection laws of 47 other states. Unfortunately, one year later, the Supreme Court struck down the Flag Protection Act, again by a 5-4 vote. 
   So the only realistic way that we can outlaw flag desecration is by adopting a Constitutional Amendment. Let the people of the 50 states decide whether our flag deserves such protection. I urge my colleagues to support S.J Res. 14.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, there has been a great deal of anticipation today on what OPEC might do. For those of you who do not recall the sequence, several weeks ago, our Secretary of Energy went over to OPEC, encouraging them to increase production. The concern was that we were approximately 56-percent dependent on imported oil. A good portion of that came from OPEC. As we saw with the Northeast Corridor crisis on heating oils, there was concern over the availability of adequate supplies of crude oil. It appears that we are using somewhere in the area of 2 million barrels a day more in the world than are being produced currently. That sent a shock through the oil marketeers and resulted in our Secretary going over to OPEC and meeting with the Saudis and urging them to increase production. 
   They indicated they were going to have a meeting on March 27, which is today, and would respond to us at that time. The Secretary indicated that this was a dire emergency, that oil prices were increasing and the East Corridor was looking at oil prices in the area of nearly one and a half dollars and he needed relief now. The OPEC nations--particularly the Saudis--indicated they would address it at the March 27 meeting. So, in other words, the Secretary was somewhat stiff-armed. 
   Well, the Secretary, as you know, went to Mexico and encouraged the Mexicans to increase production. The Mexicans listened patiently, but they reminded the Secretary that last year when oil was $10, $11, $12, $13 a barrel, and the Mexican economy was in the bucket, where was the United States? The Secretary indicated we would help Mexico out with the tesobonos, ensuring that they would be bailed out. But to make a long story short, we didn't get any relief from Mexico. 
   Well, today, we didn't get any relief from OPEC. OPEC said they would address it tomorrow. So the question of whether or not we are going to get relief, I think, points to one thing: We have become addicted to imported oil. We are like somebody on the street who has to have a fix. The fix is more imported oil. And when the supply is disrupted, we look at what it takes to get more. 
   Well, it takes maybe a higher payment, a shortage of supply. It makes the price go up. That is the position we are in. I encourage my colleagues to look very closely at what OPEC does tomorrow--indeed, if they do anything--because what they have been doing so far is cheating. Who have they been cheating on? They have been cheating, in effect, on themselves at our expense because last year they agreed to cut production. They developed a discipline within OPEC to cut production back to 23 million barrels per day. But they did not keep that commitment. They are currently producing 24.2 million barrels a day. That is about 1.2 million over the agreement. 
   So if they come up tomorrow and announce they are going to come out with a million and a half barrels a day increase, that isn't a million and a half barrels net; the net is 300,000 barrels a day. So we better darn well look at that arithmetic. If they come up with 2 million barrels a day, that is relief, in a sense, but in the last year our demand increase has been a million and a half barrels a day in addition, and I did not take into account my arithmetic. Remember, we are not the only ones in the world who consume oil from OPEC. Those other countries are going to have to share in 
   whatever increased production comes out. 
   So it is indeed a rather interesting dilemma that we find ourselves in as we now are dependent 56 percent on imported oil. The Department of Energy tells us that in the years from 2015 and 2020, we will be 65-percent dependent on imported oil. Well, some people say you learn by history. Others say you do not learn very much. Obviously, we have not learned very much. 
   There is one other factor I think the American people ought to understand. Where has our current increase been coming from? It has been coming from Iraq. Last year, we imported 300,000 barrels a day from Iraq. Today, we are importing 700,000 barrels a day from Iraq. Today, the Department of Commerce lifted some sanctions off of Iraq to allow the Iraqis to import from the United States certain parts so they could increase--these are refinery parts--refining capacity by 600,000 barrels a day in addition. 
   So here we are, importing 700,000 barrels a day currently from Iraq. Some people forgot we fought a war over there not so many years ago--in 1991. What happened in that war? We lost 147 American lives; 423 were wounded in action, and we had 26 taken prisoner. In addition, the American taxpayer took it. Where did he take it? He took it in the shorts because since the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991, just to contain Saddam Hussein and keep him within his boundaries, the cost of enforcing the no-fly zone and other things is costing the American taxpayer $10 billion. 
   So here we are today looking at OPEC for relief, allowing them to get parts for their refineries so they can increase production. Here we are depending and begging and passing the tin cup for OPEC production. The answer lies in decreasing our imports on foreign oil and, as a consequence, producing more oil and gas in the United States. We can do it safely. We have the American technology. We have the overthrust belt, the Rocky Mountains, Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Montana, Louisiana, Texas, those States that want OCS activity. 
   My State of Alaska is perfectly capable of producing more oil. We produce nearly 20 percent of the total crude oil; it used to be 25. We have the technology. We know how to open up the Arctic areas and make sure the animals and the character of the land are protected because we only operate in the wintertime. Our roads are ice roads. They melt in the spring. There is no footprint. If there is no oil there, there is no footprint of any kind. We can do that in these areas. But as a consequence, we have to look for a solution. 
   I hope my colleagues really pick up on this. If OPEC does increase production, there are going to be those who claim victory, that we got relief. But it is going to be a hollow victory because that victory simply says our Nation becomes more dependent on imported oil. I think most Americans are waking up to the reality that that is a very dangerous policy. To suggest we got caught by surprise--I will conclude with two little notes. In 1994, Secretary of Commerce Brown requested that the independent petroleum producers do an evaluation on the national energy security of this country and came to the conclusion that we were too dependent on imported oil. 
   Last March, Members of the Senate wrote a bipartisan letter to the Secretary of Commerce, Secretary Daley, asking for an evaluation on the national security interests of our country relative to our increased dependence on imported oil. He released that report in November. It sat on the President's desk until Friday. They finally released it in a brief overview. The conclusion was that we have become too  dependent on imported sources of oil and it affects the national security of this country. What do they propose to do about it? They don't have an answer. 
   I will talk more on this tomorrow when we have further information on OPEC.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I will take the opportunity, as the junior Senator from Alaska, to make a few comments relative to the designation by Alaskans of Senator TED STEVENS, Alaskan of the Century. For years we have been proclaiming the Alaskan of the Year. This is an extraordinary designation to honor an extraordinary individual. 
   When I first came to the Senate in 1980, as a freshman with virtually no experience in the legislative process, I had an opportunity to have an extended discussion with Senator STEVENS. He suggested the best position for the State of Alaska would be for him to give up his position, his longstanding seniority on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, so I could serve on that committee, and he vacated that spot. He could be not only the chairman of the Appropriations Committee but senior member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and could be chairman if he so chose. But he chose to leave that committee and make an opening available to me. Now I have the honor of serving in that capacity. But it was a sacrifice for him. It was a sacrifice he made on the basis of what was good for Alaska that he pursued the appropriations process, the Governmental Affairs Committee on which he served and continues to serve, as well as the Commerce Committee. 
   I might add, with his seniority he has the option of serving as chairman of those committees, as well as of the Rules Committee, I believe. So he is really in an extraordinary position of seniority within this body. As a consequence of that, the contribution he has made, it is quite fitting Alaskans have selected him the State's Man of the Century. I do not believe there is a more deserving individual in our State. That is evidenced by the support Senator STEVENS has received in this nomination. 
   I am going back to Alaska tomorrow, along with our House colleague, Representative DON YOUNG, to acclaim, if you will, the recognition of Senator STEVENS and his wife Catherine in receiving this award. 
   He has been a central figure in our young State's history. It has been a time of unparalleled changes in the 49th State. The remarkable thing is that TED, while he has become a figure of national prominence, has not lost his interest and relationship with Alaskans. When we became a State in 1959, we had a lot of catching up to do. Senator STEVENS has been very active in ensuring that Alaska catch up. The rest of the States have been around 100, 150 years, some of them 200 years, but ours has not. 
   While TED currently ranks sixth in the Senate in overall seniority, second among Republicans--and is just one of 109 Senators who have served in this body for more than 24 years--he still can be found meeting every Alaskan Close-Up student group, talking with residents about health concerns and meeting villagers about their rural sanitation needs. 
   In his 36-year legislative career--four years in the Alaska House of Representatives and now in his 32nd year in the U.S. Senate, TED has played the largest single role in seeing Alaska, a territory of just 210,000 people 41 years ago, grow into a vibrant, modern state that has more than tripled in population. 
   In the state's House he crafted legislation to help the state recover from the devastating 1964 Good Friday earthquake. As majority leader in the state's House and Speaker pro tempore, he helped Fairbanks residents recover from the massive flooding they faced in 1967. And in 1989-90 he and I worked together to help craft federal legislation to help Alaska recover from the aftereffects of the 1989 wreck of the Exxon Valdez oil tanker in Prince William Sound. 
   His encyclopedic knowledge of Federal-Alaska State relations is legendary in Washington. In the Senate, which has lost much of its institutional memory in the past decade, TED is able to offer insights on everything from passage of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Act in 1974, to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971. He can talk about passage of the Magnuson Fisheries Conservation Act of 1978--a law now justly named after him--to passage of the Alaska Lands Act in 1980. Those four laws are the keys to shaping the direction of Alaska as we enter the 21st century. His recollection of events is so 
    extraordinary not only because he helped draft the Alaska Statehood Act, while serving as a legislative counsel at the Department of the Interior starting in 1956, but because he served as chief counsel and solicitor for the Interior Department in Alaska in 1960--helping to get the young State off and running after Statehood in 1959. 
   I won't take this Chamber's time to talk about the Senator's early life, or even his impressive military career, where he served as a Flying Tiger in the U.S. Air Force in China during World War II--service that helped form his comprehensive knowledge of the military, which has been such a help to him in shaping our Nation's Armed Forces budgets over the past two decades from his post on the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   I do want to speak a bit about what it has been like working with Senator STEVENS. While we have disagreed on only a handful of issues over the past  20 years, TED STEVENS has truly given of his time and shared his great knowledge and expertise to help me to represent the citizens of our State. He has selflessly given guidance and counsel to help our delegation reach a common accord on what is best for Alaskans. And I can't personally thank him enough for his many kindness. We have truly worked together to help our small State, one that sports just three electoral votes, have a voice in the direction of our Nation. It has not always been easy. 
   We have had to battle those who have no knowledge of what life is truly like in Alaska, whether we are trying to save our timber industry in Southeast Alaska, or trying to protect our rights to access our natural resources--Alaska's main means of supporting our citizens and our State government. We are working together to win the right to produce oil, without environmental damage, from North America's last great storehouse of energy--the Arctic coastal plain. 
   While TED served eight years as assistant Republican leader (whip) handling key national issues, especially defense matters, he has been willing to put aside personal ambition for the good of his State. Many forget that TED sacrificed his seniority on the Commerce Committee to move to the Energy and Natural Resources Committee during the key fight over the Alaska lands act. He then moved back to Commerce to represent Alaska fishermen--proof positive that TED always puts Alaska first. During his years on the Appropriations Committee, he has battled hard to make sure Alaska receives its fair share of Federal funding--money needed to help Alaska provide basic services to its citizens--piped water and sanitary sewers, roads and schools that Americans elsewhere take for granted. 
   Today I, join with all Alaskans, to thank him for his skill, drive, and dedication and congratulate him on the honor he will justly receive this weekend. I also offer him a heart-felt wish for many, many more years of service to the State and the Nation. Nancy joins me in congratulations to both TED and Catherine on this honor. It's been a great privilege working with you my friend.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to address an issue that is very close to Alaska, Senator STEVENS, our Representative YOUNG, and myself. It represents the myth associated with ANWR and the realization that Alaska has been producing almost 25 percent of the total crude oil that has been produced in this Nation for the last 23 years or thereabouts. 
   I have here a map of Alaska that shows the pipeline and gives you a dimension of the magnitude of this particular area of our State. It is necessary that you recognize, as we address the disposition of allowing exploration in ANWR, that this was established as a responsibility that only Congress could address in releasing this particular area for exploration. 
   I am going to give you an opportunity to view a map of Alaska. Alaska is a pretty big piece of real estate. On a map, if you overlayed Alaska on the United States, it would extend from Canada to Mexico and from Florida to California. We have the Aleutian Islands that go out almost 2,000 miles. The breadth of the State from the pipeline alone at Prudhoe Bay to where the pipeline ends at Valdez is 800 miles. It is a big piece of real estate. 
   Until a few years ago, we had four time zones in the State alone. When Senator STEVENS or I go back to the State, we just begin our travel. We have a very small segment of the State that has a road system. This entire western area is without any roads, with the exception of a few miles in Nome and Kotzebue, and the villages. 
   We are not connected to the continental United States, as you can see. Our neighbor to the right, Canada, constitutes a barrier--a foreign country; a good friend--from the rest of the United States. We have our southeastern part where our State capital is in Juneau, roughly 700 miles from our largest city, Anchorage. Our second largest city, Fairbanks, is 400 miles to the north of Anchorage. 
   I go into this detail because it is important, as we look at the issue of ANWR, to keep it in perspective. I am going to refer to the chart behind me because I think it represents an appropriate comparison. 
   Let me advise my colleagues of a couple facts. 
   One, ANWR is going to be in the budget. We are going to be addressing the budget in the coming weeks. It is going to be in there at an anticipated revenue forecast of about $1.5 billion to the Federal Treasury. You can evaluate the pros and cons of that. It is also going to be in the Republican package that we are preparing to try to do something meaningful about the energy crisis in this country, which the current administration has not done.  They have no energy policy, as evidenced by their inability to address what they are going to do with hydro. 
   Some want to tear the dams down. What are they going to do with the electric industry? Obviously, Carol Browner wants to close half a dozen coal-fired plants, with no indication where we are going to pick up the alternative. Our nuclear situation is such that we cannot address what we are going to do with our nuclear waste, yet the nuclear industry contributes 20 percent of our energy in this country. 
   If you look at gas, you may assume, as some do, that all we have to do is plug into it. If you read the National Petroleum Council report on gas, you have to recognize a harsh reality: We are using about 20 trillion cubic feet of gas a day. In another 10 to 15 years, we will be using 31 trillion cubic feet a day. We do not have the infrastructure to deliver the anticipated demand. It just isn't there. It is going to require over $1 trillion--the industry figures $1.5 trillion--in the next decade, and that is 
   only if we have access to areas where we are likely to find gas. 
   Much of the overthrust belt--which is the Rocky Mountains--65 percent of that has been removed from exploration. So where do we go? We go offshore; we go to Louisiana; we go to Texas; we go, to some extent, to Colorado and Wyoming, but we do not have an aggressive plan. 
   But we have an opportunity, in my State of Alaska--a significant opportunity--and that is ANWR. 
   What is the significance of ANWR? ANWR is shown on this map in this little tight corner, over here by the Canadian border. It looks small on this map, but it is in proportion. 
   There are those who say: Good heavens, you are going to jeopardize this area for exploration. 
   What we, as Alaskans, have not been able to portray--because the media will not pick up on it, and people are evidently not interested enough to recognize the proportion here--this is ANWR. This is 19 million acres, as shown by this little spot up here. It is as big as the State of South Carolina, a pretty big hunk of real estate. What have we done with this? 
   In 1980, we made some permanent designations. We created the refuge, the arctic refuge: 9.5 million acres in perpetuity. We went up and created a wilderness: 8 million acres in this area that is shown on the map marked with the slices. 
   But we left for Congress's dictate 1.5 million acres, so-called 1002 areas, up here. The reason we left it is, Congress was concerned there might be major deposits of hydrocarbons in this area, just like there were in Prudhoe Bay. 
   Let's look at Prudhoe Bay for a moment because there is an interesting parallel here. Prudhoe Bay is where the oil development is today. Let's look at Prudhoe Bay today and let's look at the traditional oil development and a picture that is an actual scene showing Prudhoe Bay and the animal activity that surrounds the area. 
   I show you a picture taken some years ago, but it represents the heart of Prudhoe Bay. There you see the pipeline. You see the oil derricks, and you see the caribou. 
   There is a degree of compatibility there. The reason it is there, obviously, is nobody is shooting these animals; nobody is running them down. There are no snow machines. It is summertime. There is no threat. They feel very much at home. 
   These are nomadic herds that move in and out, but there is a compatibility. We have seen a tremendous growth in this western arctic herd since we developed this area. The reason we have seen that is there are no guns allowed in the area. These animals are protected. They prosper, as they should. To suggest somehow they are in jeopardy defies reality. 
   When we started oil drilling in Prudhoe Bay, there were 3,000 or 4,000 caribou in this herd. There are over 18,000 today. That is just a fact associated with experience that we have already had. Prudhoe Bay's technology is 30 years old. We can do a better job if we are allowed in here. 
   What is the footprint going to be if we indeed are allowed to open up ANWR? The footprint is estimated by the industry to be 2,000 acres out of all of ANWR's 19 million acres. That is what we are looking at. We are keeping the refuge, we are keeping the wilderness, and we are making a determination. 
   What does it look like when they are drilling in the area? This is what we would like to communicate to the American people. It is a pretty tough environment. There it is. We have a well under construction. This is not in ANWR because there is no entry or activity allowed. It is a typical scene in the Arctic in Prudhoe Bay. This is an ice road. They don't allow anything on the tundra in the summertime, but the ice roads stay there about 9 months of the year because you are way above the Arctic Circle, nearly 400 miles. It is a harsh environment. 
   That is a typical rig. When the disposition of this is made one way or the other, what is going to be left? Well, let's look at it in the summertime. Same site, summertime activity is gone; ice road is gone. There you have it, Mr. President: the tundra, a spigot; that's it. 
   I always think of my good friend, Senator Mark Hatfield. Mark Hatfield, it is safe to say, was a pacifist. He said: I will vote for ANWR any day of the year rather than send our troops in danger in the Mideast to keep oil flowing from neighbors we cannot count on. 
   All right. Where are we? This is an extraordinary chart. This marks from where our increasing oil exports are coming. Ironically, they are coming from Iraq. Last year, we imported 300,000 barrels a day from Iraq. This year we are importing 700,000 barrels a day. How many people remember 1990 and 1991? Do you know what happened over there? We fought a war. We fought a war to keep Saddam Hussein from invading Kuwait. What did that cost us? That cost us 147 American lives. We had 448 wounded. We had 23 taken prisoner. That is a cost. 
   We had another cost. What has it cost the taxpayers of this country since that war was over? What has it cost us in the last 10 years, from 1991 until today, to keep Saddam Hussein fenced in, enforcing the no-fly zone, enforcing, if you will, the embargoes, putting the fleet over there? We added it up. It is $10 billion. That is what it has cost the American taxpayer: 147 lives, 448 wounded, 23 prisoners, $10 billion. 
   Where are we getting our oil now? The fastest increasing imports are from our old buddy, Saddam Hussein. Isn't that ironic? 
   Look at the national security interests of this country. We are today 56-percent dependent on imports. When we fought this war, we were 47- to 49-percent dependent. I think the President will recall, in 1973, we had an energy crisis in the country. We called it the Arab oil embargo. We had gasoline lines around the block in this Nation. People were inconvenienced. So Congress acted. At that time we were 37-percent dependent on imported oil. Congress set up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and said we would never approach 50 percent. We are going to take action. We never got 100 days supply of oil in SPR. We got a 56-day supply. That is what it is now. 
   Now there are proposals we should take oil out of SPR for the national crisis that we have on oil prices. That is very dangerous because if you take it out of SPR, you still need more imported into the country. And your good neighbors, the Saudis and the Mexicans, know it; the Venezuelans, you have less leverage. If we are ever going to take anything out of SPR, we should have a certification from the Secretary of Defense that it does not jeopardize our national security because you can only pull about 4 
   million barrels a day out of SPR. 
   The point is--and it is a very important one--go very slow with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve because after that, you don't have a backup. So here we are, depending on Saddam Hussein today. I find it inexcusable. This administration has no energy policy. They hope this won't be an issue in the campaign. They hope the issue will go away, and they hope the Secretary of Energy is going to be successful in his efforts to go around with that tin cup and try and get more production. 
   Let's see what he has done so far. He went over to Saudi Arabia about 10 days ago and said: We have an emergency in this country. They said: Well, we will have a meeting on March 27. We will address greater oil production then. He said: No, you don't understand; we have an emergency now. We fought a war over here. We kept Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. They said:  I'm sorry. We are going to have a meeting on March 27, and we will address it then. 
   He got stiffed by the Saudis. So he went to Mexico and said: We need more production. The Mexicans said: Well, we appreciate that. We would like to help you, but you have been buying oil at $11, $12, $13 a barrel. Our economy went in the bucket. Where were you? The Secretary said: Well, we bailed you out of the tesobonos. We had a tremendous refinancing commitment for Mexico. They said: Sorry. We got stiffed. 
   So where did the Secretary go next? Well, he went over to some of the other countries. Nigeria, you might get a little out of Nigeria. I don't know. 
   Here is the superpower of the world, a Nation that is the most productive and has become the most dependent on imported oil. Make no mistake about it, we have to conserve. We have to have alternative energy. We have to develop the technology, but we have to be realistic. If somebody drove here, somebody came in on an airplane, they are going back the same way. We don't have the technology now for hydrogen. Fuel cells won't do it. Four percent of our energy is alternative. I wish it were more. Some of you came in here in a sports vehicle. Gasoline, at $1.70 a gallon, is going to shoot a pretty good hole in a $100 bill when you fill up that 40-gallon tank. What are we doing about it? We are hoping the problem will go away. 
   It is not going to go away. It is going to get worse. We are going to be held hostage again and again. So our alternative is greater production in the U.S. Keep the jobs at home, keep the dollars at home, and for heaven's sake, why can't we do it? We have the technology; we have the know-how. 
   We have a very active, extreme environmental community that is opposed to any resource development on public land, whether it be grazing, whether it be timber--timber, of course, is renewable--whether it be mining, whether it be oil and gas. 
   This administration doesn't have a policy. They want to tear down the dams. They won't do anything about nuclear. Nuclear is 20 percent of our energy in this country. They don't have a policy. 
   We are trying to do something about it. I am chairman of the Republican Energy Task Force. We have a legislative package, short-term, interim, and long-term. We are proposing to do away with the gasoline tax and not jeopardize the highway trust fund. It can be done. If gasoline gets up to $2 a gallon, or thereabouts, I am of the opinion that we ought to do away with all of the tax. That is a little over 18 cents a gallon. 
   We have a positive approach. We are going to stimulate development and on public land and on offshore areas. We are going to stimulate development of our agricultural potential in ethanol. My good friend, Senator GRASSLEY, has been a proponent of that for some time. We need all the domestic sources of energy we can get--the sooner the better--to get off this kick of paying tribute to Saddam Hussein. 
   Do not be misled. We have an opportunity to open up an area. We can do it safely. We have the technology. 
   I am going to counter some of the myths that are associated with ANWR. 
   Some ask: What do you want to open this area for because all of this Arctic coast is available? It is not available. That is truly a myth. With the exception of the area between the Colville and the Ganning Rivers, which is owned by the State of Alaska--this little area in here--more than 1,000 miles of the Arctic coastline is closed. That is just the harsh fact. 
   What you have over here is a rather interesting piece of real estate because it happens to be an old naval petroleum reserve, now called the Petroleum Reserve Alaska. 
   For heaven's sake, if you can't initiate exploration of a petroleum reserve that was designated in the 1900s or thereabouts, where can you? What an irony. There have been a few leases here. There is some production in there. But where the independents wanted to lease, the Department of Interior wouldn't put up the area for lease. As a consequence, that is an unrealistic statement. It is not factual because this is the Coastal Plain that borders clear around to here, and a very small portion is open. That happens to be State land. The Federal lands are not open. The Department of Interior won't issue a permit. They won't put up a proposed bid. That is just the fact. 
   Let's move a little further. 
   The State of Alaska will get 90 percent of the royalties. 
   That is not true. The royalties are split 50-50, just like they are in Oklahoma or Louisiana or any other State. 
   Somebody said Alaska's indigenous people are against all oil exploration in the Coastal Plain. That is very inaccurate. There are Inupiaq people in one Eskimo village called Katiovik that sits right here. 
   I have another chart that shows you a greater portion of where this little village is. It is the only community within ANWR. They strongly support onshore exploration for oil and gas. That is in their backyard. 
   Let me give you another example. We have a group called the Gwich'in near the Canadian border who are opposed to opening ANWR.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this lease is from the native village of Venetie. It has the signatures of Sarah James and a number of others. It is dated April 2, 1984, and it specifically states that the acreage offered under the lease is 1,799,927.65 acres, U.S. Survey 5220. 
   That is where we are relative to the issue of some of the folks who feel that this is not in their interest, but by a long shot that is not all the people. 
   I point this out not to condemn the attitude of my constituents but just to point out a reality that at one time they were willing to sell their interest in leasing this land for oil and gas, and now, to a large degree, their public relations efforts are funded by the Sierra Club and others. 
   I will submit at a later time the specific financial contributions that are paid to the Gwich'in by the various environmental organizations. 
   What is happening in Alaska is a molding of our State into the image that much of America's environmental community would like to see established as opposed to the reality associated with the population of our State, some 700,000, and the fact that we are the new kids on the block. We have been a State for 41 years. We don't own our own land. 
   Here is the land ownership in Alaska, unlike Illinois or California or any other State. We have 368 million acres in our State. 
   What is it made up of? Let's look at private land ownership in our State: 5 million acres; less than 2 percent. Why is that? Because the Federal Government owns it. OK? We have 51 million acres of national parkland; 76 million acres of Fish and Wildlife land; 23 million acres of U.S. Forest Service; and 57 million acres of wilderness forever locked up. 
   How much is enough? Where is the balance? 
   This is the Bureau of Land Management alone controls 65 million acres. The State has 104 million acres in State land. The State is so lucky. It must have had a fortune teller. This little piece of land right here is what funds our State, the land it had when it became a State. 
   The Natives finally gave land to residents of Alaska. The Natives got 43 million acres. But the Federal Government owns our State. That is just the reality. 
   Some say we need to save ANWR for our grandchildren. We need to know if oil is there. If there isn't, it is not going to be developed. You have to find a lot of oil in Alaska before drilling. Otherwise you can't afford to drill it. If they cannot produce 5,000 barrels a day, the cost is not economical. 
   Prudhoe Bay came in. It is 30-year-old technology. It is a pretty big footprint. We went from there to Endicott. Endicott is up in this area. 
   The significance is that when it came on it was the tenth largest producing field in the United States. It came in at a little over 100,000 barrels a day. Today, it is the seventh largest producing field. The footprint is 56 acres because it is all directional drilling from one spot. It makes sense in Alaska, but the costs are high. We could do a better job if we had an opportunity over here. 
   As a consequence of whether we need this oil now or later, we had better find out whether it is there or not. They can only do that through exploration. Then they can make a decision. 
   As a consequence of this, we run into one other argument, which really bewilders me because it is so unrealistic. They say, well, the Coastal Plain may only have a 200-day supply of oil, and that is not worth developing. 
   Let me tell you a little bit about it. First of all, Prudhoe Bay was supposed to have 9 billion barrels of oil. It has been producing now for 23 years. We have had a total of 12 billion barrels from Prudhoe Bay in the last 23 years. We were supposed to get 10 billion barrels. It is still producing at a million barrels a day. It is good for another 10 years with the technology that we have. 
   When you say this only has a 200, do you know what you are implying? An unrealistic argument because you are saying the rest of our domestic oil production would stop. That is totally unrealistic. A two-hundred-day supply, but that is assuming the rest of the oil is produced domestically in this country is going to stop. First of all, it is not going to stop; is it? That is an argument so full of holes that it defies imagination. 
   Let me show you what happens when we bring oil on line from Alaska and what it does to our imports because I think it states in no uncertain terms the reality associated with the opportunity we have now. 
   Let's recognize what has happened here. This body passed ANWR 5 years ago, in 1995. 
   The President vetoed it. Had he not vetoed it, today we would have had a lease sale and we would know what the prospects for a major discovery were. We might be within a very short time of production. 
   Somebody says opening ANWR will not have any impact. Wrong. Here is the proof. This chart identifies our imports in 1975, 1976, 1977, and 1978. They were going up dramatically, 6 or 7 million barrels a day. We developed Prudhoe Bay in 1976, the current field we have. We can see when it came online and production increased, imports dropped dramatically, it was a major contribution. It was 2 million barrels a day, 25 percent of our total domestic production. 
   To open up Prudhoe Bay, it took this Senate meeting in this Chamber with a tied vote. Vice President Spiro Agnew broke the tie. That is why we have Prudhoe Bay today. That is why we have production of 20 to 25 percent of our crude oil. That is reality. 
   Don't be misled by the myths. We are not going to destroy the Coastal Plain. We are not going to destroy the caribou. We are only going to allow activity in the wintertime when the caribou come through and calve. As the picture demonstrates, caribou are healthy for the most part. Do not suggest we cannot address our concern over the migratory Porcupine caribou herd; we can do it if given the opportunity. 
   Somebody says ANWR oil will be exported and not reduce our dependency. I have received a letter from BP that says they are curtailing their small amount of exported oil.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. That situation may be resolved by the takeover by Phillips of ARCO. BP did not have on the west coast any refineries. ARCO did. 
   To make a long story short, with BP acquiring ARCO refineries, there will not be a surplus on the west coast. I think the amount varied. There were up to 60,000 barrels a day at one time. I have been assured as a consequence of the change, the purchase by Phillips of ARCO, that the little oil that was exported will be terminated simply because it will be utilized by BP in their refinery.  
   Some say any development in Alaska would be environmentally damaging. People might not like oil fields, but Prudhoe Bay is the best oil field in the world. We can do a better job if we can get into ANWR; there is no question about it. 
   They say the Coastal Plain is unspoiled. Let me say something about the Coastal Plain. It is not unspoiled. In one sense, there is an Eskimo village there. Those people live there. There are a couple of radar sites that are, and for all practical purposes have been abandoned. This section of the State is pretty remote. One cannot find anything much more remote than this particular area of our State. It is probably one of the better areas if one were looking for less of an impact on mankind and animal-kind. 
   Some ask what will happen to the birds. Most of the birds are near the lakes. Birds come in, they migrate. The issue isn't that there are no birds in ANWR, because there are. 
   Some ask about the polar bears. They den on the ice; they do not come ashore. A few do. Do you know what we have done to save the polar bear? We don't allow the white man to shoot the polar bear in our State. You can't shoot them. That is the greatest threat they have. The native people can keep them for subsistence. A white man can go to Canada or Russia and take a polar bear. So that is a bogus argument. We are protecting the polar bear. To suggest a little exploration is going to threaten the polar bear is a specious argument. 
   This is what the press and the public do not digest. I guess we have a hard time communicating that reality. 
   Here is another picture of our friends taking a walk. Three bears are walking on top of the pipeline. Why are they walking on the pipeline? Because it is easier than walking in the snow. They don't get their feet cold or damp. It is just easier. 
   The predictions that were associated with developing Prudhoe Bay have not come true. They said: You are putting a fence across Alaska; the caribou and the moose will never cross it. When you put a hotline in permafrost, it will sink to China. 
   These things never happened. That pipeline is one of the construction wonders of the world. It has been bombed, shot at, dynamited, not to mention having withstood earthquakes. We had a bad accident with a ship called the Exxon Valdez. It was the fault of the crew. We had a 10-and-a-half-wide channel, and they ran on to a rock because they were drinking coffee and not paying attention. That is a harsh reality of that. Then they took on a little alcohol and everything was lost. 
   The public ought to understand reality. I would love to debate some of the extreme environmentalists because they don't know what they are talking about, but they won't give me the courtesy or the chance. They refuse to let me participate in any of their gatherings. We have a letter that gives an idea of the extent to which some of the environmentalists go to generate public opinion. They are entitled to that, but by the same token, we are entitled to communicate some of the tactics. 
   In a letter from the Sierra Club, Friday, January 2000, called ``The New Millennium Action Special Edition,'' it says: 
   This February 5th, the Sierra Club, together with the Alaska Wilderness League, the Wilderness Society, the National Audubon Society, is hosting another National Arctic Wilderness Week in Washington. Supporters from grass roots are key in protecting the 
   Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and its fragile Coastal Plain. This gathering will help arm you with the skills and knowledge you need to build support in your community. 
   They give hands-on training. They will provide you with opportunities for training. You will learn how to intensify your skills in lobbying, message development, meetings, communications and legislative advocacy. All are worthwhile and appropriate. 
   It says further: We've got you covered. 
   That is the last paragraph: ``We know your time is valuable so we don't ask you to cover all your expenses for the trip.'' 
   A trip from where? A trip from Alaska, that's where. It is expensive, about a $1,000 to get here from Alaska. It also says that you need to pay a $40 registration fee, but if you don't have it, some scholarships are available. Where does that money come from? The Wilderness Society and the Sierra Club of course:  
   We'll pay for your travel to Washington, DC, your hotel, two in a room, a continental breakfast each morning and several dinners. Unfortunately, space is limited so hurry up. To find out if you are eligible phone the Sierra Club.  
   I don't know any development groups that have that kind of money to do that kind of lobbying. Nevertheless, that is reality. It is fair game. Just make sure the public knows about it. Many of these people have never been to ANWR. That is what bothers me. I have been there. I take a group of Senators up there every year so they can see for themselves and make their own evaluation as they represent their State. 
   One of the things I will conclude with: If you are from the Northeast corridor and you are sick and tired of high prices for heating oil, you haven't seen anything yet. 
   The Northeast corridor is just getting started. And here is why. 
   This is the harsh reality of where we are today. Our crude production is represented by this gray line. It is roughly 6 million barrels a day domestically, this is down from 7.5 million. So our crude production is dropping. It is dropping significantly. The crude oil production is dropping and the petroleum demand is going up. What is happening here is the crude oil production has dropped about 17 percent, and the petroleum demand, which is the black line, has gone up 14 percent. So we have a shortfall. So we have to make up the difference. 
   We have had the heating oil crisis in the Northeast corridor. There was an assumption we would have a cold winter. We didn't. There was an assumption we would have storage. A funny thing is, 20 percent of the crude oil storage in the Northeast corridor has been eliminated because it did not meet legitimate environmental concerns, as well as 15 percent of the heating oil storage. These are old tanks that didn't meet specs and were not rebuilt. 
   We have lost 37 refineries in this country in the last decade. Why? The refinery business is not too attractive for a lot of reasons. You have Superfund exposures, you have EPA requirements, you have a situation where the return on investment is questionable. Many of the majors have gone out of the refining business because of the consequences associated with that. 
   So you have a situation now where the Northeast corridor better look out for their high electric bills. This winter it was high heating oil bills, but it is going to be electric bills this summer. Only 3 percent of the Nation's electricity comes from oil-fired generating plants, but that is not true in the Northeast corridor. It is nearly one-third. New England relies on fuel oil for about a third of its power generation. Just a small handful of those plants will be setting the electric prices in the region during the periods of high demand. This is going to cost Northeast residents millions of dollars. So what do they want us to do about it? Do they want us to import more oil, or do they want us to relieve our dependence by producing safely and domestically? 
   The arguments I get from all of the Northeast groups: You can't open ANWR. You cannot do it safely. They are breathing the fire of the radical environmental movement that wants three things: They want a cause, they want dollars, and they want membership. They sell America short--especially America's ingenuity and our technical ability. The fact is, we can produce energy here at home. They will not debate me. They refuse, they absolutely refuse. 
   So this is what is going to happen in the Northeast corridor. I hope the newspapers and their editorial writers start figuring this out because it is going to happen. Remember when you heard it first. 
   Electricity establishes a rate structure from a uniform price. Under that method, the central dispatchers first tap generation offering to sell electricity at the lowest price. But as the demand goes up, air-conditioning use goes up, and you are going to see the more costly generating powerplants come on line. Those are the ones that are oil fired.  
   The power purchasers pay all bidders the price charged by the last powerplant called into service. In many cases, the final unit will be an old, oil-fired plant which will charge a rate higher because of the higher oil prices. All other non-oil-burning plants will reap a windfall profit because they will be paid as if burning oil. That is the way the process works. I hope somebody can take heed of what I am telling you. New England relies on 30 percent fuel oil for its own power generators. 
   What do they want us to do? They say: Alternative energy. Fine. Let's do it. What are we going to do? Four percent is what we produce currently. 
   Let's spend more on development. We are. We do not have the hydrogen technology yet. 
   In the meantime, we have an opportunity for domestic relief, 
   and I implore those people up there to seize that opportunity. It is as if they are born with their eyes closed, and they keep them closed to the reality that we can open these areas safely. They say: The Senator from Alaska comes to the floor and his motivation is selfish. 
   Sure, I represent my State. Sure, this is in my State. But my State doesn't consume it. Sure, we get half the revenue, just like Oklahoma or any other area. But this is domestic energy for domestic jobs paying domestic taxes and providing for the national energy security of this Nation. 
   Some of these other folks would rather have us import it from Saddam Hussein. That is where it is coming from, 700,000 barrels a day, from a country where we lost 147 servicemen fighting a war. 
   So we are going to be facing higher prices. Non-oil-burning plants are going to reap a huge windfall. New England is going to take it and they are going to scream and ask why we are not doing something about it. It has been estimated an oil plant that offered electricity at $37 a megawatt hour for power 1 year ago is probably going to be seeking a price of $75 or more because they are going to have to buy oil on the open market. Remember, oil has gone from $10 to over $30. That is significant. 
   There are a couple of other factors a lot of people overlook. There is an inflation factor. They figure every time oil goes up $10, it contributes about 1/2 percent to inflation. We have seen the truckers come to Washington. They came twice. Do you know why they were here? Because they cannot pass on the increased price of diesel fuel. They are stuck. They are going out of business. 
   Wait until you see the farmers when they start fueling up to plant their crops. They are going to be screaming. They will be driving their tractors to Washington. They will want relief. The relief of this administration is to go beg for more oil production in the Mideast. I find it inexcusable. 
   We concern ourselves with the deficit in the balance of payments, $300 billion a year. That means we are buying more from countries than they are buying from us. But of the $300 billion, $100 billion is the cost of imported oil. We are sending our jobs overseas. We have seen employment in the domestic oil industry drop dramatically. 
   It is important that Members understand what has happened to this country and to our ability to maintain a growing industry that we have become so dependent on, and what a poor job we have done on it. What we have done, under this administration, is to simply import more oil, propose more taxes. I think the administration's tax proposal is about $2.5 billion this year. 
   We have seen the gas tax, 4.3 cents a gallon. I would like to do a little short review because I remember 1993. I remember when the Republicans lost control of this body and the Democrats took control and the administration came in with a huge Btu tax--British thermal unit--a tax on energy. We defeated that tax then. It is a good thing we did. But we also had a 4.3 cent-per-gallon gas tax and that was not going to go into the highway trust fund. That was proposed to go into the general fund. 
   We had a vote. Every Republican voted against it. We had six Democrats join us. 
   The vote was tied. Vice President AL GORE broke the tie, and that is why we have the 30-percent increase in the gas tax that went on in 1993 at 4.3 cents a gallon. Our Vice President, who broke that tie, deserves accolades, if you will, because he bears that responsibility. We are living with it today, and it has cost the taxpayers somewhere in the area of $43 million. 
   That gives us some idea of the background of how we got to where we are and what kind of a policy this administration has toward our energy crisis. They hope it will go away. There is so much finger pointing around here that one cannot believe it. 
   The Secretary of Energy the other day said an interesting thing. He said: We were caught by surprise; we were caught napping. 
   Come on. Let's recognize facts, and facts are that in 1994 the independent petroleum producers were concerned about our dependence on imports. They solicited Secretary Brown under the Trade Expansion Act and asked him to do an evaluation of the national security risk, and he did. As a consequence of that, even the President acknowledged our energy dependence on the Mideast and our oil imports affect the national security interests of the Nation. 
   He did that. What happened? Nothing. There was no relief. So we went along even more. In any event, nothing was done. Time went on. We became more dependent. As a consequence, we found ourselves in a situation last March where many of us became concerned. We became so concerned that we wrote a bipartisan letter to the Secretary of Commerce, Secretary Daley. 
   I have the letter dated March 21 to our President. I am going to quote what he said in November after he received the report from the Department of Commerce by Secretary Daley. He said:  
   I'm today concurring with the Department of Commerce's finding that the Nation's growing reliance on the imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products threaten the Nation's security because they increase U.S. vulnerability to oil supply interruption.  
   He was on notice in 1994. 
   To bring my colleagues up to date, in March of last year a bipartisan letter went to Secretary Daley asking him to again initiate, under the Trade Expansion Act, an evaluation of the danger to our national security because of our increased dependence on imports. That was done. It was delivered to the White House in November of last year, and the White House either did not open their mail, sat on it, or put it at the bottom of the stack. In any event, they have refused to release that report. 
   Clearly, it is going to say the same thing. The national security of our Nation is at risk because of our increased dependence on imported oil. I am told we are looking at billions of dollars of increased appropriations this year for the military so they can have fuel for our defense. We have another case of this administration refusing to recognize reality. It is as though they want to get out of town before this becomes a political issue or before the American people understand the danger of what is happening because of our increased dependence on imported oil. 
   The chairman of the Armed Services Committee, JOHN WARNER, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, JESSE HELMS, our majority leader, TRENT LOTT, and I as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, all wrote a letter to the President asking him why he has not opened that report he received in November from the Secretary of Commerce. We asked why he has not shared that with the American people, and to tell us whether our national security is at risk because of our increased dependence, again on our old buddy, Saddam Hussein. How ironic. What goes around comes around. 
   Last year, we had 300,000 barrels a day from Saddam Hussein; this year, 700,000 barrels a day. The fastest growing source of our imports is coming from Iraq. I will say it again and again and 
   again. In 1991, we lost 147 lives, 448 soldiers were wounded, 23 were taken prisoner, and the U.S. taxpayers paid $10 billion to fence in Saddam Hussein. 
   Where does this oil go? It goes to the United States--to you and me, and for our airplanes and cars. Where does the money go? Do you think it goes to the people of Iraq? It goes to Saddam Hussein who controls the flow of that money. Do you know where most of it goes? It goes to the Republican Guard that guards him and keeps him alive. He has probably had more assassination attempts than we know. But he takes good care of those people. How does he do it? He has one source of  cash-flow--oil. I just cannot accept the policies of this administration to enrich that man. 
   We have the farmers, and we have the truckers. Mr. President, have you flown lately? Have you looked at your airplane tickets? They put on a surcharge. Nobody can figure out what the ticket costs anyway. If it is a short trip, it is $20. If it is a long trip, it is $40. 
   Have you received a FedEx package lately? There is a surcharge added. 
   Pretty soon, the American people are going to wake up. A surcharge is going to be on everything. They say: Oil really hasn't affected inflation. Don't be too sure it has not hit yet. 
   Do my colleagues think we will get relief? We will see what happens on Monday. Anything that happens on Monday is 8 weeks getting to your gas station. That is the harsh reality. 
   The policy of this administration is more imports. That is it. They never learn by history: 37-percent dependent in 1973; 47-percent dependent when we fought the war in the Persian Gulf; 56-percent dependent now; 65-percent, according to the Department of Energy, in the year 2015 to 2020. Does it behoove us to take action now? I think so. 
   I told you a little bit about exploration and production. Here is what happened in our employment in energy: 405,000 employed is down to 293,000. That is the position we are in. 
   Our oil production domestically dropped from about 7 billion to about 6 billion in this period of time because we don't have an aggressive posture. It is not that we do not have oil and gas. This administration will declare victory, I guess, on the 27th if OPEC releases more oil. But I think Americans are going to have to ask a basic question, a simpler question, and that is: Will the administration's actions decrease our oil dependence or increase it? That is the basic question, and the American people ought to understand it. 
   Next Monday is March 27, and they say there will be an increase in foreign production of another 1 million to 2 million barrels. Then the administration--the Secretary of Energy and the President--is going to claim victory. They will say: We have more oil. 
   How hollow, because it is going to increase our dependence, it is going to give them more leverage. We are going to have another crisis. They said OPEC could never get together and did not have the discipline. They did. They got together. They would rather sell their oil at a higher price than sell less oil, obviously. They would like to see it somewhere at $20 to $25 to keep us on the hook. That is the thought. 
   I encourage the American people to ask: Is this in our national interest to swallow the administration's claim of victory? If indeed there is a significant increase coming, if we swallow the administration's claim of victory that it is in the Nation's interest to become more dependent on imported oil, or strike out with an aggressive posture based on American technology and American can-do spirit to develop resources at home in the overthrust belt in my State of Alaska? 
   I implore my colleagues who want to speak on behalf of America's environmental community, to know what they are talking about. I ask them to get up to ANWR and Prudhoe Bay and take a look at it. See what we have done and look at some other oil fields. Just do not take the word of the self-anointed environmental groups that have a mission. That mission is membership, dollars, and a cause. 
   I am not suggesting they do not make a significant contribution. The problem is that they refuse to recognize that we are going to be needing crude oil--petroleum products--for a long time. They refuse to recognize that we are better off developing domestically than importing it. They refuse to recognize where we are getting our imports, the significant role of our rock. They refuse to recognize the role of the lives we lost in the Persian Gulf war. They refuse to recognize we have done a pretty good job in developing oil and gas resources. We can do a better job, if given the opportunity. 
   I do appreciate the time that has been allotted to me today. 
   I think it is important to recognize that, in all honesty, we do not have an oil policy, we do not have an energy policy. I fear my colleagues from the Northeast are going to be exposed to substantial increases in electricity. 
   I have the obligation to proceed with electric reliability bills, electric restructuring. But the fact is, they are going to be dependent on fuel oil making electricity. The price is going to be a lot higher than they have ever had before. People are going to be asking, What are you doing about it to relieve the problem? I hope their answer is not solely to increase imports. 
   I again extend my willingness to travel to the Northeast corridor, my willingness to meet with the editorial writers of the Northeast papers that continually misrepresent facts. I encourage them to give us an opportunity to be heard. I encourage them to come on up and take a look and spend the money so they can objectively make recommendations and decisions upon those to whom they and their papers and their media extend themselves. 
   I would like them to know that our Governor, and our delegation would love to have you. We will treat you with a level of hospitality that you will find quite suitable and quite comfortable. You might want to bring some long underwear though. 
   Give us an opportunity to contribute to this country. 
   The last thing I want to say is, we became a State in 1959. That was 41 years ago, or thereabouts. The rest of the country established their land patterns 100, 150 years ago. We are still trying to develop an economy. We have 700,000 people. We are trying to develop a university. We don't have any roads across our State. The Federal Government owns it. We are dependent on natural resources. Our fish are renewable. Our timber is renewable. We also have a lot of oil and gas.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I alert my colleagues that an extraordinary thing happened yesterday in the House of Representatives. The House accepted the Senate bill on nuclear waste without amending the Senate bill. 
   As the occupant of the Chair knows, oftentimes the House has a little difference of opinion on what is good for the country. The bill we passed in the Senate on nuclear waste had certainly a vigorous debate in this body. There were 64 votes recorded for the legislation which would resolve what to do with our high-level nuclear waste and how to proceed with the dilemma associated with the reality that the Federal Government had entered into a contract in 1998 to take this waste from the electric-power-generating units that were dependent on nuclear energy. This is the high-level rods that have partially reduced their energy capacity and have to be stored. We have had this continued buildup of high-level waste adjacent to our reactors. 
   The significance of this is that this industry contributes about 20 percent of our power generation in this country. There are those who don't favor nuclear energy and, as a consequence, would like to see the nuclear industry come to an end. But they accept no responsibility for where the power is going to be made up. Clearly, if you lose a significant portion, you will have to make it up someplace else. 
   The point of this was to try to come to grips with a couple of things. One is that the ratepayers have paid the Federal Government $15 billion over an extended period of time to take the waste in 1998. The second issue is the cost to the taxpayers because since the Federal Government has failed to meet the terms of the contract and honor the sanctity of the contract agreement, there are damages and litigation from the power companies to the Federal Government. That cost is estimated to be somewhere in the area of $40 to $80 billion to the taxpayer in legal fees associated with these claims that only the court will finally adjudicate. 
   By passing the Senate bill in the House--I believe the vote was 275--indeed, it moved the issue closer to a resolve. Many in this body would like to not address it. That is irresponsible, both from the standpoint of the taxpayer and from the standpoint of the sanctity of a contractual commitment. If we don't do it, somebody else is going to have to do it on a later watch. 
   The difficulty is, nobody wants the nuclear waste. But if you throw it up in the air, it is going to come down somewhere. 
   France reprocesses theirs. The French learned something in 1973, during the Arab oil embargo. They learned that they would never be held hostage by the Mideast oil barons and be subservient to whatever the dictates of those oil nations were and what it cost the French economy in 1973. As a consequence, they proceeded towards the development of a nuclear power capability second to none. About 92 percent France's power is generated by nuclear energy. They have addressed the issue of the waste by reprocessing it through recycling, recovering the plutonium, putting it back in the reactors, and recovering the residue. The residue, after you take the high-level plutonium out, has a very short life. It is called vitrification. 
   In any event, we are stuck still. We can't resolve what to do with our waste. But we have a bill that has moved out of the House. It is our bill. I have every belief it will go down to the White House. We will have to see if the President wants to reconsider his veto threat in view of the energy crisis we have in this country now and the fact that the administration does not have an energy policy, let alone the willingness to address its responsibility under the contractual terms to accept the waste. If the administration chooses to veto it, we have the opportunity for a veto override. In this body, we are two votes short. 
   I encourage my colleagues, particularly over this weekend as they go home, to recognize that this issue is going to be revisited 
   in this body. If they have nuclear reactors in their State and they don't support a veto override, they are going to have to wear the badge, the identification of being with those who want to keep the waste in their State. That is where it will stay. It will stay in temporary storage near the reactors that are overcrowded and that were not designed for long-term storage. It will never get out of their State unless we come together and move this legislation, if the President does not sign it now that it has gone through the House and Senate. 
   Unfortunately, this would put the waste ultimately in Nevada where we have had 50 years of nuclear testing out in the desert, an area that has already been pretty heavily polluted. We have spent over $7 billion in Nevada at Yucca Mountain where we are building a permanent repository. Quite naturally, the Nevadans, my colleagues, will throw themselves down on the railroad track to keep this from happening. 
   But the point is, you have to put it somewhere. In my State of Alaska, we don't currently have any reactors. 
   As chairman of the Energy Committee, my responsibility is to try to address this national problem, with a resolve. What we have, obviously, is this legislation that has passed both the House and the Senate. It will be back. It will be revisited. I encourage my colleagues to recognize that we have a responsibility to address this on our watch. If we put it off, somebody else is going to have to address it. It is going to cost the taxpayer more. Now is the time, since we finally have a bill that has gone through the House and Senate. 
   The interesting thing is, had the House taken up our bill and amended it, we would be hopelessly lost because there would be a filibuster on appointment of conferees. It would take 9 days or something like that. It could not be done. 
   That didn't happen in the House. I commend the Speaker, Denny Hastert, for keeping a commitment. I commend our leader, Senator LOTT, who made a commitment that we were going to bring this up. Not only did we bring it up but we passed it. 
   I alert my colleagues, again, what goes around comes around. We are going to get this back. If you are against it, you had better come up with something else that is a better idea. Otherwise, it will stay in your State. If you want to get it out of your State in a permanent repository, you had better get behind this bill, if we have to go for a veto override. 
   I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I compliment my good friend, the senior Senator from West Virginia, for his attention to the energy crisis that clearly this Nation faces, and particularly his attention to the realization that we have become so dependent on imported energy which clearly affects our national security interests. 
   In 1973--this is a time the Senator would certainly remember, as many Americans do--as a consequence of the Arab oil embargo, we had a very significant event in the United States. We had gas lines around the block. Many younger people don't remember that time. We were 37-percent dependent on imported oil. We created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as a consequence of our concern, fearing we might approach 50 percent dependence. We fought a war in the Persian Gulf. At that time, I believe we were 47-percent dependent. 
   Today, this Nation is 56-percent dependent on imported oil. The Department of Energy forecasts by the year 2015 to 2020 we will be 65-percent dependent. I hope we can learn something from history; that is, that we lose our leverage if we become so dependent on that single source of imports. 
   As the Senator from West Virginia pointed out, we have many forms of energy in this country. We have coal, as the Senator notes; we have gas; we have hydro; we have nuclear. However, we don't have a cohesive energy policy. As a consequence, we face a crisis. The farmers in this country are getting ready to plant, and they are going to be facing high energy costs. We have seen truckers come to Washington, DC, and plead because they can't pass on the increased price of diesel to consumers. We have our Secretary of Energy in Nigeria, he was in Saudi Arabia, he has been to Mexico, urging they produce more oil. 
   What we need is a balance. We need a balance in domestic production of energy resources in this country, including coal, oil, and gas, using America's technology and America's know-how to develop these resources safely. 
   I commend my friend from West Virginia for bringing this matter to the attention of this body and recognizing that we have a capability in the United States to relieve our dependence on imported energy. The answer is not to go out and generate more imports; it is to generate more resources domestically. In his State of West Virginia and in my State of Alaska, we have a tremendous capacity to produce energy, if it is given the opportunity. We can do that because we have the advanced technology. He talks about clean coal technology. In our State of Alaska, we talk about drilling in the Arctic in the wintertime where you do not make a footprint because you are on top of the frozen ground. If there is no oil there, there is no scar, no footprint in the spring. 
   I have the obligation of managing some time this morning. Does the senior Senator from West Virginia have anything further to say?

   I believe there have been projects in Wyoming that have addressed the issue in general terms of clean coal, how it can be reformulated to reduce the moisture and generate higher Btu's. I wonder if the Senator could comment briefly as to the area in Wyoming, as well, that could be available for oil and gas and coal exploration but has been withdrawn by the administration, and the rationale behind that; if those areas were open, what they might contribute to lessen our dependence on imports.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend from Wyoming. 
   I believe the Senator from Maine seeks recognition, Ms. COLLINS. She represents a part of the country that has been very hard hit by high heating oil prices with a cold winter. 
   While we have seen excuses made relative to certain volumes of storage capacity being taken out of existence for heating oil because of age and the fact that they did not comply with current environmental requirements for fuel oil storage, we have seen refineries go out of existence. But the constituents in her area have been hit very hard. 
   It is my understanding that this year in the Northeast corridor there is a potential threat associated with high electric prices as a consequence of the likelihood that, indeed, some of the oil-fired plants are going to have to be put on line to meet peak demand. The costs associated with the high price of oil to fuel those plants will be passed on to the consumers in her areas, which puts a further burden on the residents of the Northeast corridor. As a consequence, that addresses the dilemma we have: Whether we are going to continue to rely on imports of energy or finally develop a balance with domestic alternatives. 
   How much time does the Senator from Maine need?

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Maine for an update on what has occurred as a  consequence of the crisis in the Northeast corridor and the implications associated with that in her area. I think she certainly has been diligent in attempting to bring about some relief for her area. It is unfortunate that the administration's answer seems to be soliciting more imports. Of course, those of us who follow this closely know that it is somewhere between 6 and 8 weeks before a barrel of oil that originates in Saudi Arabia is going to be available in her area for the benefit of relieving those who are subjected to the high prices of heating oil. 
   Before I recognize my friend from Texas who is seeking recognition on this subject, I remind my colleagues that there is going to be a lot of finger pointing as to who bears responsibility. The claim by the administration that they have been ``caught by surprise'' suggests that they must have been napping because evidence certainly shows that the President had knowledge of the extent of this crisis developing back in 1994, when the Independent Petroleum Association of America petitioned the Commerce Secretary, under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. Under that act, upon a request from an interested party, which the independent petroleum producers certainly were, the Secretary of Commerce must institute, over a 270-day period, an investigation into whether imports threaten U.S. national security. Then, if the Secretary determines such imports do threaten national security, the President has 3 months to disagree or agree and, if he agrees, to determine a response or a solution. 
   In 1994, the Independent Petroleum Association petitioned the Commerce Department. At that time, the late Secretary, Ron Brown, under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, responded. After study, the Department of Commerce found that imports did threaten the national security and reported this to our President. What was the President's response? I quote from the 1994 findings:  
   I am today concurring with the Department of Commerce and their finding that the Nation's growing reliance on imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products threatens the Nation's security because they increase U.S. vulnerability to oil supply interruptions.  
   Granted, that was in 1994, but something else happened in March of 1999. The Congress asked for a new section 232 finding on oil imports.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Further, I note that that particular letter is a bipartisan letter. Many Democrats as well as Republicans are on that letter, specifically asking, again, for a new finding on oil imports and pointing out that the domestic oil and gas industry was basically in a free-fall--this was March of 1999 --and that that free-fall would further threaten our national security. 
   In April of 1999, Secretary of Commerce Daley initiated the study. That study was delivered to the President last November. Now, the President has not released that study, but clearly that study is going to point out that national security is at risk because of our increasing dependence on imports. Why hasn't the White House released that report? 
   Yesterday the Majority leader, Senator LOTT, along with Senator WARNER, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator HELMS, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and myself wrote to the President laying out this sequence of facts 
   and asking the President to release that report that has been sitting on his desk since November. Now, he is required by law to do this within 90 days--which has past. So when I hear from the administration that they were caught by surprise, or caught napping, I can only assume they haven't been reading their mail, or they haven't been moving the reports, or they have decided they didn't want to bring this issue up before the American people, because they were told in 1994 and they were told again last November that we were risking our national security as a consequence of our import and dependence on foreign oil, which is now up to 56 percent. 
   The Department of Energy, in its own forecast last year, said in the years 2015 to 2020 we will probably be in the area of 65-percent dependent on imports. I am not buying the excuse that they were caught napping or caught by surprise. They were caught because they haven't done anything about it. They haven't wanted to do anything about it. They hoped they would get out of town before the American public became aware, before the crisis hit, before the farmers came to Washington, before the truck drivers came to Washington, before we had a surcharge on  our airline tickets, before we were approaching $2-a-gallon gasoline. But it has caught up with them. 
   It will be very interesting to hear what the White House is going to say now that they have this report under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act; they have had it since November. And why haven't they released it to the American people? 
   I ask the Senator from Texas how much time she will need. We have had 7 minutes. We have had 10 minutes. And we have a couple more speakers. Is 10 minutes adequate?

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend, the Senator from Oklahoma. I remind the Senator that in 1973 when we had the Arab oil embargo, we had a bipartisan effort to come together, to take steps to ensure we would never be over 50-percent dependent on imported oil. We created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Clearly we didn't follow what we were preaching at that time. I thank my friend from Oklahoma for his contribution. 
   In the remaining minutes, I will point out a couple of relevant facts I think Members need to be cognizant of. One of the short-term proposals that our energy caucus has come up with is to support a temporary suspension until year end of the 4.3-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax that was added in 1993. Some will remember we had a debate on the floor regarding that tax. We were tied on the 4.3-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax increase. Vice President GORE came to the floor and broke the tie. Some have taken the opportunity to suggest this is the Gore tax, the 4.3 cent a gallon. It amounted to a 30-percent tax increase on the gasoline. 
   We are proposing a temporary suspension. The proposal suggests we will not jeopardize any of the contracts that are outstanding for highway funding this year, that we will replace the offset by the end of the year through the general fund or surplus, or a combination of both, or perhaps if the price of oil should come down, we will do it that way. However, we clearly will not jeopardize the highway trust fund by this proposal. 
   Another reality I think is worth mentioning because it is very significant relates to the fact we are currently importing a significant amount of oil from Iraq. We fought a war over there not so many years ago. We lost 147 American lives of service men and women. The object was to expel Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. We have 458 Americans who were wounded; 23 were held prisoner of war. What has it cost the American taxpayer since the end of the Persian Gulf war to ensure that Saddam Hussein stays within his borders? A little over $10 billion--we were enforcing a no-fly zone; we were enforcing some embargoes. I mention this because of the inconsistency. 
   Now we are importing oil from Iraq. Our greatest percentage of growth in imports is coming from Iraq. In 1998, I think it was 336,000 barrels a day; In 1999, it is over twice that much. 
   Where is the consistency in our policy? We can condemn the Saudis for not increasing oil production. We can condemn the Mexicans. The Secretary of Energy went to the Saudis and said: We have an emergency, we need more production. 
   Do you know what they said? They will have a meeting on March 27 and let us know. He says: No, you do not understand. We have an emergency. And they said: No, we have a meeting.  
   He went to Mexico and begged for more production from Mexico. Do you know what the Mexicans said? They said: Where were you, United States, when oil was $13, $14, $15 a barrel and our economy was in the bag? 
   That is what we are hearing as a consequence of our dependence on this source. Some suggest we should consider pulling out troops if OPEC fails to raise production. Obviously, that is contrary to our own best interests, as well. 
   It is important to point out the inconsistencies associated with our policies and the realization we have allowed ourselves to become so dependent. We were aware of it as evidenced by the section 232 Trade Expansion Act report. The President had it in 1994 by the Department of Commerce and he had it last November and he has not chosen to release it. That is where we are. 
   I conclude by reminding my colleagues that things are probably going to get worse in some areas of the country. We had the Senator from Maine indicate the difficulties associated with heating oil. Let me advise the Northeast corridor that there may be higher electric generation prices coming this summer in their electric bills. Only 3 percent of the Nation's electricity comes from oil-fired generating plants, but in the Northeast corridor it is much higher. It is estimated that the older oil-fired plants will have to come online this summer and the price will go up because they use a uniform price method to set prices. 
   In other words, the last energy source that comes online dictates the price for the other sources and there is a windfall. In other words, those providing electricity using gas, which is cheaper, charge the same price as those generating electricity using oil. If I have not confused the President, I think he has an idea of the point: Electricity prices will go up in the Northeast. 
   The Northeast corridor relies 33 percent, I am told, on fuel oil for its power generation. By some estimates, an oil plant that offered electricity at $37 per megawatt hour 1 year ago may now seek a price of $75 or more--assuming fuel is purchased on the open market. It may be more as owners of oil units are free to ask whatever price desired. 
   If there were an abundance of power this would not be an issue, but there is not an abundance of power. It is very likely, according to the estimates we have received from sources in the industry, that every kind of generation available will likely be utilized this year in the Northeast corridor--including fuel-oil units. 
   The bottom line is that as long as OPEC controls the price of oil and we allow our domestic production to continue to decline, American consumers continue to pay the price. 
   The alternative is clear: We have to reduce our dependence on imported oil. To do that, we have to go across the breadth of our energy sources. We have to have the people in the Northeast corridor recognize the answer to their problem is more domestic production and less dependence on imported oil. That suggests an aggressive policy of opening up the overthrust belt in the Rocky Mountains, opening up Alaska, opening up OCS areas, and do it right, with the technology we have. Otherwise, this situation will happen again and again and again. The Northeast corridor will feel it first and foremost. 
   I thank the Presiding Officer for his patience and diligence in listening to the presentation.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I rise to recognize an Alaskan that has done so very much for his state and his community. I am referring to Mike Kelly, the President, General Manager and Chief Executive of Operations of Golden Valley Electric Association of Fairbanks, Alaska. You see Mr. Kelly retired last week after 33 years of service--the last 17 as President--service not just to his company, but to the citizens of Alaska. 
   Mr. Kelly is a recognized leader within Alaska's utility industry. Over the past three decades he has grown Interior Alaska's sole electric co-operative into a multi-million-dollar enterprise providing reliable electric service to more than 80,000 people. And providing dependable electric service in Alaska is no small feat. Keeping power flowing in a state where temperatures vary by 150 degrees between summer and winter and where high winds, blizzards and harsh conditions are common, requires skill, organization and perseverance. And his leadership is even more remarkable in that he has accomplished this level of excellence without raising his company's power rates once in the last 18 years. 
   Mr. Kelly has dedicated his career at GVEA to fighting for projects and progress that have benefitted consumers both in Alaska's Railbelt and in Alaska's remotest regions. He spearheaded GVEA's successful purchase of the Fairbanks Municipal Utilities System, has been the prime mover in the construction of the Northern (power) Intertie Project and has served well in many leadership positions within the industry and in the community of Fairbanks. 
   He has volunteered to share his skills and leadership with many organizations, including the Board of Regents of the University of Alaska, the Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce, the Rotary Club of Fairbanks, and the Fairbanks Industrial Development Corp.,  along with the Boards of Fairbanks Memorial Hospital Foundation and Denali State Bank. 
   He is the winner of the Northwest Public Power Association Raver Award (1986) for displaying outstanding community service through leadership. He was the 1999 recipient of the Mason Lazelle Award, the highest honor awarded by the industry in Alaska. And he has been singled out for well deserved recognition by the Associated Students of Business, the University of Alaska Fairbanks Alumni Association as the Outstanding Alumni of the Year, and by many other groups. 
   While Mr. Kelly now will have more time to spend on the river fishing, out hunting and with his family, I'm sure Alaska has not seen the last of his efforts on behalf of Fairbanks and the state has a whole. My congratulations go to him for his many accomplishments and Nancy and I offer our best wishes for a wonderful retirement. Alaska is a better place because of your service to your city and your state.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to establish a bilateral U.S. and Canadian commission to study the feasibility of extending the continental railroad system to Alaska via a land link through Canada. 
   Mr. President, there are three things critical to the establishment of long-term economic stability for any state, region or country. The first is the availability of resources necessary to the production of goods. The second is the availability of labor to manufacture those goods. And the third is the availability of transportation systems to get those goods to market. 
   My State of Alaska, unfortunately, remains deficient in the third of these critical elements. We have the resources, and we have the labor, but we do not yet have the same essential transportation infrastructure. 
   The idea of connecting the transcontinental rail system to Alaska is not a new one. The original congressional action to establish the Alaska Railroad called for laying 1,000 miles of track in Alaska, which would have been sufficient to carry it to the Alaska-Yukon border. Canada has at various times also looked at rail connections to the north country. Unfortunately, none of these have been carried through. 
   During World War II, the United States actually surveyed a route from Prince George, British Columbia all the way through Alaska to tidewater at Teller, on Alaska's Seward Peninsula. But again, this effort was never completed, largely due to wartime shortages of steel. 
   While someday it would be beneficial to follow through on that World War II plan, what I am proposing today is far less grandiose. 
   My bill would create a process for appointing members to the U.S. side of a bilateral commission to study the feasibility of extending the current continental rail system from its present terminus in British Columbia, through  the Yukon Territory, to the present terminus of the Alaska Railroad near Fairbanks. The distance to be traversed is on the order of 1,200 miles. Mr. President, this is not pie in the sky. I believe that the extension of the railroad would pay for itself, not immediately, but in the forseeable future. 
   The area through which the rail line would pass holds some of the richest mineral prospects in North America. The Yukon-Tanana uplands stretch from Fairbanks down through much of the Yukon. This heavily mineralized area holds gold, silver, copper, nickel, lead and zinc in great quantities, plus substantial amounts of other elements. Further south along the possible routes, there are large quantities of high value timber, and vast amounts of lower quality wood that we now utilize for paper, fiberboard and other products. 
   Mr. President, some individuals and organizations will no doubt argue against even exploring this prospect because of a bias against the use of natural resources, or opposition to ``development'' in the wilderness. To them I would suggest that the construction of a railroad is an opportunity to control development--to avoid areas of particular sensitivity--which would be impossible with other transportation systems. A rail line has far less of a ``footprint'' than even a one-lane road, and its stops are known quantities. Properly constructed, a rail line would make possible the development of vast resources, without creating the kind of uncontrolled situation that can lead to the degradation of highly valued wild lands. 
   Others may point to the current volume of freight moving to and from Alaska and say, ``There is no way such a tiny amount of freight can support a railroad.'' They would be missing the point. The question is not whether rail is a more effective means to carry the existing volume, it is whether access to rail would spur enough new economic activity to support the venture. I suggest that it might. Experts have suggested there may be the potential for up to 120 million tons of freight per year, which would be more than enough to pay back any investment. 
   I am not an expert. I cannot verify that contention, any more than I can refute it. That is why we need a comprehensive feasibility study. 
   In January, a conference to discuss the potential for such an extension was held in Vancouver, British Columbia. Participants were extraordinarily supportive, adopting a strong resolution in favor of proceeding with a joint U.S.-Canada study. 
   I have drawn from that resolution to prepare the legislation I am introducing today. Specifically, it would provide authorization to for a $6 million, five-year effort to refine our understanding of both the positives and the negatives of a rail extension. 
   This is in no way an attempt to second-guess the feasibility process. We need an objective, thorough survey of both costs and opportunities. 
   To that end, I am suggesting that the United States component of the commission include local government, business, academic and Alaska Native leaders with expertise in the relevant fields. I am confident that Canada will choose similarly well-qualified individuals for its own side of the commission. 
   Let's make no mistake about this--it is not universally supported, and I want my colleagues to be aware of that from the very beginning. Most of those who currently operate companies carrying goods to and from Alaska by truck and by water will find all kinds of reasons to suggest that there is no way a railroad can be made to work. 
   Mr. President, it is only natural that those with a vested interest in the status quo should oppose change. It is their absolute right to do so. But it is wrong to stifle debate. We should be free to accept and explore new ideas. That is what this commission is all about. 
   If the railroad connection is economically and environmentally and socially sound, then let's move ahead. If it is not, then let's drop it. But at the very least, let's give it an honest hearing. That's what this bill is about.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I want to talk a bit about the matter before us, the judicial nominations of Paez and Berzon. 
   I have listened to the debate today, and it is fair to say, to a large degree, the Ninth Circuit Court has made itself the target. The suggestion was made the Ninth Circuit is in the middle of the pack with regard to reversals. Thirty-three percent of the reversals over the last 3 years have come out of the Ninth Circuit Court. I have talked to judges in that court. They are so frustrated by the caseload and their inability to follow the cases in the court that they privately and publicly suggest something be done. 
   We have been at this for a long time. We have been discussing it, we have been arguing, we have been debating how we split it up. Naturally, California is a little reluctant to see it split up, for lots of reasons which I do not think are necessary to go into. 
   The reality is this body has an obligation of timely justice, and timely justice is not being done in the Ninth Circuit for a couple of reasons. It serves the largest population of all the circuits. The judges can't handle all the cases. Legal reasoning has been abandoned in favor of extremist views. The Ninth Circuit has invited this upon itself. 
   The point I make is, we have an obligation on our watch to do something about this problem. We have to do it. It is inevitable. 
   This week I introduced legislation to split the Ninth Circuit. These two nominees are perfect examples of why my bill should be passed immediately by this body. Senator HATCH and other are co-sponsoring this bill. 
   The Ninth Circuit is already plagued with a very activist group on the judiciary who bring their causes to the bench with them.  
   But let's look at the number of cases that have been reversed by the Supreme Court. This chart shows the number of cases reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court between 1997 and 1999. The statement has been made that the Ninth Circuit court is somewhere in the middle. It is more than the middle. The Ninth Circuit has almost a quarter of all the court reversals in all of our circuit courts. Next is followed by the Eighth Circuit and then the Fifth Circuit. It is not a factual statement to suggest that the reversals in the Ninth Circuit are somewhere in the middle. 
   We have another chart I will describe to you as the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, a court that is out of control. From 1994 to the year 2000, the number of decisions reversed, 86 percent; decisions upheld, 14 percent. 
   If this followed a pattern in the other circuit courts, I would not be up here arguing; but it is far too high. It suggests it is out of control. The reality is that 86 percent of the decisions were reversed in that period, from 1994 to the year 2000; and 14 percent of the decisions were upheld by the Supreme Court. These are people who were denied justice--at great cost. 
   Let's look at the reason why it is so obvious that we have to do something about it. It is the caseload. Look at the growth of the caseload. From 1991 through the year 2000, it has gone from 7,500 to 9,500. It continues to increase. What they will tell you is it is increasing beyond a manageable level. We all know something about managers and management. Some of us are better managers than others; some are worse than others. But you have some real problems when the judges cannot follow the decisions that are coming out of the court. They will be the first ones to acknowledge that. 
   Let me show you a chart referencing the population in relation to the other circuit courts because that is very important. The circuit courts are depicted on this chart--the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, currently the Ninth, the Tenth, and Eleventh. I want to move this chart up a little bit. I am not sure the Presiding Officer can see it. This is the story. It is cold, hard facts. 
   Here is the Ninth Circuit shown on the chart. It is almost off the chart. The Ninth Circuit will increase 26 percent by the year 2010. It is at 50 million now. That is the problem. We have to split it. The question is, who is going to accept the responsibility? Are we going to put it off? The longer we put it off, the less timely justice prevails. 
   We owe this to the residents of the States affected. They ought to have something to say about it. We are saying we want it changed. We do not hear that from California. But the other States say they want a change; they want an equitable change. 
   What have we done? We have reached out and tried to get opinions of people who know something about the problem. Everybody is an expert; and everybody can get an expert. But the Supreme Court agrees that reform is needed. How much higher do you have to go? 
   Here is what they say:  
   The disproportionate segment of this Court's discretionary docket that is consistently devoted to reviewing Ninth Circuit judgments, and reversing them by lop-sided margins, suggests that this error-reduction function is not being performed effectively.  
   That means justice is not being done. That is Justice Scalia.  
   With respect to the Ninth Circuit in particular, in my view the circuit is simply too large.  
   Isn't that what it shows? That is Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.  
   In my opinion the arguments in favor of dividing the Circuit into either two or three smaller circuits overwhelmingly outweigh the single serious objection to such a change.  
   These are the Supreme Court Justices who have to make these reversals. 
   I have another chart. You can read, at your leisure, what retired Supreme Court Chief Justice William Burger said.  
   I strongly believe that the 9th Circuit is far too cumbersome and it should be divided.  
   Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy:  
   I have increasing doubts and increasing reservations about the wisdom of retaining the Ninth Circuit in its historic size, and with its historic jurisdiction. We have very dedicated judges on that circuit, very scholarly judges ..... But I think institutionally, and from the collegial standpoint, that it is too large to have the discipline and control that's necessary for an effective circuit.  
   We have a hard enough time controlling discipline here, and there are only 100 of us--plus 100 egos. But I will not go into that.  
   We (the Ninth Circuit) cannot grow without limit ..... As the number of opinions increases.......  
   That is the Honorable Diarmuid O'Scannlain, a Ninth Circuit judge, I might add. 
   Our former colleague, Senator Mark O. Hatfield:  
   The increased likelihood of intracircuit conflicts is an important justification for splitting the Court.  
   There you have it, one of our own. 
   In my opinion, this matter before us is further evidence of the necessity of splitting the court. The circuit is already plagued with activists on the judiciary who bring their causes to the bench with them. I do not think that is appropriate. One simply has to look at the rate of reversals to find the proof. I have gone into that. Now is the time for Congress to stop this unwieldy circuit. I hope we will because our inaction is only going to weaken an already detached and out of control circuit. 
   Most shocking is that the nominees do little to deflect accusations that they share an activist judicial philosophy. Justice Paez, in his own words, stated that he ``appreciate[s] ..... the need of the courts to act when they must, when the issue has been generated as a result of the failure of the political process to resolve a certain political question.......'' 
   He then continues:  
   There's no choice but for the courts to resolve the question that perhaps ideally and preferably should be resolved through the legislative process.  
   I think that statement deserves a great deal of thought and consideration because he is implying that if we don't take care of it through the political process, this judge is going to simply take action into his own hands. I am not ready for that. That, to me, is a flag. 
   One does not have to be a legal scholar to see that this is a blatant infringement upon the Constitution, the Constitution we rely upon to protect ourselves from improper Government actions. Article I, as I know the Chair is familiar, clearly states that ``[a]ll legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States.'' Should this body abdicate its role and confirm nominees who openly defy the Constitution? I hope we will all answer with a resounding ``no.'' 
   Unfortunately, Judge Paez's background goes far beyond activist judicial decisions. I think we should all pause and reflect upon a nomination for which the director of the ACLU in Southern California states:  
   It's been a while since we had these kinds of appointments to the federal court. I think it's a welcome change after all the pro-law enforcement people we have seen appointed to the state and federal courts.  
   That sends another message to me. I am not sure this judge is going to have the balance necessary to protect our law enforcement people. They need a lot of protection. They are hit by the press. They are hit by mistakes. They are hit by the exposure they have out there, protecting our property and protecting us. We owe more to the men and women who risk their lives each and every day to maintain law and order. We owe more to Americans who see crime around every corner. There is a lot of it, and a lot of them see it. 
   Time and time again, Judge Paez has demonstrated a lack of proper judicial temperament. We should be able to agree that judges should be impartial and not speak out on matters that may appear before their court. I think we do agree on that. Yet Paez, during the California Proposition 209 ballot initiative debate which would have ended racial quotas and discrimination by the State government, labeled the proposal ``anti-civil rights'' and said it would ``inflame the issue all over again without contributing to any serious discussion.'' 
   I am realist enough to recognize that people in California and their elected representation have a better understanding of this than I do. It sounds a little strange and uncomfortable to me. 
   A judge is expected to remain impartial. Certainly, they should not comment upon efforts by the citizens of California, in their wisdom, to pass a  legal and constitutional ballot initiative. Judicial Cannon 4(A)(1) alone requires that a judge do nothing ``to cast reasonable doubt on the judge's capacity to act impartially as a judge.'' This is not a person who should be deciding cases that affect 50 million people in our circuit court. 
   Here, again, is the chart that shows the proof of why this court is out of control. 
   I also find it ironic that supporters of Marsha Berzon are the very people who claim to be advocates of campaign finance ``reform.'' It is interesting because there are some political overtones there. There probably are going to be some more. While quick to target political speech by national parties, they seem to have turned a blind eye to true injustice in our campaign finance system. I am referring to the forced speech that large and radical unions placed upon their willing members. Many of the union members acknowledge that privately; they are a little hesitant to do it publicly. 
   The majority has worked hard to open the workforce to all 
   Americans and to remove automatic payroll contributions to unions for political ads of which members disapprove. Shouldn't those members have a right? I think so. 
   Now the Clinton administration has sent us a judicial nominee who has been labeled by the National Right to Work Committee as the ``worst'' Clinton appointee in terms of labor issues. I wonder how objective that person is. 
   While representing the Nation's most powerful unions, Ms. Berzon stated that mandatory union dues ``implicates first amendment values only to a very limited degree.'' I wonder how limited that is. Thankfully, the Supreme Court struck down this logic in Communication Workers of America v. Beck. 
   Look at the Ninth Circuit's already startling reversal rate by the Supreme Court. In 1997, it was 95 percent. One can imagine an even more detached judiciary with the addition of Ms. Berzon. This period this chart shows is for the years 1994 through 2000: 86 percent of the decisions reversed, only 14 upheld. That is a reflection on the court, and it is a reflection on us for not doing something about it. 
   Mr. Paez is no stranger to the reform debate. During a time when we expect firm and fair enforcement of our Nation's financing laws, Judge Paez gave one individual an unusually light sentence after he admitted to accepting more than $250,000 in illegal campaign contributions. This is the largest acknowledged receipt of illegal contributions in congressional history, except for POGO maybe. We have 300-some-odd thousand in reward money out there that we have to investigate. There are going to be some heads rolling once that is made public and the public and this body understands how that system of whistleblowers works. What was the sentence? The sentence was 1 year on probation and 200 hours of community service. This is for $250,000 illegal campaign contributions. This is the real problem in campaign financing. 
   I could go on for a long time. I see the Senator from Maryland waiting to be recognized. I could continue listing the seemingly countless reasons why these two nominees should be rejected by this Senate. But, I find that unnecessary. There really is only one reason. Because the people of the Ninth Circuit deserve better. They deserve better. 
   They deserve a justice system that reflects the temperament of the society. They deserve a judiciary that creates dependable case law by following judicial precedent. They deserve a judiciary that provides swift yet fair justice. 
   Most importantly, they deserve a judiciary that follows the Constitution and the rule of law and objectivity. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to reject the two nominations before us prior to the vote this afternoon. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think I understand more than many the anger many Americans feel when they see gasoline pump prices at $1.80 a gallon or higher. But I also think it is unfortunate that the Clinton-Gore administration has, for 8 years, kind of lulled Americans into believing that an unlimited supply of relatively cheap gasoline will be available from our so-called friends in OPEC. 
   As a consequence of that false sense of security, America's soccer moms, with the idea of running the kids here and there, have gone out and spent tens of millions of dollars on sport utility vehicles that barely get 15 miles a gallon. With today's gas prices, they find when they fill up one of those SUVs that it can put a big hole in a $100 bill. It will cost $70 or $80. It is almost certain that gasoline will hit $2 a gallon this summer because our refineries are not refining gasoline because they are still refining heating oil. Since they have not shut down for the conversion, we won't have on hand the reserves necessary to meet the requirements for the families in this country who are used to driving long distances in the summertime. It is going to happen. We are going to get $2-a-gallon gasoline. 
   Americans I don't think should blame OPEC when the fault lies clearly with the Clinton-Gore administration and their energy policy, which is really no policy. They have no policy on coal, they have no policy on oil, and they have no policy on hydro other than it is nonrenewable, and they have no policy on natural gas. They say that is the savior. But they won't open up public land for oil and gas exploration, particularly in the upper belt of the Rocky Mountains, my State of Alaska, and the OCS areas. 
   What they propose is to put the Secretary of Energy on an airplane and send him over to Saudi Arabia with his hand out begging the Saudis to produce more oil. They made that trip; they made that request. And the Saudis said: We have a meeting of OPEC March 27. He said: No, you don't understand. There is an emergency in the United States. We need you to produce more oil. They said: You don't understand, Mr. Secretary. Our meeting is March 27. 
   That is hardly an adequate response to a nation that went over there and fought a war so that Saddam Hussein could not take over Kuwait. That war was about oil. 
   We sought relief from the non-OPEC nations of Mexico and Venezuela. The Mexicans said: Well, isn't it rather ironic, when oil was $11, 12, and $13 a barrel and the Mexican economy was in the tank and in shambles, where were the Americans? Was the administration trying to help us out? We weren't there. So we got stiffed. We got poked in the eye. 
   Now we see oil fluctuating from $34 a barrel a couple of days ago. It dropped $3. It went up again today. 
   The point is, we are dependent on imports and we are increasing that dependence. 
   Since the very first day this administration took office in 1993, they declared war on domestic energy producers. 
   The first proposal they sent to the Congress--this is very important, because some of you do not have a memory of 1993. But the Clinton administration proposed to the Congress a new $70 billion tax on fossil fuel produced in this country. That was a tax they planned with inflation indexing so that it would go up every single year. On top of that, they tried to add $8 billion in new motor fuel taxes and $1 billion in taxes on barge fuel. 
   Do you remember that, Mr. President? This Senator from Alaska does. A lot of folks in the administration would like us to forget that. I hope we will not forget that. 
   The Democratically-controlled Congress delivered to President Clinton $42 billion in new motor vehicle taxes in the form of a 30-percent gas tax increase. The Democratically-controlled Congress delivered to President Clinton $42 billion in new motor fuel taxes in the form of a 30-percent gas tax increase, and not a single Republican voted for that gas tax hike. We were joined by six Democrats, which resulted in what? A 50-50 tie vote. But the $42 billion gas tax hike became reality for every single American because the Vice President, AL GORE, cast the tie-breaking vote in favor of this tax hike. 
   That is a fact, and the RECORD will so note. 
   It will be interesting to hear his explanation. We heard an explanation not so long ago that, if elected, he would cancel the OCS leases. Where does he propose to get energy from, the tooth fairy? 
   I believe today, when gasoline is selling for more than $2 a gallon in some parts of the country, we should suspend the 30-percent Clinton/Gore tax increase. That is the least we can do to help the American motorist. We can make sure the highway trust fund is reimbursed for any lost revenue so we can ensure that all highway construction that is authorized will be constructed and that we don't jeopardize that. 
   I believe it is appropriate for this payback to the trust fund because the Clinton/Gore gas tax was not used for highway construction. It was used for government spending until Republicans took over Congress and authorized the tax to be restored for highway construction. 
   That is a short-term fix, but I think a realistic and achievable one. 
   Mr. President, barely a month ago, when heating oil prices were at their peak, what did the President propose? another $2.5 billion tax increase on the oil industry. Let me assure everyone in this chamber that those proposals are dead on arrival, as they should be. 
   It is not just higher energy taxes that the President demands. What has he done on the supply side? In a word, nothing. This administration has done nothing to open federal lands for exploration and development of oil and gas. 
   We should develop the overthrust belt of the Rocky Mountains and some of the OCS areas. The administration refuses to budge on the most promising oil field in America, ANWR. It is simply off limits. And they demand moratoriums on offshore, and on and on. 
   There is the story. Petroleum demands go up, and crude production goes down. That is where we are. It is as simple at that. 
   Mr. President, some people say that the administration does not have an energy policy. I would disagree with that statement. The Clinton-Gore administration does have an energy policy. It's goal is simply to stop energy production in the United States and make this country completely dependent on foreign oil. When Bill Clinton took office, we imported 43 percent of our oil. Today, foreign oil accounts for 56 percent of domestic consumption. 
   This isn't going to come as a surprise to the Department of Energy. The Department of Energy says the U.S. will be 65 percent in the year 2020--somewhere between 2010, 2015, and 2020. 
   That seems to be the goal of this administration rather than trying to do something about it. 
   And the predictable result of this irrational policy: We send the Secretary of Energy with hat in hand begging OPEC to raise production. The Sheiks in the Middle East must be laughing all the way to the bank as they contemplate how this administration has turned America into a dependent of OPEC. 
   They must view with mild amusement the irrational pie-in-the sky policies that this administration has tried to sell to the American people. Would this administration support building more nuclear facilities to reduce our dependence on OPEC? NO! 
   Would they support building new non-polluting hydro-electric facilities to reduce our dependence on OPEC? No. In fact, in what must be one of the most naive proposals from this Administration, they have been proposing tearing down dams that have been providing power for decades. Tearing down dams at a time when we are 56 percent dependent on imported oil is simply unconscionable. How would we replace this lost source of power? Does the administration support building more coal fired power plants? No. So how do President Clinton and Vice President GORE propose that we generate energy to run our industry and fuel our transportation system? Year in and year out what we hear from this administration is one word: Renewables--solar, wind, and geothermal. 
   I know the Administration is always emphasizing renewable energy as the best option. They are all important, but they constitute less than 4 percent of U.S. energy production and for the foreseeable future are not going to make a dent in our energy production. 
   I hope someday renewables will play a bigger role. We have to face reality. In 25 years, if there are technological breakthroughs, they may play a more important role, but today they have almost no role. 
   Face it: Today there are no solar airplanes; there are no economically feasible solar automobiles; there are no wind-powered, solar-powered trains. it gets dark in Alaska in the winter. None of these concepts is on the drawing board. The fact that the administration does not want to face up to this is evident up to now and in the foreseeable future. 
   This administration hopes they can get out of town before the crisis hits, the calamity of the American public asking: What have you done? You sold our energy security to the Saudis and some of the other Third World nations. 
   For 8 years, this administration has been blind to the facts and lived in a renewable dream world. Today, the American consumer is paying the price for the failed energy policies of the Clinton-Gore administration. 
   Today's gas prices may wake us up and call the country to the recognition that we have to begin to address, with long-term solutions, our energy security issues. If we don't do that, we may look back on March 2000 as the good old days when gasoline was only $1.70 a gallon. As we propose taking off this 4.3 percent, I look forward to the administration's response as to how the Vice President broke that tie. He and the administration are responsible for the tax costing the American consumer $43 billion.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me advise you, yesterday at the close of business, the posted price of oil was $34.13 a barrel. The Dow was down 374 points. The share price of one company, Procter & Gamble, plunged 30 percent as a consequence of their third quarter profits falling off because of the high cost of oil. 
   We have a crisis in this country. Today, I rise to introduce legislation on behalf of myself and 33 other Members that I believe, and they believe with me, offers the United States its best chance to reduce our dependence on foreign oil; that is, by producing more oil domestically. 
   We have seen the oil price rise in the last year from roughly $10 to over $30 a barrel. That is a pretty dramatic increase. There is an inflation factor associated with this. While we have not really addressed it, it is fair to say that for every $10 increase in the price of a barrel of oil, there is an inflation factor of about a half of 1 percent. Alan Greenspan has been quoted as saying, ``I have never seen a price spike on oil that I have ever ignored.'' 
   So we are now in a situation where we have seen heating oil prices in the Northeast reach historic highs this winter, nearly $2 a gallon. We are seeing a surcharge on our airline tickets of $20. You do not see it at the counter where you buy your ticket; of course not. You do not know what the price of a ticket generally is because they have so many prices between point A and point B. But it is there. It is $20. The American public ought to be questioning that. They at least ought to be aware of it, if they do not question it. 
   Regarding diesel prices, we saw the truckers come to Washington, DC. Diesel prices are the highest since the Department of Energy began tracking. 
   We are in a crisis. We have to do something about it. There are many factors that contribute to the price structure of each particular fuel, but underlying all of these, without a doubt, is our reliance on imported crude oil. We are 56-percent dependent on foreign crude oil. The current reserves indicate we are consuming twice as much crude in the U.S., as we are able to produce domestically. 
   I had the professional staff of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee trying to do a forecast, with the Department of Energy--we have a net decline because we are using more crude reserves than we are bringing in--about what time the bear goes through the buckwheat; that is, when perhaps we are looking at $2 a gallon, $2.50 a gallon for gasoline. Relief is not in sight as yet. 
   The worst part of it is this did not come without some warning. Those of us from oil-producing States, my State of Alaska, the overthrust belt--Louisiana Senators, Texas, Mississippi, other areas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Utah, Wyoming--have been predicting the dangers of increased dependence on imported oil. The administration, Department of Energy, has forecast by the years 2015 to 2020 we will be approaching 65-percent dependence on imported oil. The problem with that is it looks now as if that is a goal rather than a forecast. They are not taking any steps to relieve us of that dependency. 
   The facts, I think, are staggering. If you look at what is happening in this country, domestic production has decreased 17 percent since 1990. That is a fact. Consumption, however, has increased 14 percent. I have a chart to show this. It shows, I think very clearly, what is happening in this country. 
   We are seeing the demand, and that is the black line here, going, in 1990, from 16 million to 19 million barrels per day. So what is happening is we see a constant demand going up. Then what happens on the offset? Where is the crude production? The crude production is declining, from 7.4 to a domestic production of 5.9. 
   This reflects the reality of what has been happening. This 
   should not come as a great surprise to the Department of Energy, the Clinton administration, or the Congress of the United States. This has been coming for some time. 
   In one year, total petroleum net imports rose 7.6 percent. So, as we look for relief, we look towards imports. Now we are 56-percent dependent. What does it mean? It means we do not learn from history. We do not learn much. In 1973, when we had the Arab oil embargo--some people remember the gasoline lines around the block--at that time, we were 37-percent dependent on imported oil. We said it would never happen again. We said we would create a Strategic Petroleum Reserve to ensure we were not held hostage. 
   What did other countries do? Different things. The French, for example, said they would never be held hostage by the Mideast again, and they departed on a nuclear program so that today the French are over 90-percent dependent on nuclear energy. We do not have that situation in the United States. I simply point that out to direct attention to what some countries have done with their energy policy vis-a-vis others. What we have done is very little. 
   We fought a war over in the Mideast, didn't we? We fought that war, Desert Storm, to keep Saddam Hussein from invading Kuwait and taking over those oil fields. During Desert Storm, we were 46-percent dependent. Today we are held hostage to aggressive OPEC pricing policies. What has our response been? 
   Secretary of Energy Richardson went to the Mideast. Some suggest it was the greatest hostage recovery effort since the Carter administration sent the military to Tehran. He went there and said: We have an emergency in the United States. We have a crisis. We need you to produce more oil. 
   Do you know what they told him? They looked him in the eye and they said: We are going to have a meeting March 27 and we will address our policies then. 
   That is hardly responding to an emergency, particularly at a time when he reminded them of how quickly  we responded to the emergency when Saddam Hussein was about to invade Kuwait. Nevertheless, that is reality, that is business, that is the attitude of OPEC. This time the hostage is our country, our energy security--and the rescue mission is flawed. 
   We can look to the non-OPEC countries for relief. We can look to Venezuela. We can look to Mexico. 
   I happened to have a little feedback from Mexico. We went down to Mexico. The Secretary met with them and said we need you to produce more oil. There was a message, and that message that came back from Mexico is: Where was the United States when the Mexican economy was in the tank? When oil was selling at $11 a barrel, were you, the United States, doing anything to help out Mexico and its economy? Clearly, we were not. We were very happy to get $11, $12 oil. 
   So somebody said: If the shoe fits, wear it. 
   We have been stiffed. We have been poked in the eye because OPEC is saying: Ho, ho, the United States--do you know what the United States could do, if they wanted to do a favor for the consumer? They can waive all their taxes, waive all the highway taxes, waive all the State taxes. That will bring the price down. 
   It is an interesting suggestion. Obviously, it is unacceptable to us and an indignity, but I think it is sobering to recognize that is their proposed answer. 
   The irony that Iraq has emerged as the fastest growing source of U.S. oil imports is something beyond comprehension. We need to question where we are placing the Nation's energy security. Are we placing it with Saddam Hussein? That is where our imported oil is coming. 
   Our own Government agencies question this policy. Isn't that interesting? They question the policy they make. 
   Here is the statement on a chart. This is at a time when the administration is suppressing domestic production. This is from the Minerals Management Service:  
   Much of the imported oil that the United States depends on comes from areas of the world that may be hostile to the interest of the United States and where political instability is a concern.  
   That speaks for itself. The Mideast is unstable. We see our friends in Libya, Iran, Iraq, and now the relationship between Iran and Iraq seems to be closer than it ever was. We are caught in the middle. 
   In the meantime, What has happened to our domestic industry? It is interesting. We have seen in the oil industry a 28-percent decline in jobs, a 77-percent decline in oil rigs that are used in exploration, and we have seen a 7-percent decline in reserves. That is the largest decline in 53 years. 
   This is what we are doing, particularly under this administration, relative to encouraging domestic exploration and drilling: Rigs drilling for oil are down from 657 in 1990 to roughly 153 in 2000. 
   What has our energy policy been under the Clinton-Gore administration? Coal: Highly dependent on coal. But EPA filed a lawsuit against eight electric utilities with coal-fired powerplants. The lawsuit says these plants have been allowed to extend beyond their lifespan, and the management says they are trying to maintain these plants according to the permitting process and not necessarily extending their life. 
   One gets a different point of view, but clearly there is going to be employment for a lot of attorneys. 
   Hydro: Secretary Babbitt wants to be the first Secretary to tear down dams. It is estimated by my colleagues from the Pacific Northwest that if the dams go down, we are going to see roughly 2,000 trucks per day on the highways to replace the barge service, particularly in Oregon, and the environmental air quality and congestion issues will be significant. 
   Nuclear power: The administration opposes this. They do not want to address what they are going to do with nuclear waste on their watch. 
   Natural gas: It is the fuel of the future, but they have closed so much of the public lands; 60 percent of the overthrust belt is off limits in the Rocky Mountain area, which is Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Utah, New Mexico, North Dakota, and South Dakota. They estimate there is 137 trillion cubic feet of gas out there. And as a consequence, but they have put 60 percent of the area off limits. 
   Let's look at one more thing. If we look at our reliance on natural gas and oil, we recognize that we are not going to change over the next 20 or 25 years, as much as we would like to have greater dependence on alternative energy sources. The realization is the technology is not there. We have to continue to encourage them. The real answer is long-term and short-term relief. There is some short-term potential relief in repealing the Clinton-Gore gas tax hike. With prices at the pump steadily rising, one thing we can do is suspend the 4.3 cent-per-gallon Clinton-Gore gas tax. That came in 1993. The Democratic Congress, without a single 
   Republican vote, adopted the Clinton-Gore gas tax as part of one of the largest tax increases in history. 
   That tax has cost the American motorist $43 billion over the last 6 years. We can suspend this tax until the end of the year when prices may be stabilized, and we can make sure the highway trust fund is reimbursed for any lost revenue so we can ensure all highway construction authorized will be constructed. 
   It is interesting to note that when Clinton-Gore passed this tax, it was not used for highway construction; it was used for Government spending, until Republicans took over Congress and authorized the tax to be restored for highway construction. 
   Long-term fixes: We need to stimulate the domestic oil and gas industry. We need to get in the overthrust belt. We need the Department of Interior to open up these areas, and we need a long-term fix. It involves legislation that I am introducing to authorize the opening of the Coastal Plain. 
   I will show my colleagues what I am talking about. This is an area that lies in the northeast corner of Alaska, north of the Arctic Circle, 1,300 miles south of the North Pole. The pipeline of Prudhoe Bay over the last 30 years has produced 25 percent of the total crude oil produced in this country. 
   I will show another chart because we have to put this area in perspective, otherwise you lose it. 
   The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge consists of 19 million acres in its entirety. We have set aside in wilderness permanently 8 million acres. We set another 9.5 million acres in refuge, permanently--no drilling, nothing in those two areas. But Congress set aside what they call the 1002 area, the Coastal Plain, for a determination of whether or not to open it for competitive oil and gas bids. The Eskimo people of Kaktovik, a little village there, support exploration in this area. The geologists say it is the most likely area for a significant find. 
   We propose a competitive lease sale. We propose only exploration in the wintertime, that way we will make no footprint on the ground. There is roughly 1.5 million acres on the Coastal Plain. The industry says if they are allowed to develop it with the technology they have, they will use less than 2,000 acres in the entirety of the 1.5 million acres. That is the kind of footprint the technology gives us. 
   As we look at national energy security, we have to look at some long-term solutions because Prudhoe Bay, as can be seen on this chart, shows a good degree of compatibility with abundant wildlife. This shows Prudhoe Bay field and the caribou wandering around. This is the pipeline that goes 800 miles to Valdez. If the oil is where we think it is, we simply extend the pipeline over to Prudhoe Bay and produce it. 
   This chart shows what frequently happens on the pipeline. Here are some bears going for a little walk on the pipeline enjoying the afternoon. They get away from bugs and flies, and it is easier walking on the pipeline than it is in the heavy snow. They know what they are doing. 
   I conclude by recognizing in October our Vice President made a statement that he is going to do everything in his power to make sure there is no new drilling off our coastal areas relative to OCS lease sales. I think that statement is going to come back and haunt the administration and certainly haunt the Vice President because if we do not go for OCS activities, we are not going to go anywhere.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I encourage my colleagues to look at this legislation and recognize that we have to decrease our dependence on imported oil. The best way to do that is to stimulate domestic production here at home. The Coastal Plain of ANWR is one way to do it. 
   I thank the Chair and wish everybody a good day.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, soon we are going to be debating judicial nominations in this body. I want to take this opportunity to address what I consider a grave problem affecting the administration of justice in our Nation. 
   I am referring to the unwieldy Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Some will prefer the status quo, and I hope after my presentation this morning they will share in the recognition that the Ninth Circuit demands reform. The Ninth Circuit has grown so large and has drifted so far from prudent legal reasoning, that sweeping change is in order. 
   Congress has already recognized that change is needed. In 1997, we commissioned a report on structural alternatives for the Federal courts of appeals. The Commission, chaired by former Supreme Court Justice Byron White, found numerous faults within the Ninth Circuit. In its conclusion, the Commission recommended major reforms and a drastic reorganization of the Circuit. 
   For this reason, I, along with my distinguished colleague from Washington, Senator SLADE GORTON, introduced S. 253, the Federal Ninth Circuit Reorganization Act of 1999, which would in effectuate the recommendations of the White commission. 
   The bill would reorganize the Ninth Circuit into three regional divisions, designed as the northern, middle, and southern divisions, and a nonregional circuit division. Ideally, a more cohesive judicial body would emerge--one that reflects the community it serves, and holds a greater master of applicable, but unique, state law and state issues. 
   Some in this body were not too happy with the divisional realignment. Perhaps a more direct and simplified solution to the problems of the Ninth Circuit is in order. For this reason, I, along with my colleague, Senator HATCH of Utah, introduced a new bill this morning, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Reorganization Act of 2000. We are joined by Senator CRAIG, Senator CRAPO, Senator INHOFE, and Senator SMITH of Oregon. 
   This bill will divide the Ninth Circuit into two independent circuits. The new Ninth Circuit would contain Arizona, California, and Nevada. A new Twelfth Circuit would be composed of Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands. Immediately upon enactment, the concerns of the White Commission will be addressed, and a more cohesive, efficient, and predictable judiciary will emerge. 
   In this debate, let us not forget why change is in order. The Ninth Circuit extends from the Arctic Circle to the Mexican border. It spans the tropics of Hawaii and across the International Dateline to Guam and the Mariana Islands. Encompassing some 14 million square miles, the Ninth Circuit, by any means of measure, is the largest of all our U.S. courts of appeal. It is larger than the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Circuits combined. 
   Let me refer to chart one because I think it makes the point that the Ninth Circuit serves a population of more than 50 million, almost 60 percent more than are served by the next largest circuit court. By the year 2010, the Census Bureau estimates the Ninth Circuit population will be more than 63 million. Mind you, it is now 50 million--63 million. That is an increase of 26 percent in just 10 years.  
   I wonder how many people this court has to serve before Congress will realize the court is simply overwhelmed by its population. That is a fact. 
   I must confess our efforts in this case are not novel. Calls to split the Ninth Circuit Court have been heard since 1891. More to the point, Congress has attempted to reorganize the Ninth Circuit since World War II! 
   Congressional Members are not alone in advocating a split. In 1973, the Congressional Commission on the Revision of the Federal Court of Appellate System recommended that Congress split the Ninth Circuit. That was 1973. Unfortunately, Congress never effectuated the recommendations. Over the years, many legislative efforts have been made to correct the Ninth Circuit problems. Still, no 
   solution. Now, in a new millennium, the problems of the Ninth Circuit still exist and have even grown worse. 
   Mr. President, justice bears the price for Congress' inaction. The time for action is long overdue. 
   Because of the circuit's massive size, there is a natural decrease in the ability of the judges to keep abreast of legal developments within the Ninth Circuit. I encourage my colleagues to contact some of those judges--they will be the first to admit they cannot follow the number of cases pending before the court. It simply is too great a load. Inconsistent decisions and improper constitutional interpretations are not unusual. 
   Let's look at the next chart. In the 1996-1997 session alone, an astounding 95 percent of the cases reviewed by the Supreme Court were overturned. This number should raise more than a few eyebrows. That is from 1996 and 1997. Again, 95 percent of cases reviewed by the Supreme Court were overturned. 
   Looking at chart 2, over the past 3 years, 33 percent of all cases reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court arose from this troubled Ninth Circuit. That is three times the number of reversals for the next nearest circuit court, and 33 times higher than the reversal rate for the Tenth Circuit. 
   There you have it. Compare the courts, caseloads, and the question of promptness in justice. 
   What are these reversal cases? These are people who had their cases wrongly decided. They are people who had to incur great expense, wait unnecessary lengths of time, and risk adverse legal rulings in order to receive justice. No American should have to receive substandard legal attention based, solely on what State they live in. 
   But we cannot fault the judges of the Ninth Circuit alone. We, in Congress, have allowed this circuit to grow to staggering proportions. In 1998, there were over 9,450 cases filed. It is this number that makes adjudication of claims unacceptably slow. Consequently justice suffers.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that will ease the financial hardships that fisherman endure because of the uncertainties of their industry. I am very pleased that Senator STEVENS has joined me in co-sponsoring this legislation. 
   Mr. President, in 1986 when Congress rewrote the tax law and cut the number of tax brackets from 11 to two, one of the provisions of prior law that was repealed was income averaging. The purpose of income averaging was to ameliorate the tax burden on individuals whose incomes varied from year to year. It ensured that an individual whose income increased significantly in one year and then dropped significantly in the next year could average the tax brackets for the two years. With only two brackets, many believed that income averaging was no longer needed. 
   However, in the 14 years since the 1986 tax reform, we have added three additional brackets to the tax code. And with five brackets there is a clear need for income averaging, especially for individuals who are in occupations where the predictability of income is uncertain. In 1997, we adopted income averaging for farmers because we recognized that weather conditions can significantly impact what a farming family earns in any particular year. 
   In this legislation we are introducing today, we are adding fishermen to the category eligible for income averaging. Just as farmers cannot predict the weather, fisherman are unable to predict how large or small their catch will be. 
   Let me give you an example of how the fishermen in Bristol Bay in my home state of Alaska have fared in recent years. Between 1995 and 1998, the fish run dropped from 244 million to barely 58 million last year. At the same time their income has dropped from $188 million to $69 million.  
   Quite frankly, income averaging is fair for farmers and is equally justified for fishermen. 
   In addition, our legislation establishes risk management savings accounts which fishermen will be able to draw down when fishing runs are low. Under this proposal, fishermen could set aside up to 20 percent of their income in special savings accounts. Interest earned in the account would be taxable, but withdrawals would only be taxable in the year of the withdrawal. 
   Mr. President, a recent fishery failure in Alaska resulted in the federal government allocate $50 million to assist the fishermen and their local communities. With these special risk management accounts, fishermen will be less dependent on federal assistance and will be able to more easily survive fishing downturns. 
   Mr. President, it is my hope that when we consider a tax bill later this year, these modest proposals will be included in that bill.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, Friday, the price of oil exceeded $30. It was close to $31.26. That is high--not necessarily an all-time high, but it is pretty close. 
   Back in 1973, when we had the Arab oil embargo, the prices were in that neighborhood. A lot of people don't remember 1973, or the consequences of the Arab oil embargo; but for those who do, it was a day of reckoning. It was at a time when you went to the gas station to fill up and you waited--not just a little while, but in some cases a couple of hours. You stood in line because gasoline was short in this country. 
   There was an indignant response from the American public that never again would we be so dependent on imported oil from other countries. As a consequence, at that time, we formed the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The important thing to note is that in 1973 we were about 37 percent dependent on imported oil. 
   The idea of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve was to have a supply of oil on hand in case there was an interruption on our imports and we could have that oil available for use to meet that emergency. That was in 1973. 
   Today, in the year 2000, we are approximately 56 percent dependent on imported oil. The Department of Energy has indicated by the year 2015 to 2020, we will probably be dependent to the tune of about 65 percent. Now, the question, of course, from the standpoint of our national energy security interests, is: What are the implications of this? What are the ramifications of our increasing dependence on imported oil? 
   Clearly, the pricing structure is determined by the availability of oil from the producing countries that have an excess capacity. That is primarily in the Mideast. We have seen the efforts by both Iran and Iraq to cut production. It is interesting that between those two countries, they account for about 8 percent of the world's 75 million barrels of daily oil production. But now we see Baghdad and Teheran in a new position of power and influence to push their separate agendas in various ways. 
   We have OPEC. We know the significance of what that cartel controls. They decided to have a meeting to address our emergency. The irony of that is, that meeting is going to take place on March 27, which is hardly responding to our emergency. 
   As a matter of fact, our Secretary of Energy traveled extensively through the Mideast, meeting with the OPEC ministers, encouraging them to produce more oil so we will not see the price escalation that is currently occurring. 
   The results of that meeting were that we could expect some relief from Venezuela and Mexico. Both countries, of course, are outside of OPEC, but they wanted to remind us of something, and they communicated a little message. This didn't come from the Secretary of Energy, but it came from those who have had an opportunity to relate to both Mexico and Venezuela with regard to oil prices. On the manner in which we came and pled for more production, the Mexicans and the Venezuelans said: Where were you when we were going broke selling our oil at $11 and $12? Were you giving us any assistance? Were you encouraging higher prices so we could maintain our economy? Certainly not. That was not the case at all. 
   Now when we see oil at $30, we go to Mexico and we go to Venezuela, and say: We need increased production. But they are reminding us that we weren't at all concerned when the price was low, and when their economy was in collapse, they couldn't count on the United States. 
   Those are the dangers of that kind of dependence. 
   Now we are seeing OPEC on March 27 perhaps responding to increased oil production. But it is a little more complex than that because there are wheels within wheels in OPEC and relationships within relationships. 
   Kuwait this weekend signaled its support for an agreement to boost production. Remember, it wasn't so long ago that we fought a war against Saddam Hussein. It was a war over oil to keep that country, Kuwait, from being taken over by Saddam Hussein and Iraq. 
   We are now seeing within Iran and Iraq a group of price hawks, if you will, within OPEC. They are going to do what is best for their country--not what is best for the United States. Teheran has said that this is not the time to increase output because demand typically declines and higher production could lead to a quick collapse of prices. They are certainly looking out for their own best interests. Iran, with 3.5 million barrels of daily production, is at about its maximum, analysts say. 
   Since we are talking about bedfellows, let's talk about Algeria and Libya. They also have little reason in the short term to care about the world's economy, or the United States economy specifically. 
   An interesting suggestion is in this report from the Wall Street Journal. If the United States wants to lower its price of gasoline, it should reduce its taxes. That is their answer. They simply want to reduce our highway taxes and our other taxes and our State taxes that are associated with the price of oil. They say that if we really care about higher prices, we should simply eliminate our taxes. That is an interesting point of view. 
   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest producer of oil and an OPEC shareholder, has a special interest in keeping Iran happy now because relations between those countries are at their 
   best since the Iranian revolution in 1979. 
   We see countries within OPEC working for their own best interests and not necessarily what is good for the United States. The Saudis have been more responsive in the past, but not necessarily at this time because of their relationship with Iran. 
   OPEC producers want to continue the cartel's new-found unity because it funds the cash-flow. Wouldn't you rather produce more oil at a higher price to meet your cash-flow than a lot of oil at lower prices? That is just what they are doing. 
   We are seeing the role of OPEC and our neighbors in Mexico, Venezuela, and other countries evaluating the kind of response they are going to make to the United States at this time of emergency. 
   Over the last decade--most of it under the Clinton administration--production has decreased 17 percent and consumption has increased 14 percent. That is the reality of what has occurred in this country because we have not had an energy policy. We do not have an energy policy on coal. We do not have an energy policy on natural gas. 
   We just saw the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission basically kill prospects for a gas line in the Northeast corridor by making it economically unattractive for investors. We have an administration that suggests hydro is nonrenewable. It wants to take dams down in the Pacific Northwest. So we look at oil, we look at gas, we look at hydro, and we look at coal; there is no energy policy of any consequence. 
   Renewables are something we all support. But the reality is they contribute less than 4 percent of the total energy consumed in this country, and the prospects, while encouraging, are not going to give us the immediate relief we need. 
   As a consequence, we are experiencing a shock. The American public, when it drives down to the gas station to fill up the family Blazer or sports vehicle, may find itself subjected to a situation where it makes a pretty good hole in a $100 bill if it takes a 40-gallon gas tank at $2 a gallon, or thereabouts. 
   We also have a couple of other considerations. We have the potential for added inflation. Somebody made the interesting observation that if you consider the cost and availability of labor, if you consider the cost of money--namely, interest rates that have been going up--and the cost of energy, you have the three factors for inflation. It has been estimated that for every $10 increase in the price of oil, inflation increases one-half percent.  
   It is a very real threat to our economy, a very real exposure to our consumers out there, and I don't think we realize what is ahead. Not too many people know that every time they get in the airplane now, they are paying a $20 surcharge on that airline ticket, whether they go from here to Seattle or from here to Baltimore. The Northeast corridor has felt the impact of $2 a gallon for heating oil. 
   The question is, Is it going to get worse? The answer is, probably. When can we get relief? The question is whether we want to just depend on the Mideast or whether we want to reduce our dependence on imported oil. 
   There are many areas of this country over the overthrust belt of the Rocky Mountains--Utah, Montana, North Dakota, New Mexico, Wyoming, and my State of Alaska--where we have a tremendous abundance of oil and gas if given the opportunity to initiate exploration. 
   This is not supported by President Clinton. I am glad to say it is supported by some of the Republican candidates running for President. 
   The point is, what are we going to learn from history? Some say not much. If the Department of Energy predicts we will be 65-percent dependent in the years 2015 to 2020, should we not be doing something about it now? We should be committed to a policy of reducing our dependence on imported energy sources by developing sources in the United States. My State of Alaska, in the ANWR area, has an estimated 16 billion barrels. That would be an amount equal to what Saudi Arabia exports to America over an estimated 30-year timeframe. 
   We have areas in Louisiana, in Texas, and other coastal States that want to have OCS activity, yet we have an administration that does not support that activity. That is, indeed, unfortunate. 
   The bottom line is, when are we going to wake up? When will we relieve our dependency on imported oil? I might add, for those who think imported oil is the answer from an environmental point of view, it is estimated that from the year 2015 to 2020, it will take more than 30 tankers, 500,000 barrels each, docking every day in the United States, to supply that increase; that would be 10,000 ships per year. If that is not an environmental risk, I suggest anyone check the registration of the ships because they will be foreign ships. 
   Finally, in 1990 we had 657 rigs working in this country; today we have 153. In 1990, we had 405,000 jobs in the oil industry; today we have 293,000, a 28-percent decline. 
   If one considers the makeup of our trade deficit, a trade deficit of $300 billion, $100 billion is the cost of imported oil. 
   I encourage my colleagues to recognize that it is time to move. It is time to address opportunities to relieve our dependence on imported oil with meaningful proposals on the basic premise that charity begins at home.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 2000 with my colleague and the ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Senator BINGAMAN. 
   For over 40 years the Price-Anderson Act has provided a comprehensive system of liability coverage for nuclear incidents and has been extended three times since 1957, most recently in 1988. The act's authority to extend new coverage will expire on August 1, 2002, and I believe that it is important that we extend the authorities well in advance of that date. 
   When we reauthorized the law in 1988, we asked both the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to review the Act and submit reports assessing its value and the need for further extension as well as making recommendations for any necessary changes. Both agencies recommended that the Act be extended with only minor changes. This legislation makes those relatively minor modifications and extends the authorization for an additional ten years. 
   Mr. President, the Price-Anderson Act is an important aspect of the development of nuclear energy in the United States. If we are going to meet any of the emission goals set forth for our domestic electricity production, then nuclear power necessarily must remain a vital component of any energy policy. The Price-Anderson Act is essential to allow contractors and suppliers to prudently take the financial risks associated with nuclear activities for the Department of Energy as well as those undertaken by commercial nuclear facilities licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The Price-Anderson Act provides important protections to the public in the unlikely case of a nuclear incident. This legislation will extend those protections as well as making other necessary amendments to the Act. 
   I fully support this legislation and I hope that we can have it enacted expeditiously.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my colleague, the Chairman of the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, for addressing this matter and clarifying our understanding that this legislation does not alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. 
   I would also like to note that the authorization of appropriations contained in section 3 of S. 935 clarifies that money may be appropriated for the biomass research and development activities described in the bill pursuant to the existing general authority of the Secretary of Energy to fund biomass research and development, and does not create a new specific level of authorization for this program.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I listened to my colleague from South Carolina outline the state of the budget. I concur with his pointed criticism of whether or not we have a sound surplus, or whether it is somewhat realistic. 
   He points out the $19 billion that has been paid by the ratepayers into the nuclear waste fund, as an example. He and I both know that money has gone into the general fund. It is basically not in escrow. It is not in a reserve account. 
   When the administration or the Government ever addresses that responsibility, we will have to appropriate that money someplace because it has been spent. As an old banker, I can tell you that interest is like a horse that eats while you sleep. It goes on Saturday night, Sunday morning, and Sunday night. As a consequence, we often find ourselves in the position where the interest exceeds the principal. When that happens, you are broke. 
   I am certainly sympathetic to the points raised by my colleague.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce an electric deregulation bill, which it is my sincere hope will reduce the burdens on our electric ratepayers and consumers throughout this country by promoting competition and reliability in the electric power industry. 
   First, let me say competition isn't the goal of the legislation. Instead, competition is the means to achieve the goal of assuring customers reliable and reasonably-priced electricity. 
   We have seen the benefits of competition in other industries such as natural gas, telecommunications, trucking, and even in the airlines. In each case, competition reduced prices. That was the objective--to enhance supply and to encourage innovation. 
   There is every reason to expect that competition in the electric industry will benefit consumers. The Department of Energy agrees. It is projecting consumer savings in the area of $20 billion per year. That is not hay. That would be a significant savings to the consumers in this country, particularly important at a time when we are seeing spiking rates in oil, high gasoline prices, high heating oil prices, and high diesel fuel prices, as noted by the trucking industry that recently demonstrated here in Washington, DC. Heating oil prices are spiraling in the Northeast corridor. 
   We are talking about, through electric deregulation, trying to bring about consumer savings of $20 billion per year or more. Progress has already been made in this area, both in retail competition and wholesale competition because there has been innovation. Twenty-four States have already adopted retail competition. That covers nearly 60 percent of our consumers. All other States are now giving it consideration. As a consequence of the innovation of  the States, we are now seeing retail competition becoming a reality. 
   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has created wholesale competition in the interstate market through Order 888. 
   The legislative task we face--I, as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and my colleagues on that committee, both the minority and the majority--will be significant. We look forward to the task ahead. It will call for the examination of this bill, as a comprehensive bill, to try to address the various concerns, as well as take up the other bills. 
   However, I recognize there will be certain areas on which we will not be able to reach agreement. We can set them aside and proceed on what we can agree on, then go back one more time and look at those items we are still hung up on to see if we can generate any consensus. At that point, we can see what we have. Hopefully, it will be still meaningful. 
   As I said, the legislative task before the Senate is building on the progress that has been made with the States, not halting State progress on retail competition, and not interfering with the FERC process on wholesale competition. 
   The question is: How do we get there from here? How do we move the electric power industry from regulation to competition? Some argue we should preempt the States; I don't think so. Some say that we should substitute FERC regulation for State regulation; I don't think so. Others have the theory that one size fits all; I don't think so. 
   I think the States and the innovative attitudes coming out of the States indicate that one size does not fit all. We do not want to simply substitute one regulation for another. That is not deregulation. If that is done, it is just ``different'' regulation. Moreover, what may work in one State undoubtedly won't work in another State and the consumers would be harmed. 
   To me, the answer is obvious. For consumers to enjoy the benefits of competition, we have to let the free market system work. We have seen that time and time again. We must stop having regulators pick the winners and losers, regulators making decisions that should be made in the marketplace. 
   I have long said the best way to move toward market competition is to deregulate in those areas we can, streamline what we cannot deregulate, and facilitate States moving forward on retail competition. 
   I would prefer deregulating the entire electric power industry. However, I recognize some regulation must remain because it is necessary to protect consumers. Traditionally, States have regulated retail matters directly affecting consumers and FERC has regulated matters in interstate commerce. The legislation I introduce today retains this traditional division of authority between the States and FERC. 
   I believe that where regulation is necessary, it should be pursued by the unit of government that is closest to the consumer. The government that is closest to the citizen, is the government that will be the most responsive to citizens. Citizens go down to city hall; citizens will go down to the legislative body. That is where citizens are closest to their government, and those are the people to whom taxpayers can reach out and hold responsible--or wring their neck if necessary. 
   I believe that FERC should only regulate that which cannot be regulated by States because it is in interstate commerce. I repeat that: In my opinion, as represented in this bill, FERC should regulate only that which cannot be regulated by States because it is in interstate commerce. 
   I will highlight the important provisions of the legislation I have introduced today. One key element is the creation of a clear division of responsibility between the States and the Federal Government. States are responsible for retail matters affecting consumers in their State, including retail competition, and FERC is responsible for interstate matters, including wholesale competition. By creating this jurisdictional ``bright line,'' so to 
   speak, I think we will clear up the current confusion in the jurisdiction that has resulted in litigation which is slowing down progress on competition. In the future, if there is a problem, we will know whom to hold responsible. 
   Oftentimes in this business, accountability is pretty hard to find. We have designed this so we will be able to hold those responsible for their actions, and they will not be able to hide under a rock. 
   This legislation also includes provisions that will protect electric reliability which is so important to consumers in our economy. 
   I am pleased to say Senator LANDRIEU is joining me in this bipartisan legislation. The Senator from Louisiana has been very diligent in our Energy Committee. 
   The legislation protects electric reliability in two ways: First, it creates a comprehensive, reliability organization that has clear enforcement authority. This will help in the short term. Second, by promoting competition, it ensures reliability over the long run, because the market will respond to consumer needs. 
   The legislation also includes provisions to ensure that States and State public utility commissions will continue to be fully able to protect consumers. 
   The legislation has provisions which will provide access to all interstate transmission lines, not just those covered by investor-owned utilities. Removing gaps in transmission access will promote competition in the wholesale power market. 
   The legislation also addresses a number of other important issues including PURPA repeal, PUHCA repeal, assuring funding for nuclear power plant decommissioning, and authority to construct new transmission lines. 
   There are other important issues that need to be addressed during the legislative process. For example, we need to look at ways to streamline and speed up the merger review process. Utilities are rightfully distressed that FERC's process is far too cumbersome, takes far too long to complete, and as a consequence is far too expensive. And these costs are just passed on to consumers. FERC is retained to do their analysis and make their decisions in a timely manner. These drawn out decisions, for all practical purposes, are simply allowing full employment for far too many lawyers. 
   We also need to consider the creation of a universal service fund, similar to that which Congress included in the telecommunications legislation. This would help areas of the United States which do not yet have access to reliable and affordable electricity. Yes, there are regions in the United States where electricity is not taken for granted. My State of Alaska is one. 
   There is a related tax issue which must also be addressed in the context of comprehensive legislation. That is the tax-exempt municipal bond issue, creating a level competitive playing field between investor-owned utilities and municipally-owned utilities. 
   Because this is important to both municipally-owned and investor-owned utilities, I will talk about the problem for a moment. First, under the U.S. Tax Code, municipally-owned utilities can issue tax-exempt bonds to build new generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, but investor-owned utilities cannot issue tax-exempt bonds for these purposes. This gives municipally-owned utilities a taxpayer-provided competitive advantage to the extent they are able to use the facilities built with tax-exempt bonds to compete against private power which cannot use tax-exempt bonds. 
   On the flip side, under the Tax Code, municipal tax-exempt bonds are subject to a private-use limitation. This means that if municipal utilities go too far in competing against private utilities, if they exceed their ``private use'' limitation allowed by the IRS, their bonds are subject to retroactive taxation. This limits the ability of municipal utilities to compete in the market. I assume we will hear from them on that. There has to be some equity in this process. 
   The bottom line? We have a Tax Code that is not consistent with today's competitive environment. Both municipal utilities and private utilities are at risk. The issue must be addressed. It is not necessarily part of the legislation I am introducing today because the Tax Code issue is before the Finance Committee. I admit I am a member of that committee. Both the administration and Senator GORTON have legislative proposals pending before the Finance Committee.  
   But I call, finally, upon industry--private power and public power--to come and try to work out their differences on this and to bring Congress a compromise proposal that both sides can live with because it is something that simply has to be addressed. It is better to have the parties resolve it than have a dictate from the Congress. 
   There are other issues of regional consideration that will need to be addressed as part of comprehensive legislation. We need to resolve the role of the Federal power marketing administrations in the marketplace, including the Bonneville Power Administration. We also need to address the role of one of the largest utilities in the United States, the TVA. 
   I look forward to working with Senators from the Northwest--I see one on the floor--to address the Bonneville Power Administration issue, and the Senators from the South to address the Tennessee Valley Authority issue. I am convinced by promoting competition and protecting reliability this legislation will benefit the consumers, the economy, and our international competitors. 
   I, again, thank Senator LANDRIEU of Louisiana for cosponsoring this legislation. 
   To reiterate, I rise to introduce legislation to promote competition in the electric power industry. This legislation is bipartisan, it is cosponsored by Senator LANDRIEU. 
   Let me first say that competition is not the goal of this legislation. Instead, competition is the means to achieve the goal of assuring consumers reliable and reasonably-priced electricity. 
   We have seen great benefits from bringing competition to other industries such as natural gas, telecommunications, trucking and airlines. In each case, competition reduced prices, enhanced supply and encouraged innovation. There is every reason to expect that increased competition in the electric power industry will likewise benefit consumers. The Department of Energy agrees. It has projected consumer savings of $20 billion per year. 
   Great progress has already been made in both retail competition and wholesale competition. To date, retail competition programs have been adopted by 24 States, which cover 60 percent of U.S. consumers. All of the remaining States are now considering what kind of retail program would best meet their local needs. Competition has been brought to the interstate wholesale market through the enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and FERC's subsequent issuance of Orders No. 888 and 889. 
   So the legislative task facing Congress is to build on this progress, not to halt State progress on retail competition or to interfere with FERC progress on wholesale competition. 
   The question is: How do we get there from here? How do we move the electric power industry from regulation to competition? Should we preempt the States and substitute Federal regulation for State regulation, as some argue? Or should we instead deregulate to allow the market to operate? 
   To me the answer is obvious: Competition must be market-based, not government-run. We must stop having regulators pick winners and losers, making decisions that ought to be made by the marketplace. Substituting one regulator for another--Federal for State--is not deregulation. It's just different regulation. Creating a one-size-fits-all Federal solution may work in some States, but it will not work in all States. For the market to work and for consumers to enjoy the benefits of competition, we need to free the market from undue government interference. 
   I have long said that the best way to move toward market competition is to deregulate what we can, streamline what we cannot deregulate, and to facilitate States moving forward on retail competition. 
   While I would like to deregulate the entire electric power industry, I recognize that some regulation will remain necessary to protect consumers. Where regulation is necessary, I believe that it should be performed by the unit of government closest to the consumer. However, where the matter to be regulated is in interstate commerce, FERC must be the regulatory agency. Traditionally, States have regulated retail matters directly affecting consumers, and the FERC has regulated wholesale sales and transmission in interstate commerce. The legislation I am today introducing retains this traditional division of authority between the States and the FERC. 
   I will now outline the key provisions of the legislation. 
   One key element of this legislation is the creation of a clear division of authority between the States and the Federal 
   government. The legislation makes it clear that States are responsible for retail matters affecting consumers in their State, and the FERC is responsible for interstate matters. Thus, States will continue to be responsible for retail competition, and the FERC will continue to be responsible for wholesale competition. 
   This clarification is necessary because when the Federal Power Act was created in 1935, Congress did not foresee the current market and industry structure. As a result, there are now ambiguities as to the split in jurisdiction between the States and the Federal government. This has resulted in uncertainty and increasing litigation. Creating a jurisdictional ``bright line'' will help both States and the FERC move forward with their efforts to promote competition in their respective jurisdictions. Moreover, by creating clear lines of accountability, if things don't work right we will know exactly where to point the finger. 
   Another major aspect of this legislation is that it will protect the reliability of our electric power system. The legislation does so in two different ways. First it creates a grid-wide reliability organization that is given the enforcement authority necessary to assure reliability. The language in the legislation is the industry-supported North American Electric Reliability Council proposal, plus additional reliability provisions proposed by Western Governors, State public utility commissions and State energy officials. However, as much as this new organization will help ensure reliability, it is not the long-term solution. The real solution is to promote competition, and that can only be accomplished though comprehensive legislation such as this. 
   This legislation also includes provisions to provide access to all interstate transmission lines, not just those owned by investor-owned utilities. Under the Federal Power Act, Federally-owned utilities, State-owned utilities, municipally-owned utilities and cooperatively-owned utilities are all exempt from FERC's nondiscriminatory open access transmission program. These exempt utilities do not have to provide access to the transmission grid which adversely affects competition in the interstate wholesale power market. This legislation corrects that problem. 
   Another important aspect of this legislation is its confirmation that States are not prevented from protecting consumers on a variety of retail matters such as: distribution system reliability; safety; obligation to serve; universal service; assured service to low-income, rural and remote consumers; retail seller performance standards; and protection against unfair business practices. 
   There are similar provisions which confirm that States are not prevented from imposing a public interest charge to fund State programs such as: ensuring universal electric service, particularly for consumers located in rural and remote areas; environmental programs, renewable energy conservation programs; providing recovery of industry transition costs; providing transition costs for electricity workers hurt by restructuring; and research and development on electric technologies. 
   By including these provisions, my legislation will ensure that States and State public utility commissions are fully capable of protecting consumers and promoting the public 
   interest. 
   The legislation also contains a number of other important provisions including repeal of PURPA's mandatory purchase requirement, repeal of PUHCA and assuring funding for nuclear power plant decommissioning. 
   One provision in this legislation that I expect to be controversial is eminent domain authority to construct new interstate transmission lines. The provisions of the bill make this construction authority available in situations where there is a regional transmission planning process that provides for full  public input, and is reviewed and approved by the FERC; and the transmission project cannot otherwise be constructed either because the State does not have the necessary authority, or because the State has delayed action for more than one year; and the FERC, through a formal public process with all legal rights protected, finds that the new transmission line is in the public convenience and necessity. 
   When authorizing this construction, the legislation gives the FERC full authority to impose any requirements that are necessary to protect the public interest. 
   You might ask: Why include such a potentially controversial provision? There are three reasons. 
   The first reason is supply. We must have transmission lines if we are going to get electricity to consumers and industry. It is a simple fact of physics that you can't move electricity without power lines. 
   The second reason is market power. As you know, market power exists where there is more demand than an existing transmission line can handle--a bottleneck. There are two possible ways to address a bottleneck. The first is full regulation of the bottleneck transmission facility, with regulators picking the winners and losers. But that does not solve the problem, it just allocates the problem. The other is the free market approach. Let those who want to move their electric power to market build a new transmission line around the bottleneck--or at least have a credible threat to build if the owner of the bottleneck transmission line does not offer them a fair deal. 
   The third reason is reliability. Based on events over that past several years, it is clear that we need to enhance our transmission system if we are going to meet consumer needs during peak periods of demand. 
   For those who think eminent domain is a brand-new idea for energy facilities--it isn't. The Federal Power Act already gives Federal eminent domain for hydroelectric dams and their associated electric transmission lines. Similarly, the Natural Gas Act gives Federal eminent domain for interstate natural gas pipelines. If it works for interstate natural gas pipelines, it will work for interstate electric transmission lines. 
   Turning now to regional transmission organizations, the legislation I am today introducing retains the RTO provisions that were in my draft bill. While Order No. 2000 has many good aspects--its voluntary nature, flexibility, open architecture and transmission incentives--it does have some serious deficiencies. I am especially concerned about two key issues. 
   First, Order No. 2000 prohibits any active ownership of the RTO by a utility or market participant after a five year transition period. Oddly, this applies even to someone who only owns transmission. Clearly, this will discourage participation in RTOs by transmission owners. 
   Second, by denying transmission owners the ability to design and file complete transmission rates with FERC, Order No. 2000 creates confusion at best, and at worst it may deny transmission owners their rights under law to recover all of their prudently incurred costs. 
   If these and other deficiencies are not corrected, FERC Order No. 2000 may be litigated for years, creating great uncertainty in RTO formation. In light of the increasing concerns about grid reliability, delay in RTO formation would be particularly troublesome as Order No. 2000 makes RTOs directly responsible for short-term reliability. 
   Let me mention some significant matters that need to be addressed during the legislative process. 
   For example, there is the important issue of streamlining and speeding up the FERC merger review process. Utilities are rightfully distressed that FERC's process takes far too long and is much too cumbersome. 
   We also need to consider the creation of a universal service fund--similar to that which Congress included in the telecommunications legislation. This would help areas which do not have access to reliable and affordable electricity. And yes, there are regions of the United States where electricity is not taken for granted. 
   Another controversial issue that we must deal with in the context of comprehensive legislation is the tax-exempt municipal bond issue, creating a level competitive playing field between investor-owned utilities and municipally-owned utilities. Under the U.S. Code municipally-owned utilities can issue tax-exempt bonds to build new generation, transmission and distribution facilities, but investor-owned utilities cannot issue tax-exempt bonds for these purposes. This gives municipally-owned utilities a taxpayer-provided competitive advantage to the extent they are able to use facilities built with tax-exempt bonds to compete against private power--who cannot use tax-exempt bonds in the same way. But on the flip-side--under the tax code municipal tax-exempt bonds are subject to a ``private use'' limitation. This means that if municipal utilities go too far in competing against private utilities--if they exceed their ``private use'' limitation allowed by the IRS regulation--then their bonds are subject to retroactive taxation. This limits the ability of municipal utilities to compete in the market. The bottom line? We have a tax code that is not consistent with today's competitive environment, putting both municipal utilities and private utilities at risk. 
   Although this issue must be addressed, it is not a part of the legislation I am introducing because it is a tax code issue that is now before the finance committee. Both the Administration and Senator GORTON have legislative proposals pending before the finance committee. I call upon the industry--private power and public power--to work out their differences and to bring Congress a compromise proposal--that both sides can live with. 
   There are also a number of other regional issues that will need to be addressed as a part of comprehensive legislation. For example, we need to resolve the role of the Federal power marketing administrations in he marketplace--including the Bonneville Power Administration. We also need to address the role of one of the largest utilities in the United States--the Tennessee Valley Authority. 
   I am convinced that by promoting competition in the electric power industry and by addressing the reliability issue, this legislation will benefit consumers, our economy and our international competitiveness. Like the Secretary of Energy, I believe that it is now time to move forward with legislation. I hope that my colleagues agree.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to share with my colleagues the plight of our independent truckers who are here in Washington, many of them, expressing their frustration as a consequence of the high increase in the cost of diesel oil. These are individuals who own their own trucks, for the most part, and supply this country with untold tons of food and various other supplies, virtually everything we need. 
   This is a mobile society and we are dependent on energy to move us. The price of that energy has increased dramatically. 
   I have yet to hear from the administration expressing any of their concerns, as a consequence of this demonstration by the independent truckers who are trying to bring a focus to what kinds of relief the administration is proposing because every indication is we are going to see higher oil prices, higher energy prices. There are some reasons for this. One of them is we have an increased dependence on imports of oil. We are currently 55-percent dependent on import oil. Most of these imports are coming from the Mideast. 
   In the world of the oil market, the United States is certainly a giant consumer but, a bit player. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries really calls the tune, and the U.S. generally has to pay the piper. That organization is known by all of us as OPEC. There are 11 countries that make up OPEC, and they produce more than 40 percent of the world's oil and possess three-fourths of the world's proven reserves. The United States, as I indicated, imports 55 percent of the oil we use, or about 10.5 million barrels out of the 19.3 million barrels of oil consumed in the Nation in each and every day. 
   The point I want to make is this is not just a one-time incident. If you go back to 1973, some of you will remember the lines around the block at the gas station. At that time, we had an Arab oil embargo. However, at that time, we were 36-percent dependent on imported oil, and we created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We said we would never expose ourselves to near 50-percent dependence on foreign oil. Today, we are 55-percent dependent, as I have indicated, and growing. It is our own Government's policies, or lack of policies, both local and national, that have handicapped our domestic industry. The result is consumers from New York to Oregon are paying the price. The truckers who are in Washington today, are paying the price, but not without some loud howls, seeking some Government relief. Several of these self-imposed handicaps are correctable if we would only wake up to a few realities. 
   On the production side, we have banned oil exploration off a good portion of our coastline, including California and Florida, because a majority of these States oppose it. They have every right to oppose it, and we should honor it. However, we refuse to consider exploration in many areas where clearly it is supported, such as in some areas of Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, and my State of Alaska. 
   We should, in these areas where the public supports exploration, get an aggressive leasing plan and proceed to open up these areas, using the advanced technology we have and getting on with the task of lessening our dependence on imported oil. 
   The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in my State of Alaska has often been mentioned as a potential for major oil discovery. From the standpoint of my State of Alaska, we have supplied this country with nearly 20 percent of the total crude oil produced in the last 27 years. We have done it through a pipeline and a development process that has been safe. The tragic accident of the Exxon Valdez was a tanker accident that had nothing to do with the production or transportation of oil by pipeline. 
   The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge consists of 19 million acres. The assumption is that the entire 19 million acres is going to be open for exploration. That is not correct. Congress has set aside 8 million acres of that tract in wilderness in perpetuity that can never be disturbed. Another 9.5 million acres have been 
   set aside in a wildlife refuge. No development is allowed or is going to be allowed. The remainder of that 19 million acres is 1.5 million acres which geologists have identified as holding as much as 16 billion barrels of oil which would or could replace Saudi oil coming into the United States for the next 30 years. It is not a drop in the bucket by any means. 
   Where is this administration going with regard to lessening our dependence on imported oil? It wants to raise taxes on the oil companies, saying the royalty valuation in the past has been unfair. Is that an incentive for exploration? I think not. 
   The President's current proposal in his budget calls for more than $400 million in new taxes on the oil industry. Who is going to pay those taxes? It is going to be the American consumer. 
   The consequences are evident. Since the Clinton administration assumed office, U.S. crude oil production has fallen by 17 percent, and during that period U.S. consumption of oil has gone up 14 percent. Why? Some people drive bigger cars than they used to. Some people like air-conditioning. Some people get on that jet airplane. 
   What has happened to the industry? Our drilling rigs have gone from 532 active rigs operating in 1990 to 133 rigs operating in 2000. 
   What is our policy? Our policy is to become more dependent on imports. 
   On the downstream side, domestic policy really is not any better. Some of my New York colleagues have concerned themselves about the high price of heating oil. I am sympathetic with those who are dependent on that energy source, but while I sympathize on the one hand, I also point out that a good portion of this is self-inflicted. Prices are high because stocks are low. 
   The State of New York itself reports that the petroleum bulk storage capacity has declined over the past 5 years by more than 15 percent, and the heating oil storage capacity has declined nearly 20 percent, largely due to environmental regulations. Those regulations may be well-founded, but the fact is they do not have either the storage for crude nor the storage they once had for heating oil. Of course, it has been a cold winter. When the heating oil supply is tight, many of my colleagues search for an excuse, while the answer is right in their backyard. 
   Moving over to suggested relief that has been proposed by opening up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is our petroleum reserve in case of a national emergency, there is a suggestion that if we were to release that, somehow this would address the concerns we have over the high price of heating oil. Let me walk you through that scenario. 
   First of all, the SPR is for supply disruption emergencies. It is a crude oil supply in salt caverns in Louisiana. As a consequence, it has a limited capacity to get out that crude. 
   It is not heating oil. It is crude. So it has to be moved from SPR to refineries, be refined, and then go into the market. 
   The difficulty with this is the refineries have crude supplies. So if you bring in SPR crude, you are going to have to offset that with the crude they have at the refinery already. The difficulty is in the mix of what the refineries make. As a consequence of low stocks going into this winter, based on the assumption this would not be a cold winter, those inventories were low. Coupled with the reduction in the storage supply for the fuel oil--and then later we did have a colder winter; we all saw the Coast Guard breaking ice in the Hudson River--as a consequence of that, we could not meet the demand for heating oil, and the price went up to nearly $2 a gallon. That was indeed unfortunate. 
   Relief. The refiners continued to produce more heating oil. The weather  began to cooperate, and reports suggested that Europe sent over refined product. 
   The point I want to make is, SPR is not the answer because the simple reality is, you do not displace one type of crude oil with another. That does not relieve the problem. It is the mix within the refineries. 
   Now we have an administration that is petitioning them to still produce large volumes of heating oil even though there are indications the inventories are now adequate. The real threat is that they should be producing gasoline soon for the summer market. We could see a shortage of gasoline this summer and perhaps retail price increases in the neighborhood of nearly $2 a gallon. 
   We did a little comparison on the west coast, which is the area where I am from. We did a comparison for retail prices in three Western States and Alaska. We found California's regular gasoline was $1.38 per gallon; for Oregon's regular gasoline, it was $1.42 per gallon; for Washington's regular gasoline, it was $1.35 per gallon; and for my State of Alaska, it was $1.35 per gallon. 
   But when we talk about self-inflicted problems, we need to look at the taxes imposed on each gallon of gas within the four States. 
   California's tax burden is about 46.4 cents on the gallon; for Oregon, it is 45.4 cents per gallon; for Washington State, it is about the same. The taxes include Federal, State, and local taxes in the three States. California includes a sales tax, as well, and has the added burden of 5 to 8 cents a gallon its residents must pay for reformulated gasoline. 
   Oregon is a little different. It adds to its cost by banning self-service as an option at the pumps. In other words, you do not fill up your car in Oregon. Somebody does it for you. You pay for it. The estimated additional cost is about 15 cents a gallon. 
   But in Alaska, my State, the combined taxes are only 26 cents. Without taxes, my State of Alaska actually pays the highest price for gasoline of the four States; yet we produce it all--or a good portion of it. 
   Gasoline prices. If you take off gas taxes, take off the cost of additives, take off the cost in relation to whether or not somebody fills your tank, then you begin to be able to identify what the true costs are to the consumer for a gallon of gasoline. 
   My State of Alaska supplies 46 percent of the current stock to the west coast. But barrels of oil from Alaska are beginning to decline. We are producing little more than a million barrels a day. Virtually all of that is shipped to Washington and California; significant portions go from Washington to Oregon. 
   California's Senators object to any development in the Arctic. But without new development, the production will continue to decline, and it will be necessary for the west coast and their west coast constituents to purchase more oil from even more expensive sources, such as the Mideast. How are they going to get the oil in? In foreign tankers owned by foreign companies that clearly have more of an environmental exposure than our own domestic fleet. 
   Common sense tells us we should stop handicapping our industry. We should do this by encouraging exploration, development of our reserves, and not increasing taxes on this industry. 
   Oil development in my State can be done right. It is environmentally sound. It keeps land disturbance to a minimum. 
   To give you some idea, out of the 19 million acres of ANWR that we talked about, of the million and a half acres that Congress has the authority to open up--and I add, this body voted to open it up; and the President vetoed it a number of years ago--the footprint is estimated to be no larger than the footprint of the Dulles International Airport, assuming the rest of Virginia were wilderness. That is to give you some idea of the magnitude of what the footprint is. It is relatively small. 
   Again, I remind you that the estimates are that the ANWR area could produce more than 16 billion barrels of oil, which would equate to about what we bring in from Saudi Arabia over a 30-year period. Yet this administration would rather bolster the oil output of Saddam Hussein by lifting oil production limits in Iraq, which is what they have done. Should we really be placing our energy security on OPEC decisions? 
   The administration pursues policies that discourage investment within our borders, driving investment overseas, and our jobs overseas. If we are going to participate in this energy race, we are going to need to get in the game. If we choose to continue to drive oil production offshore, then we will have no room--or little room--to complain about the high price of that decision, or the insecurity of our future oil supplies. 
   There is no question in my mind that our national energy security is very much at risk. We still do not seem to get it. We do not understand the vulnerability of increasing our dependence on imports. 
   If we look over our shoulders at world crude markets, since 1997, we have gone from a low of $10 a barrel to $30 a barrel. To some extent, we have explained that this was due to the slowdown of the Asian economy, mild winters, and increased Saudi and Venezuela production. Then we have also seen OPEC kind of get its act together with self-discipline. It cut production 6 percent. They decided they would rather sell less oil but sell it higher than sell more oil and sell it lower. 
   Then we saw the Asian economy rebound. Winters in the U.S. got colder even with global warming. The thought from OPEC was: Wait a minute. We are going to hold off for a little while. We saw the low stocks as a result of this. 
   Of course, we have discussed the heating oil situation and SPR and OPEC and ANWR. But when we get back to what the administration is doing about it, we are still stuck with the reality that they are throwing more taxes at us--$400 million. They are not encouraging the industry to go out and drill, as evidenced by the reduction in drilling rigs. 
   Some of them say: We will simply go out and hook up to natural gas. The National Petroleum Council report indicated that is not going to be a viable alternative. They said that we consume about 20 trillion cubic feet of gas today. We will be consuming about 31 trillion cubic feet in the next 10 years. We do not have the infrastructure in to meet that demand. It is going to have to be an expenditure of about $1.5 trillion. Gas will not be cheap. 
   The Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Babbitt, won't make public lands available to produce natural gas. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission puts up environmental roadblocks to building new gas pipelines to the Northeast. Where is the power going to come from? 
   Some would say hydroelectric. We have already seen the proposal by the Secretary of the Interior. He wants to tear down four dams in the Pacific Northwest. Now a FERC Commissioner, Commissioner Hoecker, claims that FERC has the authority to tear these dams down. 
   Moving over to coal, the administration is proposing to take a number of plants down through EPA decisions. Those were plants that were grandfathered in under the Clean Air Act, with the assumption that they would operate for a period of time. As the power industry has attempted to maintain those plants, they have been subjected to criminal prosecution by the EPA for extending the life of the plants. I am not debating the issue of, if you stay within your permit by continuing to maintain your plant at a level that you have to, whether you are extending the life of that plant or not. But that is the dilemma for the coal industry. 
   We have already debated for days the reality and role of the nuclear industry, the fact that it contributes 20 percent of the power in this country. The administration does not want to address a solution on its watch. It would just as soon let the industry choke on its own waste. While we had 64 votes the other day, we were still a few short of a veto override, and the President threatened to veto the legislation that would address, temporarily, relief so our nuclear industry could continue to produce power. 
   With the attitude of the administration, it is evident that in the area of nuclear, coal, hydroelectric, there are simply no alternatives being proposed. I suggest to the Senate that is an irresponsible attitude. It seems all this administration wants to do is to hang on until it is over--and I can't wait--in  the hope that there won't be some kind of calamity that will disrupt their departure. I suggest there is going to be a calamity. It relates to what is happening in Washington today with the truckers. This is proof the folks out there are fed up. They are looking to Government for a response. They are fed up with the administration's attitude which suggests we should go over to OPEC and beg that they increase production, that we become more dependent on imported oil. The realities of that are totally unacceptable to this Senator. 
   It is going to get more serious. OPEC would like to see oil at somewhere between $20 and $25; that is good for OPEC. I suppose now that it is $30, it might be good for the United States. 
   OPEC is having a meeting in March, but some economists suggest it is too late. We are going to be increasingly exposed to increased gasoline prices this summer. Some suggest we are going to be subjected to $40 oil, if Saddam Hussein chooses to cut off his supply in protest of United Nations sanctions. Here we are in the United States, dependent on what Saddam Hussein might do to his oil production that could affect our price of energy. Incredible, Mr. President, incredible, but nevertheless true. 
   As I have indicated, the past year alone, oil has tripled in cost to $30 from less than $11; heating oil, nearly $2 a gallon; our airline tickets, $20 surcharge. One of these days when you go to fill up that sports utility vehicle, it is going to cost you $60 to fill your gas tank. 
   People in this technological age wonder what the role of oil is. Is oil energy king? Well, let's look at inflation. We hear Chairman Greenspan worry about inflation, about oil prices increasing. The Secretary of Energy, in the meantime, tours six oil-producing nations. He says he can't ignore the potential for oil to have an impact on inflation. He says what OPEC does matters, and it sure does. I think we are at a point of reckoning where oil has reemerged as a political and economic threat to our 
   economy. 
   Now, here we are, looking at dependence on Mideast oil-producing countries, and we are asking them to change their cash-flow to accommodate us and increase production. I wonder if they will be inclined to do that. 
   If we look at some of the realities associated with inflation, I think we have to look over our shoulder and recognize what happened in the past. Many people don't remember the gas lines in 1973. December of 1980, inflation in this country was 11 percent; the prime rate was 20.5 percent. People started to wake up. Are they waking up now? The signs are there. Is OPEC willing to sacrifice windfall oil profits to help keep economic growth on track in the United States, Europe, and Asia at their own expense? I happen to believe that charity begins at home. We have become dependent on OPEC. Can we be dependent on them increasing the supply of oil? 
   A source of information from the International Energy Agency says that OPEC will have to increase by 10 percent just to keep up with world demands. If they don't want to keep up with world demands, the price goes up, doesn't it? That will increase production somewhere between 4.5 and 12 percent, or between 1.2 and 3.1 million barrels per day. 
   A lot of people don't realize how long it takes for a barrel of oil from the Mideast to reach their gas station. It is roughly 6 weeks. If we go into this summer with the current forecast we are getting, we will see gasoline at $2 a gallon. We depend on oil to keep us warm, for travel, for our homes, sport utility vehicles, on and on, and we are concerned about prosperity. We are concerned about inflation. 
   There was an article by Daniel Yergin with the Cambridge Energy Research Association, an expert on oil. He indicated there are three things that can get people concerned about inflation and spook the stock market. When I highlight them, you will agree they are here. 
   It is the price and availability of labor. It is the cost of money or interest rates that are on the rise. And it is the increased price of oil. 
   We are starting to move. Mark my words, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development has estimated that every $10 rise in the price of oil lifts inflation by 1/2 percentage point and reduces economic growth by 1/4 percent. If that isn't what is happening right now, I will trade places with the President of this body. Oil prices have accounted for the doubling of inflation, to 2 percent from 1.1 percent in the last year. 
   I quote Chairman Greenspan:  
   I've been through too many oil shocks to not take them seriously. If price changes, it impacts the economy.  
   These are a few of the highlights of where the United States is, why the truckers are circulating in Washington, DC. 
   What is this administration doing about it? They are kowtowing to the Arab world. They are wringing their hands. They have no positive suggestions. Least of all, they have not made one single statement to encourage domestic exploration and production in this country. One wonders what you learn by history; some people say ``not much.'' If you look over your shoulder at where we were in the early 1970s with the Arab oil embargo, where we are today--and, of course, in the interim we fought a war over oil in Iraq and Kuwait. Today, we are right back there, only we are more dependent on the Mideast. If we don't take the steps now to reduce that dependence, this is going to happen again. 
   Keep in mind that, for the time being, it isn't over. We are just starting into this crisis. This administration must be held accountable for the lack of an energy policy in this country. There is no energy policy on nuclear power, no energy policy on coal, no energy policy on gas, no energy policy on oil. It kind of drifts out there. And they are well-meaning, but some extreme environmental groups basically propel the direction of this administration. It is no direction at all because there is no energy policy. 
   So as we look at the increased price of energy, we look at the frustration of the truckers in Washington, DC, and we look at what the administration is doing to address it, we have to come to the conclusion that the administration's efforts--if you can identify them at all--are limited to pleading with the Mideast oil barons to simply produce more oil. That is inadequate. They are simply exporting jobs and dollars. We are going to have to turn this around in the Congress of the United States. The administration won't stand up and recognize the reality that charity begins at home. We have the resources in this country, we have the technology, we have the capital, and we can relieve our dependence on imports if given the support of the Clinton administration.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I note a Dear Colleague letter is circulating this morning from one of our colleagues from Montana and one of our colleagues from California. It concerns the critical environmental vote that will occur at 11 o'clock on the Nuclear Waste Policy Act amendments. 
   It identifies that the protection of the health and safety of American citizens should be our highest priority. I agree with that. It further states that in order to do this, all decisions must be made based on science, not politics. It suggests this legislation does not do that. 
   I implore my colleagues, what we are attempting to do is use the best science available. That is why we brought the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the National Science Academy into the recommending process for EPA. But I point out for the benefit of anyone who still has a doubt that the Environmental Protection Agency has the final authority on determining the radiation standards. But the effort is to get the best science. 
   Let's be honest with one another. Every time this legislation comes up, it comes down to one thing: Nobody wants the waste. 
   I have said time and again, if you throw it up in the air, it has to come down somewhere and that somewhere is Nevada. That decision was made some time ago. We have expended $6 billion in the Yucca Mountain effort. 
   The criticism of this legislation to which this Dear Colleague letter points is it doesn't address an alternative. It is innuendo to say the legislation ``unnecessarily slows EPA's ability.'' It can't do anything until it is licensed. The ``legislation conveys undisclosed acreage of Federal land to Nye and Lincoln Counties in Nevada without providing any maps of the areas or conducting any hearings.'' That is simply not true. 
   We are trying to accommodate the two affected counties in Nevada by giving them BLM-accessed land. What in the world is wrong with that? Is that contrary to the public health and safety? To me it is good for the people of Nevada. I am sure if you asked the two Senators from Nevada whether their constituents should receive this land, they would have a pretty positive opinion. 
   What we have here are more smokescreens. We have a statement by the minority ranking member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works saying they have the sole discretion over nonmilitary environmental regulations and control of atomic energy. Well, as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, we have the obligation to address the disposal of the nuclear waste. We have attempted to do that in a responsible manner. 
   Yes, this is politics. This is hard core politics. It is trying to accommodate my good friends from Nevada over their objection to put the waste in their State. The Clinton administration, the administration of Vice President Gore, simply doesn't want to address it on their watch. That is all there is to it. 
   Each Member who votes against this legislation better be prepared to go home and explain why they voted to keep the waste in their individual State, when we had a chance to move it out to one central location at Yucca Mountain. There it is, 80 sites in 40 States. We have a chance to move it to one location. 
   The Northeast corridor State Governors said: We don't trust the Federal Government; they didn't take the waste in 1998 when it was contractually due; the ratepayers paid $15 billion; they broke the sanctity of a contractual relationship. What the Governors are saying is they don't want the waste stored in their State by the Federal Government taking title because they are convinced the Federal Government will leave it there. Well, they very well could be right. 
   As a consequence, we have this waste stored in these States on the way to the schoolgrounds, the playgrounds, the hospitals, homes. We have it on the shores of the Great Lakes--Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, Lake Erie, Lake Superior, Lake Ontario--the great rivers--the Mississippi, the Colorado, the Columbia--the Nation's seashores. We must resolve to put it at a permanent site. That is all there is to it. 
   We have a good bill. This is a responsible environmental vote. The environmental community has said, we are opposed to this legislation. What are they for? Are they for leaving the waste where it is? Well, they wouldn't respond to that question. 
   Each Member of this body is elected to make a responsible decision and not be led by groups motivated by their own 
   particular ideology. Make no mistake about it: A large segment of America's environmental community wants to kill the nuclear power industry. They want to kill the nuclear industry because they are opposed to it. But they don't look at the contribution that industry makes to clean air, and they do not address the responsibility of what the alternative is. 
   So a responsible environmental vote is to move this from these 40 States and 80 sites to one central location that is designed for it. Make no mistake about it: These temporary locations are not designed for it. 
   There is criticism that this is some kind of a full blown attack by the nuclear power industry. What they are seeking is relief. They are seeking relief from the waste that has been generated over an extended period of time and the inability of the Federal Government to meet its contractual commitments. That should make every Member of this body indignant. But that is what happened. Do you know who is taking it in the shorts? The American taxpayer, because the claims against the Federal Government for not taking that waste under the contract are somewhere between $40 and $80 billion. That is about $1,400 per family every year in this country. Nobody seems to care about it. I care about it. I am sure you do, Mr. President. 
   We have a good bill. It uses the WIPP transportation model. It is safe transport. The States decide the routes. Some of my colleagues are fearful it is going to be moved by rail. It is not going to be moved by rail. It is very doubtful. Rails don't go direct. A rail goes from one railyard to the next railyard. Oftentimes those railyards are around areas of high concentration of population. That doesn't make sense. The Governors are going to have control of where these routes are determined. They are going to be safe routes because we are going to have professionals out there determining the safeguards, the drivers, and so forth. In fact, we submitted a letter yesterday from the national Teamsters Union. They are concerned because they want trained people. Their trained people will be involved.  
   Finally, EPA has the sole authority to set the radiation standard. Don't let anybody tell you differently. I love my friends from Nevada. I really do. I have a great deal of respect for them. I know where they are coming from. Do you know what they said in the hearing? They said, regardless of what the safeguards are, what assurances we have, we are not going to support a bill that would put the waste in Nevada. I understand that. So it means it doesn't make any difference what we do, what the minority does, what the Senator from California and the Senator from Montana do. We will never be able to convince them. I understand that. So let's recognize that for what it is. 
   The Secretary may settle lawsuits and save the taxpayers this $80 billion liability. This legislation allows early receipt of fuel, once construction is authorized, as early as 2006. The nuclear waste fee can only be increased by Congress. It prevents unreasonable increases in the fees. We provide benefits to counties most affected by repository land conveyance of the 76,000 acres to Nye and Lincoln Counties. This is the land that Nevada wanted. Well, I wonder how bad they want it now. 
   We struggled with this problem for many years. The time is right. S. 1287 is the solution. Utility consumers have paid over $15 billion into that waste fund. We cannot jeopardize the health and safety of citizens across the country by leaving that spent nuclear fuel in 80 sites in 40 States. That is irresponsible. We should move it once and for all where it belongs: at a remote site on the desert. 
   I will show my colleagues that picture one more time, where we have had 800 nuclear tests over a period of 50 years. That is the site. We risk, if we can't get this legislation through, losing 20 percent of our clean generation. Where are we going to make it up? We can't jeopardize our economic and environmental future by ignoring the nuclear waste management issues. That is what we are going to do if this legislation is not supported. We risk losing 103 nuclear powerplants. 
   I urge Members to vote for S. 1287 and finally put this problem behind us. 
   And one more time, Mr. President--remember, each Member who votes against this bill is going to be obliged to explain why they voted to keep the waste in one of the 40 States that they come from when they had a chance to move it to one central location, Yucca Mountain.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as this debate comes to an end, I think it appropriate to respond to my friend from New Mexico relative to what I understand he said--that he had not seen a real letter from the Governors opposing taking title. I don't know whether the White House will not make that available, but we have it here. I will be happy to share it with him. I will put it in the RECORD because it shows all the signatures of all the Governors: 
   The Honorable Howard Dean, Governor of Vermont; the Honorable Jeb Bush, Governor of Florida; the Honorable Angus King, Jr., Governor of Maine; the Honorable John Kitzhaber, Governor of Oregon; the Honorable Jeanne Shaheen, Governor of New Hampshire; the Honorable Jesse Ventura, Governor of Minnesota; and the Honorable Tom Vilsack, Governor of Iowa. 
   There are more coming, I am told. I hope we can put that particular criticism to rest. 
   This is not an imaginary letter. This a letter from the Governors objecting, if you will, to the situation of leaving the waste in their States for the specific reason that they don't trust the Federal Government. The reason they do not trust the Federal Government is the Federal Government has not performed on its contract after taking $15 billion from the ratepayers to take the waste. They are fearful that the waste will stay in their States under the control of the Federal Government. That is a legitimate concern. 
   Again, I refer to the chart of where that waste is. It is in those 40 States. It is in 40 States, and each Member is going to have to respond as to why they voted to leave that waste in their State. 
   We have had questions brought up about the land in Nevada. It is kind of fuzzy because this is beneficial to Nevada. Now they are saying they did not have any notice and they don't have the maps. The maps are in our office. We have them for the counties. I am sure the minority could get them. I am sure the two Senators from Nevada could get the maps of their own counties. We have them in our office, in fact, and I will try to get them in the RECORD so they can see them. 
   As far as the land transfer is concerned, it has always been in previous bills. These are smokescreens. Our friends from Nevada are trying to explain why this isn't a good deal. They wanted it. It is there. Now they are saying: Well, just wait a minute; we don't have the facts. We have them. They are there and available for anybody. The land transfer is authorized in the previous bills. Let's not beat around the bush. 
   In the remaining time I have, I want to highlight what this bill really accomplishes. 
   I think the minority ranking member would recognize that we have tried to work with him on his list of alternatives. We addressed his concern on the interim storage. Our bill uses the WIPP transportation model. EPA has the sole authority to set the standard. We took out the international collaboration in transmutation which they wanted. We couldn't take everything, but we certainly tried. 
   This is a valuable piece of legislation as it stands because we have in this substitute dropped the interim storage. Isn't this kind of ironic? We dropped the interim storage. The administration was opposed to the interim storage in Nevada. The idea was that we could move this stuff out at a critical time and put it out there. They said: No, we can't do that 
   until Yucca is finalized--until it is finally licensed. But now they are doing it twice. They are having it both ways. They are saying we will just leave it in the State. Then it becomes interim in the State. These Governors are smart enough to figure it out. I hope every Member of this body is because it is a flimflam. That is just what it is. 
   The administration wants to have it both ways. They do not want interim storage. They want the interim storage in the States. It drops interim storage. 
   It requires Congress to approve any increase in fees to protect the consumer. It sets schedules for development of a repository. It authorizes backup storage at the repository for any spent fuel that the utilities can't store on site. It allows the EPA to set radiation standards after June 1, 2001; prior to that consultation only with NAS and NRC, to ensure that any standard is the best science available. 
   What in the world is wrong with that? 
   It authorizes settlement agreements for outstanding litigation. It requires an election to settle within 180 days as requested by the administration. In other words, it brings them together. 
   Finally, it transfers 76,000 acres. 
   Let me conclude by saying that each Member is going to have to respond as to why they left this waste in their State if they don't support this bill. I encourage my colleagues to recognize that it is time to bring this matter to an end. Let's support the legislation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I certainly want to accommodate the Senator from Massachusetts. I would like to take a moment to thank some of the people who have worked on this legislation. 
   I take this opportunity to, first of all, compliment the professional staff who prepared a good deal of the material for the debate we just concluded. Andrew Lundquist, who is pretty much the general on the Energy Committee as the chief of staff of the Energy Committee, worked very hard. He had a little difficulty because his wife had a baby in the middle of the debate--a little girl, who joins three young brothers. But I do thank Andrew. 
   Colleen Deegan, who is on my right, we would not have been able to get as far as we had without her. Other committee staff who helped or others who did not create too many problems are Kelly Johnson, Kristin Phillips, Bryan Hannigan, David Dye, Betty Nevitt, Jim Beirne--who sat here an extended period of time--and Bob Simon and Sam Fowler from the minority. The departed staff member who worked on this for about 5 years is Karen Hunsicker, who worked on it until the end of last year. 
   While Senator BINGAMAN and I could not agree to resolve all the issues, I compliment him and his staff for working to try to reach an accord on the issue. 
   I think it is unfortunate we could not bring the administration aboard in a responsible manner, either taking title or without taking title. It is clear this matter will not be resolved on the watch of the Clinton administration. I suspect the Vice President's attitude on this should be known by the public as the campaign progresses. 
   But nevertheless, I thank my two colleagues from Nevada for the manner in which they nobly represented the interests of their State. That is very important around here. As they know, Senator STEVENS and I have often tried to convince this body that those of us who are elected from an individual State really have the best interests of that State at heart. For the most part, the Members I think should be very sensitive of that fact. That was evidenced in the vote today. 
   I would like to make one assumption, that where we ended up is where we ended up the last time on this. Although Senator MCCAIN was not here, we can assume he would have voted with us.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Of course, Senator KENNEDY was not here. 
   While there were a few changes, we ended up just about where we were the last time. As far as I am concerned, this matter has to rest with the administration for a solution. The Senator from Alaska will not be banging his head against the door to try to solve this Nation's nuclear waste problem until we get from the administration a program that suggests they are going to address the problem with a resolve. 
   Again, I thank all of those who were involved in the debate. I wish you all a good day as we lament on the reality of this last vote. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me thank my good friend from New Mexico, the chairman of the Budget Committee. We had a chart that we used in the debate. That chart showed the 40 States that had the accumulated waste--80 sites in 40 States. I wish I would have added the 85 nuclear ships that are traversing the ocean because the Senator from New Mexico is quite correct. That is something we don't talk much about. It works. The Navy, obviously, has the expertise that has been developed over a long period of time. When those submarines or surface ships are taken out of active duty, reactors are removed. That waste is taken and stored at various areas in the country. Chicken Little was suggested around here today; the world is coming down. It doesn't have to come down. It is the emotional arguments that prevail without any sound science. 
   I appreciate the input of my good friend and his commitment to the obligation that remains unresolved.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to address very briefly a couple of issues. One is the issue of the high cost of heating oil, particularly in the Northeast corridor at this time. I know my colleagues from the Northeast are looking for relief. Perhaps I could enlighten them to some extent on the reasons behind why prices are high and why stocks are low. 
   I think it is important to recognize a couple of basic facts that underline the whole question; that is, understanding the crude oil and heating oil relationship. 
   There are some who suggest we have a shortage of crude. That is the reason we have higher prices for heating oil. Factually, however there is no refinery in this country that has been short of a supply of crude oil during this crisis. The problem is the refineries have been cutting a different mix of product. They cut heating oil. They cut gasoline. They cut diesel fuel as well as other hydrocarbons. They have begun to cut other mixes instead of heating oil. So if they change the mix and reduce gasoline for heating oil, that could give some relief, but it may ultimately result in a shortage of gasoline during peak usage in the coming months. 
   The basic difficulty is coupled with the fact that the inventories were low. That is perhaps the fault of the industry. But while the inventories were low, the crucial problem is the storage areas for these stocks were reduced dramatically. 
   What do I mean by that? I mean the tanks around the metropolitan areas that are conventionally used to store the heating oils, the gasolines, and so forth. 
   In the case of New York, petroleum bulk storage capacity has declined 15 percent over the past 5 years. Why? According to testimony the other day from New York State officials on heating oils, this is a consequence of tighter environmental controls that suggest these old storage areas are inadequate or a danger to the environment. That may well be the case. However, the reality is we reduced our storage and as a consequence we don't have the inventory of heating oils that we would have had if we had the storage available. 
   I am not suggesting that people from New York or anywhere else don't need strong environmental regulations. They do. But we have to understand how we got into this predicament. That is the reason why the inventories are down. 
   Some say the answer is to open up SPR, a strategic petroleum reserve in Louisiana. We need to recognize we don't have a shortage of crude oil at the refineries, and if we further understand that in SPR there is no heating oil--it is not refined oil, it is crude oil; therefore, by taking oil out of SPR and take it to the refinery, we will displace what the refinery is already refining to accommodate SPR. So we don't have any net gain. 
   Most people cannot quite understand that. They think SPR is for heating oil that can be taken out of SPR and distributed, thereby easing the shortage. We cannot do that. 
   I understand the Secretary of Energy will make an announcement today or very shortly about the administration's efforts regarding high oil prices. Let's look at this because it is important. They will do something more for the Low-Income Housing Energy Assistance Program, which provides money for the low-income areas. That is commendable. However, that does not solve the underlying problem. They will ``jawbone'' more with the OPEC countries to release more oil. They can release more oil, but will they reduce the price? That is crude oil that had to be refined. They will encourage refiners to make more heating fuels--they might be able to persuade them to do that but it will change the mix and might result in a gasoline shortage this summer. 
   The interesting thing about the administration's response is, nowhere is there a commitment that we increase our domestic petroleum production to make us less dependent on OPEC pricing policies. That would be contrary to the environmental community who objects to the production domestically of oil and gas. Let me go a step forward. The Vice President said: If I'm elected I will cancel all the OCS leases, oil and gas. 
   What does he propose we will do? We cannot address what we will do with our nuclear waste. As far as I'm concerned the administration can choke on that waste. That seems to be their only solution. 
   We have an administration that proposes more new taxes on our domestic oil and gas industry. Think about that. We have a heating oil crisis, we have high prices, there are barges in transit and ships coming over from Europe with heating oil. That may help. We cannot move the crude oil out of SPR fast enough. We cannot get it to refineries that have any unused capacity. And we don't have adequate storage to store the reserves. 
   If you want to debate that issue, as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee I will try to work with Members. But let's be realistic and try to understand what the problem is and not fool the public. 
   If anyone saw the Coast Guard cutter grinding through the ice on the Hudson  River to try and clear the waterways for the heating supplies to be delivered, they would have a better understanding and appreciation of some of the real problems. 
   I want to work with my colleagues to try and address this but 
   let's make sure we understand the realities associated with that. I have a problem with our continued dependence on jawboning the Middle East countries. Our friend Saddam Hussein is now producing nearly 2 million barrels a day. The consequences of that, in view of the fact we fought a war not so long ago, suggests that our energy policies are inconsistent, to say the least. 
   We talked about the administration's ``cure'' to encourage more production. The President has proposed $50 million in new and expanded user fees over 5 years on our domestic oil companies drilling in offshore waters. Is that going to continue to drive production in the United States? It will continue to drive it overseas and increase our reliance on imported oil from foreign shores--and we are 56 percent dependent now. The user fees are included in the administration's fiscal year 2001 budget. According to reports, the fees would raise $10 million in each of the next 5 years by increasing rental rates on oil leases, among other fees. 
   In addition, we understand the budget recommends reinstating the oil spill liability trust fund to add 5 cents a barrel excise on both domestic and imported oil. This equals $350 million per year from all sources. 
   Once again, instead of encouraging our domestic oil industry, this administration seeks to discourage it wherever possible. The result is that we are 56 percent dependent on foreign oil; and the Mideast, where that oil comes from, where there is a huge abundance of oil, is sitting back nodding their head and smiling as they continue to control the discipline within their cartel not to allow overproduction and a decline in price. 
   The national energy security of this Nation is at risk as we become more and more dependent on imported oil. We have tremendous domestic reserves in this country if we can only open them. My State of Alaska has produced 20 percent of the crude oil produced in the United States for the last 20 years. If allowed on land in Alaska to use the technology that we have, we can continue not only to produce 20 percent but probably increase that to 30 percent or maybe 40 percent. The alternative is to increase our dependence on imported oil. 
   Senator LANDRIEU and I have a bill, Senate bill 25, that will try and address a fair return to the coastal impact areas offshore and onshore relative to a reasonable revenue stream that ought to come back to these areas as a consequence of oil and gas development on the outer continental shelf. This is legislation that all coastal States would share in, whether they have any oil and gas activities. This legislation would benefit the environment but it would put control of how that money is spent--not with a central Federal Government dictate, but with the participation of the States and the local communities. That is the way it has to be.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as a former banker, I must draw attention to what I consider an extraordinary movement by this administration, the Department of Treasury's decision to distribute the U.S. $1 coin to America's largest retailer, Wal-Mart, in Arkansas. 
   Isn't that extraordinary? The banks have always been the agency for distributing new money and the agency for bringing in mutilated money. But for the first time the Department of Treasury has gone to a retailer, Wal-Mart, headquartered in President Clinton's home State, I might add, and I am told that as a promotion they have cut a deal with General Mills, where there are a few of them in boxes of Cheerios. 
   The banks are the backbone of our financial system. I cannot understand the logic or the fairness where if you are a banking customer, and your customers want coins, you have to run down to Wal-Mart. A private citizen who orders those new coins from the U.S. Mint I am told can expect a 6 to 8 week delivery time. 
   I would like to ask the following questions. Who made the decision to give these companies, Wal-Mart particularly, the ability to distribute coins before the banks? I would like to know the name of the person who made that judgment; and what part of Arkansas he was from? Was it a procedure similar to awarding Federal contracts used in choosing Wal-Mart and General Mills? I have sent that letter to Lawrence Summers, and I hope we can get a response very soon. 
   I yield the floor and encourage everybody who has a box of Cheerios to be sure and shake it because there might be a new dollar in it. Don't go to your bank because they will not have it.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we talk a lot here about tax cuts. We talk about tax increases. But we do not often talk about changing our Tax Code. The President's proposal makes 192 separate changes to the Tax Code. The IRS book is about 5 pounds. The code itself is already 3,400 pages of text. That is 1,600 pages longer than the King James version of the Bible, and at least the Bible is large type, but you need a magnifying glass to read the IRS code. There are more than 2000 separate sections of the Code, tens of thousands of subsections, tens of thousands of pages of regulations and interpretive rulings. Now the President wants to add another 192 sections to the code which will surely make up several hundred additional pages of mindless complexity. 
   As I indicated, the President is proposing more than $95 billion of new taxes on a wide variety of industries. There are new taxes that are being proposed at a time when the Government is already taking in more than it spends. I wonder if there is any end to Washington's appetite for more money from the American people. 
   Regarding especially the President's proposal to impose $1 billion in new taxes on our mining industry, I guess he is trying to drive it offshore. The President has submitted this proposal every year for at least the past 4 years and I say this proposal is going to meet the same fate it has met every time it has been sent to the hill. It will be killed, and I can promise you that. I can assure you, the same tired, worn-out proposals to add $13 billion of new taxes to the insurance industry will never again see the light of day. I notice there are other proposals the President has proposed, but I am sure most of my colleagues share my sentiment that we do not need to raise taxes by $95 billion at this time, when most of what is contained in the tax code should be summarily rejected. 
   I conclude by saying what we need is tax reform. As a consequence, the President's proposal to add 192 separate sections to the Tax Code hardly is reform.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Motorists Privacy Act of 2000. This legislation has become necessary because technological advancements threaten to allow government and private enterprise to develop a vast database of information about the comings and goings of ordinary Americans. 
   Recently, I learned of a device known as an electronic measurement unit (EMU). EMUs are placed on billboards along highways and at the entrances to stadiums and concert locations in Atlanta, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Boston, and a variety of other cities throughout the nation. These shoe-box size devices instantly determine what radio station a car radio is tuned to by detecting electronic signals emitted from the oscillators in every car radio. 
   These devices are capable of measuring tens of thousands of radios in passing cars every day. And they provide nearly instantaneous information on the number of people listening to a radio station at any given time. This valuable data can then be sold to radio owners, who can then adjust their advertising rates based on listenership. 
   Mr. President, there is nothing wrong with surveying radio usage so long as a citizen voluntarily chooses to participate in such a survey. However, when private enterprise or the government begin to monitor radio or television usage, without the knowledge of the citizen, then a line is crossed that can only lead down the path to Big Brother. And as far as this Senator is concerned, that is not going to happen so long as I am a Member of the Senate. 
   When a citizen is sitting inside of his or her car, there is a 100 percent expectation of privacy that what is said and listened to is private. Motorists, rightfully, should have no suspicion that they are being monitored by the government or by private enterprise. However, in the case of EMUs, few motorists are aware that these devices even exist and in most cases, no attempt is made to inform motorists when they enter an area in which EMUs are utilized. 
   Mr. President, what right does a company or government have to snoop on what people are listening to in their automobiles? It is not a very great leap to imagine a world where EMUs track not only what you listen to in the car, but combined with remote television cameras, track your driving patterns. And surely, such devices could be installed in neighborhoods in order to monitor what families watch on television in their homes. Surely such invasions of privacy cannot be tolerated.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we are still in the process of trying to resolve the nuclear waste bill. As the Chair is aware, last night we laid down the substitute amendment; that has been circulated in the body. We have some amendments pending, and I will identify those at a later time. It is a very short list. Some may be deemed by the Chair to be nongermane. I think we can begin the process now of addressing this legislation in a positive vein inasmuch as it would provide a workable methodology for the Federal program to ensure that our nuclear waste is managed safely and efficiently. 
   My point in highlighting this is to identify the value of this legislation, as it stands, with the substitute filed last night. I went through an extended statement yesterday indicating that nuclear energy produces 20 percent of our electricity today. We simply cannot jeopardize our economic future by ignoring the contribution the nuclear industry makes to our Nation and the realization that the industry is choking on its waste. And the idea remains of losing 103 nuclear powerplants over a period of time because of the Federal Government's failure to honor the sanctity of the contractual commitment to take that waste in 1998, even though the ratepayers contributed some $15 billion to the Federal Government to ensure the Federal Government would have the funds to take and dispose of the waste. Well, we are all aware of the realities associated with the inability of the Government to do that, to fulfill that contract and honor the sanctity of that contractual commitment. 
   What isn't generally known or understood is the extent of liability associated with the failure of the Government to perform its contractual obligation. I have indicated that it is full employment for some lawyers. The liability is somewhere between $40 billion and $80 billion for failure of performance. 
   I think we agree that we have an obligation to come together to solve this problem on behalf of the American taxpayers, where each family is subjected to an allocation cost of about $1,400 per family in this country each year as we delay the process. We have made substantial progress in addressing these issues and working with my friends from Utah--and I am sensitive to their particular position--as well as the minority and the ranking member from New Mexico, for whom I have the greatest respect. As a consequence, I believe this bill provides significant benefits to the consumers, who have paid $15 billion-plus for this Federal disposal program, and the program direction we have in this legislation for the Energy Department which must carry out this important environmental obligation. 
   Now, the Senate should pass this legislation. The administration should support this approach to solving this critical national issue. 
   Senate bill 1287 provides important changes to existing law as embodied in my new substitute that allows the Department of Energy to meet its 1998 obligation to manage used nuclear fuel from nuclear powerplants which have already begun to run out of space in especially designed storage pools. 
   Further, it allows for the settlement of litigation, begins a process of settlement for litigation between these utilities and the Energy Department in a fair way, and eliminates costly litigation against the Federal government, hence the taxpayer. 
   This bill would protect the use of billions of dollars in the nuclear waste fund so it is used only for the repository program and not diverted to cover  the cost of long-term storage at these plants in some 40 States. 
   The fund itself could be used, however, to purchase containers to house the fuel. Those containers were used also to ship the fuel to a repository. I am not suggesting that is the case, but that is possible.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I know a lot of people who come to Alaska and visit ``Valdeez'' think it is pronounced ``Valdez.'' 
   But I did want to highlight the fact we have tried to respond to the request for the land conveyances. They are 76,000 acres transferred over to the two counties that would benefit the communities. That is in this bill. I offer it simply as an effort in good faith to be sensitive to concerns I think are very legitimate. That is to transfer the land from Federal agencies that do not have a need for that land to the communities so they can put them on the tax rolls and have it functionally contribute to the economy of the area and benefit the people. I think that is appropriate as well. 
   I see a few Members here awaiting recognition. It is appropriate I yield the floor. At a later time, it will be my intention to address some of the amendments that are pending. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Yes. I certainly agree with my colleague from Nevada. That hour is to be split between both sides. 
   I would like to continue for a moment, if I may. There are a couple of points that I think are necessary to highlight. They concern the issue of the Environmental Protection Agency and just what the role is as determined by the changes we made. 
   I refer to language that is on pages 3, 4, and 5 as opposed to the statement we have from the administration on their  position. I should point out, that statement was given on February 8. It is a statement of administration policy. It states that as of February 4, 2000, the manager's amendment to S. 1287--I understand this amendment will be brought to the floor--undermines EPA's existing statutory authority to 
   set standards to protect public health and the environment from radioactive releases. As a consequence, it is unacceptable to the administration because they say it undermines EPA's existing statutory authority and is, therefore, unacceptable. 
   They further acknowledge that the amendment allows EPA to exercise its existing authority to set appropriate radiation release standards for Yucca Mountain. It will allow another entity to block EPA's authority until June 1, 2001. Consequently, if the February 4, 2000, manager's amendment to S. 1287 is approved, and if the Senate bill with these provisions is presented to the President, the President will veto the bill. 
   I appeal to the administration. According to the Washington Post article which I read, the White House says it opposes the bill because it would take away from the EPA the sole authority to determine radiation exposure requirements at a future permanent waste repository if it is built in Nevada. 
   Let me read what it says.  
   Adoption of standard: 
   Notwithstanding the time schedule in section 801 of the Energy Policy Act, the administration shall not publish or adopt a public health and safety standard for the protection of the public from releases from radioactive materials stored or disposed of in the repository at the Yucca Mountain site except in accordance with this section before June 1st, 2001.  
   To suggest that they don't have the sole authority is not what the legislation says. It says they shall not have the authority to publish or adopt before June 1st, 2001. 
   Further, relative to this portion, it says: not later than April 1st, 2001, the Commission and the National Academy of Sciences shall, based on the proposed rule and the information provided by the Administrator--that is, the Administrator of EPA--under paragraph 1, shall submit a report to Congress on whether the proposed rule is consistent about section 801 of the Energy Policy Act; 
   Or, B, provides a reasonable expectation of the public health and safety and the environment will be adequately protected from the hazards posed by high-level radioactive waste and spent fuel disposed of in the repository; 
   And, C, it is based on the best reasonable obtainable scientific and technical information concerning the need for and consequences of the rule; 
   And, D, imposes the least burden consistent with obtaining the regulatory objective of protecting the public health and safety and the environment. 
   No. 3, in the event that either the Commission--that is, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission--or the National Academy of Sciences finds the proposed rule does not meet one or more of the criteria issued in paragraph 2, it shall notify the Administrator--that is, the EPA Administrator--not later than April 1st, 2001, of its finding and the basis for such finding. 
   I repeat that the Environmental Protection Agency has the final say and, under the statute, shall have the sole authority to address the levels of radiation but not before June 1st, 2001. 
   We have not heard from the administration relative to those changes. I hope the administration will be sensitive to our effort to ensure that, indeed, the Environmental Protection Agency will have the last word. 
   The objective is not to take away from the obligation of the EPA, which has the authority under statute. The effort is to bring forth the best science available. If the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that licensed and monitors the plants has more Ph.D.s in the area of nuclear science and the National Academy of Sciences can contribute something, is that not in the public interest? 
   Again, I appeal to my colleagues to recognize our bottom line is simply to have an emission standard that is attainable and that allows Congress to address a final resting place for the waste. 
   Senator KERREY's office advised me he wishes to be deleted as a cosponsor of the amendment. I ask unanimous consent that request be honored.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I assure my colleagues, Senator BINGAMAN, and the administration of our willingness to use the remaining time to try to be responsive to their concerns. 
   I will summarize the situation. We have been at this a long time. We all agree we have an obligation as elected representatives to resolve this problem. The failure of the Government--certainly not under this Secretary of Energy--to take the waste in January of 1998 is what we are living with today. The ratepayers have paid $15 billion in electric rates on their bills with the assumption the Federal Government would take that waste; the damages and the claims go on and on and on as a consequence of time passing as that waste remains at the sites of our nuclear plants. The nearest estimate we have is $40 billion to $80 billion. The longer we wait, the greater the burden of the taxpayer. I think the public looks to Congress to address this with resolve. 
   Some have suggested this administration simply does not want to resolve this matter on its watch. That may be the basic position of the administration. That may be justified in their minds. There is another group out there that sees the passage of this legislation to resolve what we will do with our nuclear waste as some kind of a significant benefit to the nuclear industry. If they can defeat this and bring the industry to its knees by causing it to choke on its own waste, nuclear power as we know in this country will die. It will reach a slow process of strangling on that waste, the nuclear power industry will go away, and we will simply generate power from some other source. 
   The difficulty I have with that is the inability to identify what that other source will be and what it will do to our air quality. To me there is a tradeoff in the process. If we lose the nuclear power generating capacity, which is about 20 percent in this Nation, what will we replace it with? 
   We have to solve the waste problem. If this administration does not want it to occur on its watch, we are still going to have to solve it under another administration, whether it be Republican or Democratic, or we are simply going to add this obligation of the damages to the American taxpayer. I think we are all in agreement that we simply must deal with it. We have an equal responsibility. 
   I gave an interview a few minutes ago. The first question was: Senator, why can't you resolve this? I am sure all my colleagues know why we can't resolve it. Nobody wants the waste. 
   Unfortunately for our good friend from Nevada, a decision was made to proceed with Yucca as a permanent repository some time ago. We have spent over $6 billion. The tunnel is drilled. We are awaiting licensing. That is where we are. 
   I am also told the administration is split on this. Some would like to see it resolved. Some don't want it resolved at all. 
   I guess it rests with each Member to recognize his or her responsibility as elected representatives to bring this to a resolve responsibly. If somebody else has a better idea of how to resolve it responsibly, they can certainly have this dais, the microphone, and whatever else goes with it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Alabama. He has highlighted some points that certainly needed to be identified. In reality, the issue is twofold. 
   No. 1, are we going to have a future in this country for the nuclear power generating capability associated with our power industry? Is that in the future of this country? Or are we hell-bent to kill it? 
   Further, do we want this high-level waste stored at 80-some-odd sites in 40 States for an extended period of time or do we want to get on with the job of collecting it and putting it in one permanent repository? 
   Listening to the debate, I am sensitive to the difficulties associated with the decision that was made at a time when we had a Democratic chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, my good friend, Senator Bennett Johnston. This has been a tough vote for my colleagues from Nevada. I recall a Republican Senator who probably lost the election in his State. He fought valiantly against putting the waste there. But, as I have identified time and time again, nobody wants the waste. That is the first premise with which you enter into this discussion. But you have to put it somewhere because it will not stay up in the air. As a consequence, we find ourselves still debating the issue. 
   At the hearing we had in the Energy Committee some time ago, the statement was made by our colleagues that regardless of the science, they would have to oppose the selection of a site in Nevada. Let's face it; that is a tough set of circumstances. But we have a job to do because we have to put it somewhere. 
   I do not want to oversimplify it. My friend said the bill is a lemon; it is ugly. I do not dispute that. But Nevada has been selected for the permanent repository, assuming it can be licensed. That is the hard fact. It might not be pretty. I guess I would say that we have, really, no other alternative because it is critical that we maintain a nuclear power industry in this country. 
   We have had a conversation about removing the take title. It has been removed. I know that disturbs my good friend and ranking member from the State of New Mexico. Secretary Richardson, the Secretary of Energy, raised this issue. I have held it in the legislation until the very end. But it became obvious that the administration could not deliver on their promises, that they could reassure the States that this was not just another ruse or another broken promise. And the broken promises obviously go back to 1998 when the Federal Government did not deliver on its contractual commitments to take the waste. The administration simply could not assure the States that they would not become some 40 repositories, which is what they are now. 
   I know the Secretary of Energy did the best he could, but it simply could not be done. So it is quite natural these States would say: Wait a minute, the Federal Government has not performed on its contractual commitment. Now it wants to take title in our State, without giving us the assurance it is going to be moved. As a consequence, as my colleagues know, those States were represented in the letter I introduced into the RECORD from six States claiming they would urge their representatives in the Senate not to support legislation unless the take title was removed. 
   I do not fault the Secretary of Energy. But I think it is fair to say the administration has not had its act together for 
   one reason or another. Maybe it is to accommodate my friends from Nevada, but, nevertheless, it has not been resolved. 
   I tried my best. I am willing to revisit this in the future if the administration can follow through with some type of commitment. But I think it is unfair for the administration to criticize legislation because of their failure to follow through on their commitment. That is where we are on this. 
   We have heard suggestions from our friends from Nevada that putting the issuance of a radiation standard off is politicizing the process. We can point fingers around here because this is a political body. But if we look at the facts, the opposite is probably true. 
   The administration chose to abandon sound science and to inject politics into the standard-setting as part of its opposition to the use of nuclear power. Under the law, the Energy Policy Act, the EPA was to follow the guidelines set by the National Academy of Sciences. The National Academy is not an appointed body. Its membership is elected, based on professional scientific background, by the other scientists. The National Academy called for ``all pathways'' as a standard. 
   EPA chose to go outside that guideline and threatened to create a separate groundwater standard in addition to the ``all pathways.'' I guess the only reason was to frustrate the development of the repository. They ignored science and yet injected politics. If anything, I think my amendment will remove politics from the process, and that is my objective. 
   Talking about whether or not this is environmental legislation, the Senator said environmental groups oppose this legislation and the League of Conservation Voters is watching every one of us. Think about that. Here is an environmental agency that is genuinely concerned about the safety, health, and welfare of people regarding issues it  has every right to be involved in. But what is its objective? Is the objective to kill the nuclear power industry in this country? Is that the true objective? I wonder. Because maybe the League of Conservation Voters, as they indicate their opposition to this legislation, indicating they are watching, thinks having spent fuel spread around this country at 80 sites in 40 States is a good idea. 
   I do not think so and I do not think the majority of Senators think so. Maybe they think shutting down 20 percent of our generating capacity is a good idea, when they do not come up with any alternative. What do they want us to do? Maybe they will ignore that we will have to replace that capacity with fossil fuel-fired plants. Is that what they want? They do not have to take the responsibility that you and I do, to come up with and address an alternative. It is very appropriate that they criticize, but I wonder where they are going. Are they really going to shut down the nuclear power industry? They do not say that. 
   Maybe they do not care about the cost to the taxpayers, the elderly, the poor, when we have to replace that capacity at the taxpayers' expense--the ratepayers' expense. 
   Maybe they do not have a better use for the $80 billion, or whatever it is, in liability we are facing as a consequence of this delay. They have a responsibility to come up with answers, and they do not accept that responsibility. As a consequence, I find fault with their logic as well as their objective. 
   Maybe they simply do not care. Maybe they do not care about human health and safety or the environment or the cost and the impact on the taxpayers, the poor or the elderly, because they want to pursue their own agenda. Is that a political agenda? I think it is. It is a political agenda against nuclear power. 
   This is a major environmental bill, and if you are not for the environment in moving this quantity of high-level nuclear fuel to one site, how in the world can you suggest in any manner or form that you are for the environment by leaving it at these sites? It does not belong there. The sites were not designed for it. It is contrary to the health and welfare of the public. 
   What we have here is a progressive bill to address the problem. I say to those who receive threats or notification on the merits of the environmental aspect that this is not a good environmental bill, this is an environmental bill that addresses and solves the problem.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in paragraph 2, it states:  
   No one disagrees that nuclear waste belongs in a single safe repository far removed from the population centers. Yucca Mountain, located on the Nevada Test Site, which S. 1287 designates as the site, is just such a facility.  
   On page 2:  
   The fact is that there has never been any human injury or environmental damage in the transportation of nuclear waste.......  
   In the last paragraph:  
   For these reasons, the Teamster Union believes S. 1287 is a well-reasoned, balanced approach to solving an on-going, continuously growing problem of nuclear waste. We urge you to support it as it moves to the Senate floor.  
   It is signed Michael E. Mathis, Director of Government Affairs. 
   As we wind down this debate, I again urge we all focus on the reality of whether we want to kill the nuclear industry in this country, if that is the objective, or whether we want to get on with addressing the responsibility which we have, which is to address what we are going to do with this high-level waste. 
   Since we have been committed at the expense of some $6 billion at Yucca Mountain, since we have in this legislation addressed the appropriate role of the Environmental Protection Agency as having the final say on the determination of what the radiation standards should be, since we have addressed the transportation system by leaving it up to the States to designate how and where and under what terms and conditions, the waste will move out of the States where it presently resides. We have met the challenge we have been charged to address. As a consequence, we should recognize that it is time to finally put this matter behind us and not contribute additional expense to the American taxpayers or the ratepayers who have been paying into this fund for the last several years. 
   I save the remainder of my remarks for the remaining time tomorrow where I understand the proponents and opponents have an hour equally divided beginning at 10 o'clock, with a vote scheduled at 11. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor for comments by my colleague.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we have a historic opportunity today to resolve a problem that has been occurring ever since the first nuclear plant came online in this country. That date was 1960. 
   The question was: While we now have this new source of power, clean generation, what are we going to do with the waste? 
   Today we have an opportunity to resolve what we are going to do with that waste. It is an obligation that goes across party lines. It is an obligation, it is a responsibility, it is a commitment, to resolve this once and for all. 
   How long have we been at this? One can go back 17 years when it was addressed at great length in an energy package that was debated at great length, but the portion on what to do with high-level nuclear waste was not resolved. 
   Over a period of time, it was agreed that the Federal Government would enter into a contractual commitment to take the waste in the year 1998. That went by and, as a consequence, we find ourselves in the situation where the ratepayers in this country who have the benefit of nuclear clean power have paid in some $15 billion to the Federal Government. 
   Where did that go? It did not go into an escrow account. It went into the general fund. But those ratepayers and those power-generating companies, utilities, went into that contractual agreement with the Federal Government in good faith, believing that the contract would be honored by the Federal Government, believing that, indeed, the Federal Government was under an obligation under the sanctity of contract principle to honor the contractual commitment. 
   The Federal Government has not honored that commitment and, as a consequence, we are dealing with an exposure to the American taxpayer of some $40 billion to $80 billion in damages associated with the inability of the Government to come to terms with the contractual commitment it made with the utilities. 
   Each day we delay resolving how we are going to take that waste subjects the American taxpayer to additional liability. We did a little calculation, and the additional liability to each and every American family is somewhere between $1,300 and $1,400. That is the liability that extends to the American family. That is why, in spite of the differences as to how we resolve this problem, the commitment should be to resolve this problem with the legislation we have or the amendments that will be forthcoming. 
   There is a tradeoff. We have had clean power from these nuclear plants. These are not isolated sources of power. These plants contribute approximately 20 percent of the domestic energy produced in this country. 
   What is the tradeoff? The tradeoff is what we are going to do with the waste. We made a commitment to put that waste at Yucca Mountain. We have expended in excess of $6 billion on Yucca Mountain. There is a procedure to go through before Yucca Mountain can be licensed. But I remind my colleagues and staff and those who are following this debate, we simply must deal with it. 
   The Senator from Alaska does not have a constituency in his State relative to nuclear power. 
   We had a small plant at a military base at one time, but it is long since gone. 
   But as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I have a responsibility to address this. I have a responsibility to the taxpayers. I have a responsibility to every Member of this body. That is what the professional staffs of both sides, Senator BINGAMAN, as the ranking member, and myself, have been working towards. 
   We simply cannot address this debate in the theory of: If we don't like this aspect or we don't like that aspect, if we can't come to terms on one point or another, we are going to simply throw the baby out. That is absolutely irresponsible. It is mandatory that we come together now and resolve this issue because we have that responsibility to the taxpayers of this country. 
   What is the administration's position on it? I can probably honestly say it is split. That may mean they are for certain aspects we have come to terms with but are opposed to certain other aspects. But I implore the administration to recognize that they have an obligation to come to grips with the contractual commitment that was made. The Department of Energy, as the lead agency, has to address how it is going to come about. 
   I have had numerous conversations with Secretary Richardson. I think we have made progress. But the reality is, if we are going to pick this legislation apart and lose sight of our objective, I am wasting my time and, Mr. President, you are wasting your time listening to me because we are not going to get anywhere. We have to come into this debate committed to working this out and resolving this so we can address the problems associated with what we are going to do with that waste. 
   I am not here to lament on what others are doing with high-level waste. We know what the French are doing. They are reprocessing their waste. They recover the plutonium. They put it back in the reactors. They vitrify the waste which has less life and is disposed of. We do not have that policy in this country. We may have it someday, but we are committed to a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. 
   You are going to hear a lot from my Nevada colleagues, as you should, because the difficulty with this issue is nobody wants the waste. You cannot throw it up in the air because it has to come down somewhere. That is all there is to it. When you have a situation where nobody wants it, you have a real problem because those that come from the area where it is proposed to go are going to do everything they can to stop it. 
   That is the situation with regard to my colleagues from Nevada. Let's be honest with one another. They have a vested interest. They don't want it in their State. But we have to put it somewhere. 
   Let me refer to a couple of charts here because I think it represents reality and where we are today. 
   The chosen site for the waste is Yucca Mountain in Nevada. Everybody, I assume, knows where Nevada is. It is next to California and Arizona. But what we also have on this chart is where the waste currently is. You have it all over the East Coast. You have it in the Chicago, IL, area. You have it along the West Coast, and in south Texas, and so forth. 
   What we are looking at here, shown in brown on the chart, are the commercial 
   reactors. These are the power-generating reactors in the various States that generate power to light the homes, light the sidewalks, light the highways, heat the homes, heat the hot water tanks. This represents 20 percent of the energy in this country. 
   The storage facilities where this waste is were designed to hold a specific volume of waste. That volume was  basically controlled by the various States. Many of these facilities are full or about to be full. These States are either going to allow the increase of that storage in their State or in the reactor pool or those reactors are going to have to be shut down. If you shut down the reactors, where are you going to pick up the power? 
   The critics of nuclear energy don't care about that because they do not want to see nuclear energy expanded to any extent. They are not interested in where you are going to get the power from another source. But you only have so many alternatives. You can put in more coal-fire plants. That does not do anything for air quality. Some suggest we just hook up to gas, that gas is cheap. 
   But the National Petroleum Council came out with a report the other day that suggests that if those people think they are going to be able to plug into gas, they have another thing coming. The infrastructure isn't there for the volume demand. We are using about 20 trillion cubic feet of gas currently in this country. It is anticipated in the next 10 years that will be up over 31 trillion cubic feet of gas. 
   We have a problem with access in the areas on public lands, where we could initiate exploration for gas, because this administration simply will not open up public lands or offshore areas, for the most part. Where are you going to find the new gas necessary to meet the anticipated demand, even without the exposure associated with the issue at hand; that is, what to do with the high-level waste? 
   The other issue with the gas, as I have indicated, is the infrastructure isn't there yet. To suggest it is going to be cheap, you have another thing coming. It is not going to be cheap. The price is going to increase. It is estimated the demand for gas, at the end of the next 10-year period of time, is going to amount to about 14 million new users. It is going to require an investment of about $1.5 trillion. So for those people who suggest we just go get gas, that is not realistic. 
   Some people say: Let's go to solar. It gets dark at night, in case some have not noticed. In my State of Alaska, in the wintertime it is a long night. 
   Wind. Sometimes the wind does not blow. 
   So for a long time we are going to be looking to our conventional fossil fuel sources. We should be looking to the role of nuclear. 
   But my point is, this chart highlights where the nuclear waste is. It is in 40 States. If we don't do something about this now, with this legislation, it is going to stay in those 40 States. There are 80 sites where various reactors are located in the 40 States. 
   There is another contributing consideration to which every Member ought to be very sensitive. We have shut down reactors with spent fuel. We have them in California. We have them over here on the East Coast. We have several throughout the country--in Oregon. 
   What are we going to do with that waste in those shut down reactors? The alternative is to leave it there. Do you want to leave it there? Nobody wants to leave it there. They want to move it. 
   We have commercial spent nuclear fuel storage facilities where we have waste in a number of States. That is shown on the chart in black. As a consequence, that will stay. 
   We have non-Department of Energy research reactors in States which are shown in green on the chart. What do we do with that? Leave it? 
   We have naval reactor fuel in Idaho and the State of Washington which are shown in yellow on the chart. 
   There is DOE-owned spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste strung around the country at various places. 
   To those who say this isn't a crisis, that we don't really have a responsibility here, I say that logic is simply ducking the responsibility. We have to address a resolve of this issue at this time. 
   We have to address what to do with the waste. We have to get it out of the areas where it currently resides. Those areas were not designed to hold and maintain that waste indefinitely. 
   They were designed to hold the waste up to their licensed capacity. So that is the problem we have now. 
   I want to go through and try to regionalize and personalize how significant this crisis is by a series of charts, the first of which will show you where we propose to put this waste in Nevada, in the desert. We have a chart that shows the area out at Yucca Mountain as it exists today. This is the proposed location for the permanent repository at the Nevada site. 
   I am sensitive to the reality that this is the soil of the State of Nevada. But I am also a realist and recognize that, for 50 years, we have been using this area for nuclear testing. It is hot, Mr. President. We have had over 800 nuclear weapons tests in this area. If you believe in the theory that an area, at some point in time, becomes pretty heavily polluted--if I can use the word--does it make sense, then, to try to recognize a site for what it is and ask, well, if the geological area is sufficient, is this a good site for a permanent nuclear repository underground? 
   That selection was made a long time ago, so that is not the issue today. The issue is how we are going to proceed with an understanding of how we can go forth, begin to move the waste, when this site is licensed by the various agencies and we can proceed in placing the waste in that permanent repository where we have spent $6 billion. 
   I have been there. I have been through the tunnel. The tunneling is basically done. If we don't put it there, where are we going to put it? Some say, leave it at the site. Some others say, put it in casks above ground and store it. Well, then what do you do with it--put it off? Remember, all this time, we are in violation of our contractual commitment to take the waste in 1998. So the clock ticks. There is a full employment act for lawyers who are filing damage suits. They love this delay. The American taxpayer doesn't know what is hitting him because the damages click on. That is why we have an obligation as Members of this body to address and resolve this now. 
   Let's go through some of the 40 States that are affected. I hope that the staffs of each of the States watch this. If you disagree with me, that is fine. Get ahold of the staff and we will try to proceed. 
   Arkansas. A few of our prominent people come from Arkansas. Arkansas residents paid over $365 million into that waste fund in their utility bills. There are two units, Nuclear Unit 1 and 2. The waste stored is 690 metric tons. Their waste--under their permit, unit 1 runs out in 1996 and unit 2, in 1997. Those dates have passed. The State of Arkansas gets 33 percent of its electricity from nuclear energy. These charts were made up some time ago. So the waste stored now is more. The question of whether Arkansas is going to increase its licensing is up to the folks from Arkansas. But the point is, that is one State. We have 40 States. I am going to go through a few of them. 
   Connecticut. Residents paid in $655 million. They have two units, Millstone 2 and 3. Waste stored is 1,445 metric tons, DOE/defense waste. Millstone 2 runs out in 2 years; Millstone 3, in 2003. That State is 43-percent dependent on nuclear energy. That is the hard cold fact. 
   Massachusetts. Their waste fund is $156 million. One unit, Pilgrim 1. Waste stored is 495 metric tons. There is a vacancy if they install new racks. The State's electricity is 
   12-percent dependent. 
   Oregon. The waste fund is $108 million. One unit, Trojan. Waste stored is 424 metric tons. Hanford site, waste stored is 2,133 metric tons. Trojan closed for decommissioning. Think about that. Do you know what that means? That means that waste isn't going to go anywhere other than to stay in Oregon, unless we pass some legislation that proceeds in a process so we can move this waste out of these sites. 
   Moving south, Louisiana. Residents paid $339 million. Two units, Riverbend 1 and Waterford 3. There are 567 metric tons stored. Waterford runs out in 2002; Riverbend, 2007. Louisiana is 22-percent dependent on nuclear energy. 
   Illinois. The waste fund is $2 billion. The residents of the State of Illinois have paid $2 billion in their electric bills. The reason they paid that is so the Federal Government would honor its contract and take the waste in 1998. They have 11 units: Braidwood 1 and 2; Bryon 1 and 2; Clinton; Dresden 2 and 3; La Salle 1 and 2; Quad Cities 1 and 2.  DOE research reactor full, stored 40 metric tons. Dresden 3 expires in 2000. Dresden 2 expires in 2002. Clinton expires in 2003. Quad Cities expires in 2006. Zion expires in 2006. La Salle expires in 2013. Bryon expires in 2005. Braidwood expires in 2019. The State is 39-percent dependent. 
   From where is this power going to come? Not from thin air. Somebody has to produce it. Do you want a brownout? These plants are in violation after that date. There is a necessity of us resolving this in a bipartisan manner. We have that obligation. We should make a commitment on this floor to proceed with the objective of solving this. 
   Michigan. Their waste fund is $696 million. There are four units: Cook 1 and 2; Fermi 2; Palisades. Waste stored is 1,493 metric tons. DOE research reactor. Palisades expires in 1992; Fermi, in 2001; Cook, in 2014. The State is 24-percent nuclear dependent. 
   Wisconsin. I remind my fellow colleagues from these States that if we don't do anything, it is going to stay right in your State. Is that what you want to have happen? In Wisconsin, the waste fund is $344 million. They have three units, Kewaunee and Point Beach. Waste stored is 967 metric tons. Point Beach expires in 1995. Kewaunee expires in 2001. They are 8-percent dependent. Maybe they are waiting on the assumption that we are going to address this problem once and for all. 
   Georgia, in the South. Their waste fund is $529 million. They have four units: Hatch 1 and 2, Vogtle 1 and 2. The waste stored is 1,182 metric tons. The Savannah River site waste stored is 206 metric tons. Hatch 1 and 2 were out in 1999. The State is 30-percent dependent. 
   Washington State. The waste fund is $344 million. One unit, WNP 2. Waste stored is 292 metric tons. They are up this year. State's electricity is 6 percent. To a large degree, they depend on hydro, but they still have a problem. 
   Maine. Their waste fund is $233 million. One unit shut down, Maine Yankee. Waste stored is 536 metric tons. Does Maine want that waste to sit there? 
   Do the elected Representatives of the State of Maine want this waste to sit there or move it to one central location that was designed to take the waste? 
   I see my colleague from Pennsylvania on the floor. In his State, the ratepayers have paid $1.338 million for the waste fund. They paid $245 million in their electric bills. They have nine units: Beaver Valley, Limerick, Peach Bottom, Susquehanna, Three Mile Island, and 3,327 metric tons. Beaver Valley is out in 2015, Limerick is out in 2005, Peach Bottom is out in 1999, and Susquehanna is out in 1998. Pennsylvania has a generating capacity of 34 percent which is dependent on nuclear energy. 
   Finally, Vermont. I am not going to go through all States. But I want to make the point that $186 million has been paid by the ratepayers with one unit. 
   Vermont Yankee: Waste stored, 429 metric tons. Vermont Yankee runs out in 2005. In this State, generating capacity is 73 percent nuclear energy. 
   I think that highlights my point that there are very few States that are exempt. Out of the 50 States, there are about 10 that have no nuclear waste in their States. 
   Again, the locations of the spent fuel and radioactive waste designed for geologic disposal are all of these colors. From all of these places it is going to go to the proposed one site at Yucca Mountain. How can we work with Nevada to reach some kind of an accord? 
   That is tough because Nevada doesn't want it as a principle, but it creates jobs. But, by the same token, they are very sensitive to this. I can appreciate that sensitivity. I again appeal to reason. We have to put it somewhere. We identified this as the appropriate place. 
   We are proceeding with the process of licensing. We have an obligation as elected Representatives to resolve the problem. It is not a partisan issue. I defer the thought process to the obligation we are putting on the taxpayers as we put off, whether it be the Senate, the House, or the administration, reaching a decision on how to proceed with this because it is costing the taxpayers more money. One of these days the taxpayers are going to wake up to the fact that each family in this country is carrying a proportionate share of between $1,300 and $1,400 for the damages that are anticipated associated with the inability of the Government to take that waste in 1998 as it agreed to do under a contractual commitment, let alone overlooking the fact that the ratepayers have paid $15 billion to the Federal Government to take the waste. 
   It is beyond me as to why the current administration has not been more aggressive in saying, yes, it is our responsibility to get it resolved. We have had a number of objections from the administration over the years in the process of trying to proceed with this. 
   These objections cover a series of legitimate concerns. But I think in some sense they have lost sight of what our objective had to be, and that is to recognize we have the obligation to resolve the problem. 
   I met with the Secretary of Energy early last year. At that time, we were hung up on how to proceed and what to do about the extended litigation that was occurring as a consequence of the Government's inability to honor the contractual commitment. The issue was, well, how can we find a compromise? We agreed to meet the administration's proposal 
   that the Department of Energy may take title to spent fuel and may pay some of the costs of that storage. That was a significant good-faith effort to try to reach an accord. 
   The other alternative would have been the utility simply suing the Federal Government. But this was the suggestion of the Secretary. We concurred and agreed with it. 
   The other issue was the concern of previous bills which would allow interim storage to occur at Yucca Mountain until Yucca Mountain was licensed. This is important because we need relief. The most immediate way to get relief is to begin moving this waste to Yucca for temporary storage in casks on the surface until such time as Yucca Mountain is licensed and the waste can be put in a permanent repository. The administration opposed that. Nevada opposed that because they looked at it as the last straw and with certainty that the waste was definitely going to Nevada. We were trying to find a way to remove the crucial time element where some of these plants had to shut down, move the waste out under some plan, and put it in casks on the surface until such time as Yucca Mountain opened. We dropped that at the insistence of the administration. We eliminated the ability to temporarily move that waste until Yucca could be licensed. 
   That was a very significant effort to come to grips with the concerns of the administration. But clearly the administration was concerned about elections in Nevada. I can understand that and appreciate that. We didn't move the waste into temporary storage. Now the question that seems to be crucial is how we are going to get a radiation standard that is attainable. It is a legitimate question. 
   We are proposing to get the best science available. What is the best science? There is a lot of science out there. We want a radiation standard that will be attainable which will allow us at such time as Yucca is licensed to be able to move the waste there. If we have a standard that is unattainable, this whole thing is for naught. We will have expanded dramatically the obligation of the American taxpayer not only in damages where we failed to adhere to the sanctity of the contract but damages associated with further delay. 
   We have proposed in general terms to bring with the best science, which is pretty hard to do in this kind of climate. That science consists of those who are very familiar with items of this nature. One of them is the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which licensed the plants and which has probably more Ph.D.s associated with the nuclear industry and nuclear issues than any other agency--to bring that agency together with the National Academy of Sciences and the Environmental Protection Agency to work towards a solution on a radiation standard in a positive sense so that we have good, sound science. We have a problem with that to some extent. 
   I hope we can come to grips and recognize in the spirit of good faith the objective is to get the best science, from whatever sources. 
   The EPA has the final obligation for rulemaking. However, we are proposing that not occur until after June of the year 2001. In the meantime, we want them to come together to achieve an  attainable level of a radiation standard with which we can live. The radiation standards are all over the ballpark. They are in the eyes of the beholder. 
   In this debate, we will have an opportunity to explain at greater length the concern we have that, after completing this process, the Environmental Protection Agency promulgates a rule on radiation standards that is simply unattainable. If everything were equal in evaluating this, I would not have that concern. However, there are some in this country, including environmental groups--and I am sure the National Academy of Science as well as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission perhaps to a lesser extent, but certainly within the Environmental Protection Agency--who would like to see no solution. 
   What is their motivation? There is a fear that somehow we will expand nuclear energy or the role of nuclear energy. Some suggest if we overcome what to do with the waste, it will stimulate the construction of new plants. 
   I am not here as an advocate of nuclear energy, but I am here as a realist to recognize we cannot have it both ways. We are concerned about air quality. We are concerned about global climate change. We are concerned about Kyoto. We should be. Is there a role for nuclear energy? There should be. From the administration, the Vice President, no mention is made of the role of nuclear energy in any proposals on climate change. One can only assume that the environmental groups that oppose the nuclear industry prevail in the mindset associated within the administration. If they do, that is fine; let's be open. But we should recognize we have an obligation to come up with an alternative. 
   To suggest the solution is simply to let this industry choke on its own waste is unrealistic and irresponsible. That is why we must work in a bipartisan manner for a solution and not lose sight of our objective, which occurs around here, by getting hung up on various aspects of detail and legalistic language. We are either going to move this waste or we are not. If we move it, we are going to save the American taxpayer money. We will adhere to the sanctity of the contractual agreement to take that waste in 1998. That is where we are. 
   Mr. President, I know my colleagues want to be heard and we have not entered into any time agreement. Ordinarily, we break for the policy luncheon. I believe we have a cloture vote scheduled at 2:15. Without losing my right to the floor, how can we accommodate our colleagues, recognizing we have a limited time?

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to my friend. I hope in a bipartisan spirit we can come to grips with our obligation to resolve this issue to benefit the American taxpayer as a renewed sanctity of the contractual commitment the Federal Government has made. 
   I pledge to work with the Senator and my colleagues from Nevada in that spirit in hopes we can reach a satisfactory resolution and not be buried in an impossible situation that simply detracts from our objective. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is my intention to continue the debate on the manager's amendment to S. 1287, the Nuclear Policy Act Amendments of 1999. It is appropriate to highlight a couple more charts before I explain what this manager's substitute does. 
   I will reiterate the purpose of addressing the responsibility we have as the Senate to resolve what we are going to do to dispose of this high-level waste in conformance with the contractual commitment that the Department of Energy and the Federal Government entered into to take the waste beginning in January of 1998. 
   As I indicated earlier today, the Federal Government is derelict in not meeting its fiduciary responsibility. It is appropriate to point out that the ratepayers in this country have paid $15 billion to the Federal Government to take that waste beginning in 1998. Damages for nonperformance to the contractual commitment by the power industry in this country against the Federal Government suggests the liability is somewhere between $40 billion and $80 billion. The longer this body delays in addressing its responsibility of disposal of this waste, the greater the obligation to the American taxpayer, which currently is estimated to be about $1,400 per family. 
   As a consequence, we have the responsibility, in a bipartisan manner, to come together and resolve the obligation we were elected to address, and that is to meet contractual commitments, honor the sanctity of the contract, and resolve the waste problem and not allow the nuclear industry to, basically, choke on its own waste. 
   There are a couple of charts with which I want to proceed. First of all, I want to identify, again, the locations of the waste for those who may have missed it earlier. Around this country, there are approximately 80 sites. One can see the sites on the map: the commercial reactors, the shut down reactors with spent fuel onsite; and they will not be removed unless we proceed with this legislation to address one site at Yucca Mountain in Nevada for a permanent repository. It also includes the commercial spent nuclear fuel storage, the non-DOE research reactor, the naval reactors, and the DOE-owned spent nuclear fuel. My point is simply to show we have 80 sites in 40 States. It is an obligation we have to universally address this with appropriate resolve. 
   The next chart shows radiation exposure. This is very important and very germane to the debate because we are all concerned about the manner in which the radiation exposure will be addressed and by what agency. 
   I am not here to promulgate who has the best science, but I think it is fair to say this issue deserves the very best science. Traditionally, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission addresses licensing, examination, and conformance of nuclear plants. They are pretty good at it. They probably have more Ph.D.s than any other agency dealing with nuclear radiation. 
   However, the National Academy of Sciences also has a great deal of expertise, and we are suggesting that their scientific contribution be part of a determination on setting a radiation level that will conform to, as well as achieve, our objective, and that is to put the waste in a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain. 
   There is a lot of concern about radiation. I think it has to be put in some perspective that is understandable. 
   For those working in this Capitol, they get 80 millirems of exposure each year. 
   If one is living in a brick house, they get 70 millirems per year. 
   The exposure from cosmic radiation to residents in Denver is 53 millirems. 
   The average annual radiation exposure from the ground is 26 millirems. 
   Diagnostic x-rays are 20 millirems. 
   Dental x-rays are 14 millirems. 
   If one flies from New York to Los Angeles, they get 6 millirems. 
   Exposure for half an hour from a transport container on a truck 6 feet away--let's assume they are moving this in a prescribed cask, transporting it by rail or by highway with an escort--the exposure is 5 millirems. 
   These are accurate measurements. The EPA's proposed radiation exposure level is 4 millirems, and that is a ground water standard. 
   I am not going to argue the merits of EPA other than to say that their exposure level, from the standpoint of its relationship with these other exposure levels, seems a little out of line. We will let it go at that because I want to move on. I want to make the point, as we look at radiation exposure levels, it is important to keep in perspective what we are exposed to already. 
   Let's look at transportation because that is going to be debated extensively. We have been transporting used 
   fuel from 1964 through 1997, as this chart shows. These are the routes used for 2,913 shipments. Obviously, they have been going through all the States. They have been going by railroad through Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, a portion of Nebraska, I believe Missouri, and a couple of other States, as indicated in red. We are and have been moving these shipments. The significance of this is that the public health has never been exposed to radiation from spent fuel cargo. We have never had an exposure. That does not mean it cannot happen; it means we have taken practical safeguards to ensure the exposure is at a minimum. 
   I learned a long time ago in my State of Alaska when we had the Exxon Valdez accident that these accidents can occur. That ship went aground in a 10.5-mile-wide channel simply because  of the incompetence of those on the bridge. You can have accidents, and you can prevent them. 
   We have a pretty good record here. Between 1971 and 1989, the Department of Transportation tells us there have been seven minor accidents that have occurred involving nuclear waste, but no radioactivity was released at any of the accident sites simply because of the containment of the vehicles that enclose the waste. Those, of course, are the canisters which are built to withstand exposure. Some time ago when we were talking about moving nuclear waste by aircraft, there was the assurance that we have the technology to build a canister that would survive a free-fall from an aircraft at 30,000 feet. 
   As evidence of the thousands of safe used-fuel shipments since 1964, this is the type of cask that is used, and the waste is stored in that. These are required to survive a 30-foot drop onto a flat, unyielding surface, a drop of 40 inches on a steel plate, being engulfed in a 1,475-degree fire for 30 minutes, submersion under 3 feet of water for 8 hours, and on and on. We have taken safeguards to construct these casks in such a way as to ensure there is a minimum of risk associated with transportation. 
   I have been to Great Britain, Sweden, and I have seen in France the manner in which they move high-level waste. They move it by ship, by rail, by road, and they take safeguards to ensure that it is properly contained. 
   We have transportation safety concerns. We have provisions in this bill to deal with them. It involves the Department of Energy developing comprehensive shipping and transportation plans under the same guidelines as we currently move the WIPP. That is the waste isolation project in New Mexico. These are the same guidelines we are going to be using to move this waste. 
   We have been moving waste to New Mexico. That is basically low-level waste. I have been there and been in the salt caverns and observed the process down there. There is great care taken to ensure there is no exposure that cannot be rectified through adequate engineering technology. 
   The used fuel is going to have to travel as designated by the States, they having a determination of what the most appropriate route is. Clearly, the material has to move; otherwise, you cannot get it out of the States--280 sites and 40 States--and you cannot move it to one area that we have predesignated, which is Yucca Mountain in Nevada. 
   Then we are going to have training which would meet Department of Transportation standards so that we have people who are adequately trained to move this waste and cover whatever emergency response readiness is necessary before the shipments begin. 
   So what we have done--perhaps we can do more and perhaps we should and I certainly am open to that--is taken every precaution to try to ensure the exposure is taken out of the process. 
   Let me show you a couple other charts that I think are relevant. For those of you who missed it, this is the location out in the Nevada Test Site that has been chosen to be the permanent repository. This site has been already pretty well bombarded as a consequence of over 50 years and 800 nuclear weapons tests. If you buy the theory that you kind of desecrated one area so maybe that is the best area for a permanent repository, this site should certainly fit. 
   Let me show you one other chart that shows another aspect. As I have indicated earlier, about 20 percent of our energy comes from nuclear power. You see on the chart, shown in red, nuclear power accounts for 18 percent of our energy use in the country. In any event, this chart shows the mix: Coal is 53 percent; nuclear is 18 to 20 percent; natural gas is 14 percent; hydroelectric is 10 percent; other is 2.7 percent; oil is 2 percent; wind is .08 percent; and solar is .02 percent. 
   It is obvious we are going to be dependent on these sources for some time. If we do not address the nuclear waste issue, we are going to pick up 20 percent of our power generation some other way. I think those who are critical of the effort to address our responsibility are a bit irresponsible in not suggesting where we are going to pick up this differential. 
   On this next chart we look at air quality. If we look at our concern over global warming, if we look at our concern over Kyoto, we have to recognize that there is significant avoidance of emissions by the contribution of nuclear power. You can see shown on this chart the regions that were subject to caps from 1990 to 1995 and the emissions avoided by having nuclear generation and where these States would be without it. 
   It is a pretty tough set of facts. The reality is, a good portion of the Northeast corridor would no longer meet its mandate for emission reductions if, indeed, we had to sacrifice the nuclear power industry. 
   Approximately 80 of the 103 currently operating nuclear 
   energy plants are located in or adjacent to areas that are unable to meet the Clean Air Act standards for ozone. Any use of emitting generation in these areas in place of the existing nuclear capacity moves the region further away from attainment of these standards. So I encourage my colleagues from these States to recognize that the nuclear power industry makes a significant contribution, and without it you are going to be looking to some other unidentifiable means to offset the loss of power from the nuclear industry. 
   Let me turn to the substitute that is before us and briefly reflect on where we have been. We have passed bills in this body by a broad bipartisan margin. The last time the vote was 65 to 34--pretty close to overcoming a veto but not quite. 
   I think these bills mark a historic pattern of trying to meet the objectives of the administration through compromise, through changes, and through accommodations. Those bills were a complete substitute for the existing Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 that gave authority to build an interim storage facility for nuclear waste, a temporary above-ground storage pad adjacent to the Yucca Mountain site. It contained extensive provisions on licensing for Yucca Mountain and the interim storage facility, including NEPA radiation protection standards and transportation safety. But the administration was not satisfied. They saw fit to veto the legislation because it opposed the interim storage before the viability assessment was made about the permanent repository. 
   We still think we were doing the responsible thing by trying to address the difficulty of those plants that were about out of license time and would either have to shut down or seek additional relief under State licensing by allowing them to move their waste and store it at Yucca Mountain until such time as a permanent repository was completed. 
   Obviously, there was a fear from Nevada that if that were adopted, the waste would end up in Nevada. Of course, today we are faced with the concerns of various Governors that if we adopt the take-title issue, and title is indeed taken, the waste will go into canisters and be stored onsite in those States, the Government would have title and the waste would still be in the States, that it would not move. 
   The point is that we are either committed as a body to resolve this problem and get on with addressing the transportation of that waste to a permanent repository, or we are going to be faced with the reality that we will simply put it off for another day, put it off for another administration. If we do that, I think we are acting irresponsibly. 
   What we have attempted to do in this bill is a different approach in the manager's amendment. It is not a complete substitute for the old act. It is a minimalist approach. It does not contain an interim storage provision. So we responded to the administration. We responded to the minority. We left that out. We said: It doesn't move until it is licensed. 
   We propose to do two major things. We propose to give the Department of Energy the tools it needs to meet its commitment to move the spent fuel by opening a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain. Secondly, we think it provides fair treatment by permitting utilities to enter into voluntary settlements with those who have fulfilled their end of the bargain by paying over some $15 billion which the ratepayers have paid over the contract. 
   What has the Department of Energy done? It left them holding the bag 
   because the Department of Energy and the administration have not seen fit to lift the terms of the contractual agreement to take the waste. So the manager's amendment to S. 1287 clarifies  the existing unconstitutional White House veto for raising the fee and states that Congress can vote to raise the existing 1 million per kilowatt fee, if necessary, to pay the expenses of the program. It allows plaintiffs in the lawsuits and the DOE to reach voluntary settlements of the Department of Energy's liability for failing to take the waste in 1998. 
   I still have to refer to the example the Federal Government sets when it doesn't honor the sanctity of a contractual commitment. They simply ignore it. They simply ignore the liability of the taxpayer, which, as I have indicated, is something in the area of $40 billion to $80 billion in damages. We, as elected representatives, have an obligation to address and correct that. That is what we are attempting to do in this legislation. 
   Further, it permits the EPA to continue with its rulemaking--and it is the appropriate agency--on radiation standards as long as we have the best science. Where is the best science? As I have indicated, it is in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in consultation with the National Academy of Sciences. That is the best science we have in this country. If that isn't good enough to set a radiation standard, I don't know what is. 
   Obviously, that standard will protect the public health and safety and the environment, but it has to be attainable. If the EPA has a policy of nonattainment that we come up with ultimately, we will waste a lot of time and money, and it will cost the taxpayers a lot of dollars. It will allow fuel to be accepted when the NRC authorizes construction of the permanent repository in the year 2007. Further, it allows the Department of Energy to begin moving fuel as soon as possible after Yucca Mountain is licensed. 
   Transportation provisions are based on those used for the waste isolation plan, as I have indicated. Furthermore, we have moved that fuel in the United States around the world. So S. 1287 builds on existing safe systems by adding money for education, emergency response, local communities, transportation personnel, and provisions for allowing the State to determine the routes and rules for population areas. Who is better qualified than the States? Also, there is advance notification for local government. 
   As I have indicated, we have attempted to compromise, and we continue to try to meet the concerns of the administration and the minority. But in order to do that, we have to agree on our objective, and that is to meet our obligation to address, once and for all, some finality to the nuclear waste storage dilemma. We have eliminated the source of the administration's opposition to our previous bills on interim storage. 
   EPA, secondly, may proceed with its rulemaking. All they have to do--all we want them to do--is be reasonable in the sense of using sound science and participating in peer review with both NRC and the National Academy of Sciences. And in this existing proposal, we have allowed the utilities to enter into a voluntary settlement with the DOE. This was the idea of Secretary Richardson. 
   The manager's amendment to S. 1287 gives us an opportunity, I think, for a triumph of substance over process, safety of people over politics. As I have indicated, the Senate has twice 
   passed this legislation by large, bipartisan margins. 
   Where does the administration stand on this? Well, I have a letter from the administration called ``statement of policy.'' I think it should be ``statement of administrative mixed policy.'' It states that the administration has reviewed the February 4 manager's amendment and they find it unacceptable. Although the amendment appears to allow the EPA to exercise its existing authority, they still believe it would allow another entity to block EPA's authority. I don't know whether they have read the bill or not, but that isn't what the bill says. Consequently, one can only assume the administration is opposed to it because it always has been, regardless of what we have attempted to compromise. Furthermore, I think it is appropriate to recognize that. 
   Again, the administration seems to be working to create a problem that really we can address. The rationale is, I assume, only that they could object to the legislation. That really isn't an adequate excuse. I encourage my friends who have the same responsibility as I do to recognize that the administration has an obligation to come forward and say how we can meet this obligation collectively, the Congress and the administration. 
   The administration, as I indicated, basically objects to a provision that requires EPA to consult with scientists before adopting a standard. What is wrong with the best science? The administration talks about good science and making decisions based on sound science. In fact, the administration's position on science is that it is good. But I wonder if it is good only when it supports a predetermined policy decision. 
   That is kind of where I think we are. I think that is unreasonable. I think that is irresponsible. I think it deserves a greater explanation than the one offered. The only reason for the administration to object to having EPA consult with scientists at the National Academy of Sciences, or with the participation of the NRC, is that they know it is possible to adopt a reasonable standard but they simply don't want to do it. I have a hard time with that because I think that in itself is somewhat irresponsible. 
   I have some other examples that concern me. I will not take the time now, but maybe I will later. The EPA is an extraordinary agency. They carry a big responsibility, but one questions the balance they use. I am going to cite a couple of instances with which I have had personal experience, and I invite my colleagues to share those. As we question the legitimate authority of the EPA, which is statute--that is in law--EPA does have authority for final rulemaking; we just want them to use the best science available. 
   In my hometown of Fairbanks, it snows. With snow, you have one of two options: You either leave it there or you move it. Several years ago, they had a heavy snowfall where the city and school buses park. This was a paved lot. They moved the snow off the lot. The buses cooperated and they put it on the back lot, which was determined by EPA to be a wetlands. Well, the EPA notified the city of a violation of the wetlands permit. Now, there was snow that came naturally on that other lot where they pushed the snow. It makes no sense. The snow was frozen water. How can wetlands be damaged by more snow? I don't know. 
   We had a problem in Anchorage, AK. This was a storm water treatment: when it rains, the rain goes off the highway into the gutters. In the particular community of Anchorage, it was charged into Cook Inlet; this is water off the streets. Cook Inlet has some of the highest tides in the world, next to the Bay of Fundy, nearly 30 feet, almost twice a day. 
   However, EPA Clean Water Act regulations interpreted that the city was in violation because it had to remove 30 percent of the organic matter from the untreated water. The problem was it was rain water. There was no organic matter to remove. Yet they were still in violation. But the water was too clean to begin with. The city appealed to the EPA. The EPA denied the appeal and told the city they were subject to a fine. One of the city council members suggested they go down to the fish plant and add some fish guts to the drain water so there would be some organic matter to remove and thus meet the national discharge standard. This got notoriety all over the country. It made no sense to pay to contaminate pure rain water and then pay to remove the contamination. We were finally able to convince them as a consequence of public opinion and public notoriety of the impracticality of EPA. 
   In this instance, I have one more little item that I will share with you. In 1993, the EPA proposed to take pepper spray bear repellent off the market until its safety could be certified. The spray was at that time the only effective nonlethal repellent that Alaskans could use to protect themselves against bears. I say nonlethal. You can take a gun or you can take some pepper spray. While the EPA reconsidered the decision and allowed the pepper spray repellent to remain while it permitted a speeded up regulatory review, the preliminary decision to recall the spray was idiotic, to say the least. Alaskans or anyone who wants to can put cayenne pepper in their chili. They could  legally throw the pepper at a charging bear, if they wanted to. It was insane to say that could not be placed within the spray can; namely, the chili spray. 
   What was really insane was that EPA initially argued they couldn't speed up registration of the pepper spray until it was field tested and on, do you know what? Wild bears--a difficult and rather dangerous thing to do. It was especially odd that the bear undoubtedly would much rather be sprayed by the pepper spray than the alternative 30.06 bullet. 
   I have recycling asthma inhalant examples, vehicle gasoline rules, ozone standards, background contamination on MTBE, battery enterprise examples, mining examples, and recycling center examples. 
   I am not going to bore my colleagues with that other than to say what we want is the best science. We want EPA to take advantage of that science and then come down with their rulemaking. But very particularly, we don't want EPA to set an attainment standard that is unattainable for the nuclear waste to be disposed of. 
   I know my friends want to be heard from, and there will be amendments forthcoming. But I want to conclude with a reference on what we can do. 
   Again, I point out that it is the obligation of the Government--that includes those of us in the Congress and the administration--to solve this problem. This bill is the congressional solution, and the administration has an obligation as well. 
   We voted out this legislation in the last two Congresses by bipartisan votes--65 to 34 in the Senate, and in the House of Representatives 307 to 120--again, not enough to override a veto. 
   This year, we introduced the interim storage legislation, S. 608. The legislation had votes to be favorably reported. I proposed that the committee consider a new approach to 
   accommodate the Secretary and the administration. We hoped to find a solution to the nuclear waste dilemma to gain full consensus and avoid procedural problems of the past. Senate bill 1287 was approved in the committee by a bipartisan vote of 14-6. 
   Here are the five essential points that I believe have to be addressed if we are going to have anything meaningful when we are through. 
   We need congressional approval before there is any increase in the nuclear waste figure. We simply cannot give the executive branch carte blanche. It has to have congressional approval; second, authorize settlement of lawsuits for DOE's failure to perform; third, the radiation protection standards, as I stated, for the repository to be set by the agencies that have the expertise--the NRC, National Academy of Sciences working with the EPA. 
   I compromised on this point in my manager's amendment. The EPA may now go ahead with its standard-setting regulations provided that they take advantage of the best science available, and that the NRC in consultation with the National Academy of Sciences and the EPA agree that the standard is attainable. 
   Some suggest that the EPA cannot have the last word. That is not the intent. If we have to rephrase it, we will do it. The intent is authority by statute to belong to the EPA, but clearly the best science should include input from the National Academy of Sciences and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
   The fourth prerequisite: Operation of a repository fuel acceptance facility key to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission authorization for the permanent repository in the year 2007, and a transportation system based on the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant model, which is WIPP. 
   Those are the five principles that we outlined. Those are the principles that we worked on with the minority to try to achieve a consensus. 
   I think the bill reflects significant concession by the supporters of the past legislation. I believe this new approach still gives the DOE the tools it needs. I still don't know why the administration seems so possessed, policy-wise, to oppose it. But that is what we have before us. 
   I conclude this portion of my statement by again identifying where I think we are in the differences we have. That, again, is the radiation standard. 
   As you heard me state time and time again, I think the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is the appropriate determiner of that standard. But the manager's amendment now contains new language that would permit the EPA to go ahead as long as the National Academy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission are consulted. Obviously, that interest is a science that will protect health, safety, and welfare. As to the objective, it is most important that we have an objective of achieving the radiation standard that is attainable. 
   This is a reasonable approach. It provides the best science after peer review. Yet it does allow EPA to ultimately complete the rule after we have had the input of the best minds on the subject and have consulted with one another. 
   If the EPA and the NRC cannot agree, then the EPA is not permitted, obviously, to adopt any rule until after June 1, 2001. But after June 1, 2001, the EPA may go ahead and adopt a rule pursuant to existing authority under section 801 of the Energy Policy Act. 
   Part of the problem with the EPA standard that was detailed in the proposed rules that came out last August was that it applied unrealistic standards to ground water. They proposed 4 millirems for ground water. This is a standard that comes from the Safe Drinking Water Act, which I support. 
   This chart shows the levels of radiation. For those working in the Capitol, we get 80 millirems; anyone living in a brick house, 70 millirems; annual exposure from cosmic radiation, 53 millirems; annual average radiation from the ground, 26 millirems; x ray, 20 millirems; dental x ray, 14 millirems; round-trip flight from New York to Los Angeles, 6 millirems; exposure from a transport container carrying high level waste 6 feet away, 5 millirems. But the EPA proposal is 4 millirems for the drinking water standard. 
   This chart shows the proposed site: 800 nuclear weapon tests over 50 years. They are going to come down and propose a 5 millirem level; remember, 4 millirems is the level for drinking water. 
   Is that really in the interests of proceeding with this legislation or is it to set an unattainable standard? No one will drink the ground water that comes from this site. I hope not. 
   The Safe Drinking Water Act should not be applied to ground water. However, if the water becomes tap water, the act should apply; but not while the water is in the ground. The EPA wants to take extremely low standards that were designed to apply to drinking water out of a tap and apply to water in the ground, whether people drink it or not. 
   Let me be very clear. This dispute has nothing to do with a level of protection for the people in Nevada. Whether or not the drinking water standard is applied to ground water has nothing to do with how much additional radiation, if any, Nevadans would be exposed to from the facility. The EPA applied similar regulations to the WIPP Transuranic Nuclear Waste Disposal Facility in New Mexico. The drinking water standard was not an issue when WIPP was licensed by EPA because WIPP is a salt mine. Obviously, there is no potable water around it. Maybe EPA thinks all nuclear waste should be disposed of in a salt cavity, but I am not sure everybody in the country or in this body would agree. 
   The National Academy of Sciences did not recommend that the Safe Drinking Water Act be applied to ground water. Instead, they addressed ``requirements necessary to limit risks to individuals'' as required by law. In fact, the National Academy specifically said they don't make such a recommendation. 
   Finally, the National Academy concluded that the decision regarding the acceptable level of risk for Yucca Mountain is a policy decision. What does that mean? That means a decision for Congress, not the scientists. In our legislation, we propose the best scientists come up with a recommendation to EPA and EPA be part of that process. I think it is appropriate that Congress make a decision regarding the level of risk. 
   Finally, the ultimate myth. I think everyone would agree, this administration says it cares about clean air and preventing climate change. Here is where our electricity comes from: 53 percent comes from coal; 18 to 20 percent is nuclear; 14 percent is natural  gas; 10 percent is hydroelectricity; the remaining few percent is oil, wind, and solar. 
   DOE's Energy Information Administration says the Kyoto treaty would require a 30-percent reduction of CO2 emissions 
   from the predicted 2010 level. 
   How do we do this without nuclear power? We cannot get there from here. There are no nuclear emission-free sources that can economically take its place. For the moment, forget about the Kyoto treaty and think of the present. 
   This chart shows the emissions avoided from increased nuclear generation. This is a reduction in SO2 from nuclear power generation. From 1990 to 1995, 37 percent of the sulfur dioxide reductions required by the Clean Air Act came from increased generation from existing nuclear powerplants. That is where it came from. These were sulfide reductions. 
   Is that not ironic? They gave credit for the reductions to the nuclear plants. They don't have any emissions. That is where they get the reductions. Clever. Even with nuclear power, it is difficult and expensive to meet the new regs; without nuclear power it is impossible. 
   As this body addresses the broad obligation of reality, we have to focus in on the difficulty we have. That is, that the nuclear industry is choking on its own waste. We have the responsibility to come up with a solution. 
   This chart shows an overlay of nuclear plants in noncontainment areas. In fact, almost all nuclear plants are located in or near areas that have significant air quality problems. What happens when the nonemitting sources are replaced with emitting sources--the only realistic alternatives? 
   EPA can pass all the regulations in the world, but if the President and Vice President really did care about clean air, they would get behind this bill. This contributes more to clean air than any possible thing we could do in the area of increasing dependence on hydrocarbons. 
   The administration has a policy: Delay and more delay, for the American people who care for their safety, their environment, and their pocketbook. Let's look at the pocketbook. The litigation goes on. The $15 billion has been paid by the ratepayers. The liability associated with nonperformance to the contractual commitment, $40 to $80 billion, or $1,400 per family. 
   Is the President concerned about clean air, about climate change or is this some kind of a cynical diplomatic/political exercise? I don't know. Previously, the administration said it objected to siting a temporary storage facility before 1998 when the viability assessment for Yucca Mountain would be completed. At that time, I said anyone who believes that the availability of the viability assessment will make passing legislation easier is out of touch with reality. I take no pleasure in the fact that I was right. The reality is no one wants nuclear waste stored in their State. I am sensitive to that. I understand the position of my Nevada friends. However, we have it in 40 States. Do we want to leave it there or put it in one area that has been determined to carry a repository for our high level waste? 
   At the committee hearing on S. 1287 in February, all four members of the Nevada delegation stated that no level of scientific proof would lessen their objection to this project. Let me repeat that: All four members of the Nevada delegation stated that no level of scientific proof would lessen their opposition to this project. I understand that and I accept that. It doesn't make any difference what level of scientific proof is available, they are going to oppose it. A further reality is that this administration apparently will not support a solution to this problem as long as the Nevada delegation opposes it. I can understand that. 
   Let's call the shots as they really are. The ultimate reality is that the Federal Government had an obligation to start taking the waste in 1998 and it violated the sanctity of the contract. We have reached a crossroad. The job of fixing this program is ours. Time for fixing the program is now. Much progress has been made at Yucca. Much money has been spent at Yucca. We can build on this progress. 
   The bill contains the tools that the Department of Energy needs to make the permanent repository work. Every day we wait to move the fuel, the liability of the American taxpayer increases. We can choose whether the Nation needs 80 various storage sites in 40 States or just one: the arid, remote, Nevada Test Site where we exploded scores of nuclear bombs during the cold war. 
   Is that not the most safe and most remote location for nuclear waste storage? Over 800 nuclear tests were conducted at this site. 
   Mr. President, the time clearly is now. I note my colleagues from Nevada are on the floor seeking recognition. I have taken a good deal of time and look forward to their statement. I am happy to respond, I might add, to any questions they may pose. Obviously, we are going to be on this for some time. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I just listened to the statement of my good friend from Nevada. I thought perhaps I could contribute something meaningful to our consideration by trying to explain some of the procedure that we have run into and the rationale behind the process. 
   As the Senator from Nevada indicated, last Friday we were able to supply the amendment which was acknowledged by the minority. In my numerous conversations with the minority and the ranking member of the committee, it became necessary to consider making changes. We have been in constant consultation with the ranking member and professional staff to try to see if we could reach an accommodation on the suggested changes that have been primarily communicated to us by the Senator from New Mexico. 
   It was not the intention to do an end run, by any means, on my good friends from Nevada. But it was an effort to try to advance, if you will, the continuing negotiations. That situation has been changing. In my opinion, the goalposts have been moved a little bit, but I am not going to argue the merits of that. 
   We have been talking about various aspects. I think it is a fair characterization by my friend from Nevada to say that if you do not know who you are fighting, it is pretty hard to know what the rules are--or words to that effect. 
   We have to file the amendments prior to 6 o'clock. There obviously is going to be one more chapter and verse to this. I assume the two Senators from Nevada are conversing with the minority and are a part of this process. 
   But, in any event, that is the best explanation I can offer as to why this thing has not remained somewhat stationary but has been moving, as we have tried to accommodate certain concerns that have been brought up, many of which have been quite germane and appropriate.  
   One of the things that I think we should identify is something that I had been under the impression the Secretary of Energy was addressing; that was the concern of a number of Governors. I will read the names of those Governors. They include Governor Jeb Bush of Florida; Governor Howard Dean of Vermont; Governor Angus King, an independent, from Maine; Governor John Kitzhaber of Oregon; Governor Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire; Governor Jesse Ventura of Minnesota; and Governor Tom Vilsack of Iowa. Let me share with my friends what those Governors have said:  
   We Governors from states hosting commercial nuclear power plants and from affected states express our opposition to the plan proposed by Energy Secretary Richardson in his February 1999 testimony before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee. Secretary Richardson proposes that the Department of Energy take title, assume management responsibility, and pay costs at nuclear plant sites for used nuclear fuel it was legally and contractually obliged to begin removing in January 1998. This proposed plan would create semipermanent, federally controlled, used nuclear fuel facilities in each of our States.  
   I think it is rather ironic that the whole argument we previously had the last time we took up this legislation was whether or not to site a temporary repository in Nevada. The fear of the Nevadans is, if we started to move this waste out there, Nevada would be the proclaimed site for the waste because it had already moved out there, even though the process of licensing was to continue. Here we have the States expressing the same concern Nevada had when the Nevadans argued against putting a temporary repository in their State and shipping the fuel out before Yucca Mountain was licensed. 
   Here are the Governors saying:  
   This proposed plan would create semi-permanent, federally controlled, used nuclear fuel facilities in each of our States.  
   They have the same fear. The fear is that if the Government takes title, the waste will sit there in their States. Now, there is some rationale in that fear because the Government certainly hasn't been upfront in addressing its responsibility, in contractual terms, to take the waste in 1998. It seems as if the Government is prepared to leave the waste wherever it might be rather than accept it. That is the only conclusion you can come to, as evidenced by the reluctance to take it in 1998, the reluctance to support previous legislation that would put that waste in a temporary repository at Yucca Mountain until Yucca Mountain was determined to be licensed. So now the fear is that these States are going to be stuck with that waste because the Federal Government is going to take control of it in their State, and it will sit there. 
   Let me cite the specific reasons for the opposition of these Governors. Again, they are Jeb Bush, Republican from Florida; Howard Dean, Democrat from Vermont; Angus King, Independent from Maine; John Kitzhaber, Democrat from Oregon; Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat from New Hampshire; Jesse Ventura, the Reform Governor from Minnesota; Tom Vilsack, Democrat from Iowa. That is a pretty broad bipartisan group. In the letter, it says:  
   Specific reasons for our opposition are: 
   The plan proposes to use our electric consumer monies which were paid to the Federal Government for creating a final disposal repository for used nuclear fuel. Such funds cannot [in their opinion] legally be used for any other purpose than a Federal repository.  
   Well, if that is correct, then that is correct, they can't be used to store the fuel in those States next to the reactors. 
   Further, it states:  
   This plan abridges States' rights.......  
   I think we need to hear a little bit more about States' rights around here.  
   [I]t constitutes Federal takings and establishes new nuclear waste facilities outside of State authority and control.  
   Yet within their very States.  
   These new Federal nuclear waste facilities would be on river fronts, lakes and seashores [where the plants are] which would never be chosen for permanent disposal of used nuclear fuel and in a site selection process. 
   The plan constitutes a major Federal action--  
   I think it does--  
   which has not gone through the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review process.  
   So the administration is circumventing NEPA. 
   Further:  
   The new waste facilities would likely become de facto permanent [waste] disposal sites.  
   This is the crux of it, Mr. President. They say:  
   Federal action over the last 50 years has not been able to solve the political problems associated with developing disposal for used nuclear fuel. Establishing these Federal sites will remove the political motivation to complete a final disposal site.  
   The letter to the President concludes with:  
   We urge you to retract Secretary Richardson's proposed plan and instead support establishing centralized interim storage at an appropriate site. This concept has strong, bipartisan support and results in the environmentally preferable, least-cost solution to the used nuclear fuel dilemma.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the students of the University of Alaska-Fairbanks, School of Management, Student Investment Fund, who have invested an original stake of $100,000 into stocks and CDs and now have a portfolio valued at over half a million dollars. 
   With the money earned while learning, the students participating in the Fund have donated $8,000 in scholarships to UAF students. They have created two scholarship funds, the Michael L. Rice Scholarship and the Vanna K. Husby Scholarship, which are awarded to students who are in the School of Management and are enrolled in the Student Investment Fund for the following academic year. They have also donated $4,000 to the UAF National Merit Scholarship to encourage talented students to attend the University of Alaska-Fairbanks. 
   The class began in 1991, when then Chancellor O'Rourke transferred $100,000 of University endowment money into the Student Investment Fund at Dean Witter. The account has been wholly managed by the students since its inception. Only during the first year of the fund did it fall below a value of $100,000. It has grown every year since and has a return of 71 percent. 
   This class and its philanthropy are wonderful examples of how higher education can benefit not only students, but the entire community.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the legislation before the Senate will extend the provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands for 1 year after the date of enactment of the legislation. 
   To minimize adverse effects on the local economy, a number of transition provisions have been incorporated in the legislation, including funding for technical assistance to diversify and strengthen the local economy of those islands. The transition period will end December 31, 2009, but the special provisions for employment--employment-based visas--may be extended for legitimate businesses in the tourism industry for not to exceed two 5-year periods and for a single 5-year period for other legitimate business. 
   I think it is reasonable to question how this situation arose. The Marianas was one district of the old United States Nation's Trust Territory of the Pacific islands, and the United States was the administrating authority. The residents of the Marianas wanted them to become a U.S. territory and obtain local government and U.S. citizenship similar to the neighboring island of Guam. Guam is the southern most of the Mariana Islands and was acquired from Spain back in 1898. The United States and local officials in the Marianas negotiated a covenant to establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in political union with the United States. That included all the islands, with the exception of Guam; specifically, Saipan, Tinian, and Rota. 
   That covenant was approved overwhelmingly in a local United Nations-observed plebiscite and then by this Congress in 1976. The early negotiations assumed the trusteeship would terminate for the Marianas. The agreement was approved and assumed the full extension of Federal immigration laws at the same time the United States sovereignty was extended to the area. When negotiations on other portions of the trust territory stalled and the United States decided not to seek piecemeal termination of the trusteeship, the Marianas justifiably wanted as much of the covenant implemented under the trusteeship as possible. The agreement was to implement these provisions of the covenant that were consistent with the continued status of the area under the trusteeship and defer those provisions that were tied to U.S. sovereignty. One of these provisions was Federal immigration law. That is what we are dealing with today. 
   It was abundantly clear the United States could extend those laws as soon as the trusteeship was terminated. The report accompanying the joint resolution of approval noted only that we hoped we could include an ``adequate protective provision'' to deal with the concern in the Marianas that their islands could be overrun with immigration. 
   Had we acted in 1986 to extend Federal immigration laws, we wouldn't be here today. The Marianas economy would not be so captive to the use of temporary contract workers and many of the abuses of workers would not have occurred. On the other hand, the level of prosperity on the islands might not be the same. 
   What has happened in the Marianas? When the covenant was negotiated, all parties assumed economic development would occur around tourism and anticipated Department of Defense basing in Tinian and Saipan. That followed the pattern in Guam. Tourism did develop; the military activities did not. 
   Others, however, noticed the unique combination of authorities and moved in to try and take advantage. Because the Marianas had control of immigration, it could set its own 
   minimum  wage and had the ability to import goods into the U.S. Customs territory without duty and labeled that it had been made in the United States, foreign garment operations--especially those from China--sought to locate in the Marianas. 
   The difficulty of a small island population trying to effectively administer a comprehensive immigration system also led to other abuses in those taking advantage of the situation. Exploiters induced people in Bangladesh to pay enormous amounts of money to go to the Marianas where there were jobs. Other aliens arrived; some of them were not paid. Many alien workers were abused. The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources heard testimony from a young lady who had been brought to Saipan as a minor, forced to perform in a club, and was used for prostitution. The Federal Government has brought a prosecution in that instance on several counts, including trafficking in human beings. This was occurring under the U.S. flag, and supposedly with the protections all U.S. citizens enjoy under our Constitution. 
   I have a series of charts I will discuss in detail but in deference to my good friend, Senator BINGAMAN from New Mexico, the ranking member of the committee, I defer to him, and then perhaps he can defer back to me. I yield to my good friend and ranking member from New Mexico, Senator BINGAMAN.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague, the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the Senator from New Mexico, for his comments and for his support. 
   This legislation was reported unanimously by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. S. 1052, as reported by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, will extend the provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands one year after the date of enactment of the legislation. To minimize adverse effects on the local economy, a number of transition provisions have been incorporated in the legislation. The transition period will end on December 31, 2009, but the special provisions for employment based visas may be extended for legitimate businesses in the tourism industry for not to exceed two five-year periods and for a single five-year period for other legitimate businesses. 
   This legislation is the result of several years work by the Committee, including a visit that I made to the Northern Marianas in February 1996. I was accompanied by Senator AKAKA, who has cosponsored this legislation and was also a cosponsor of legislation that I introduced in the last Congress. This is bipartisan legislation that is long overdue. The administration would prefer a far more draconian approach with a minimum of transition and little economic or training assistance to the Northern Marianas. The Marianas, on the other hand, would prefer that we did nothing. I don't think that either approach is responsible. 
   There are legitimate concerns by some in the Northern Marianas over what the effect of this legislation may be. We have tried to address those concerns, as I will describe later. For example, one of the ways that the Northern Marianas has tried to deal with the concern over alien workers remaining for indefinite periods without any political rights is to limit the time that any worker can remain in the Marianas. One effect of that approach, however, is to frustrate the ability of employers to recruit, train, and hire personnel. From experience, I can testify that the last thing any employer wants to do is commit resources to training individuals only to have them leave for other employment. It is far worse when the government says that your most valuable employees must not only leave your employ, but must also leave the country. Lynn Knight, the new president of the Saipan Chamber of Commerce, noted that she had one employee who had been with her firm for several years and would have to leave. Another skilled professional could remain since he was a U.S. citizen. Similar situations are likely in other businesses, and I would expect especially in the tourism industry. To deal with that problem, the committee has included a special provision (the new section 6(j) to the Covenant Act) that provides a one-time grandfather provision for long-term employees in legitimate businesses. The provision would allow employers to sponsor current employees who had been employed for five years. If the alien is otherwise eligible for admission to the United States, that employee may be granted an immigrant visa or have his status adjusted to a person lawfully admitted for permanent residence without regard to any numerical limitations in the Immigration Act. 
   I mention this one provision to illustrate that the committee has tried its best to deal with any legitimate concerns with the legislation and, as in  the case of Ms. Knight, problems with the current local laws. Unfortunately, obtaining specific comments and recommendations has not been the easiest task before the committee. While the Governor has been forthright, the tactics taken by others has been more to obstruct the legislation than to provide useful comments and suggestions. The Governor has lowered the tone of the debate on this issue, although his example has not been followed by others. 
   I would refer my colleagues to the report of the committee on this legislation for a detailed history on how we arrived at this situation where the United States does not control the terms of entry to its shores, what that exemption turned into, and how we have dealt with legitimate concerns about the long overdue extension of federal legislation. 
   In brief, however, in 1976, Congress approved a Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States (PL 94-241). The Covenant formed the basis for the termination of the United Nations Trusteeship with respect to the Northern Mariana Islands. Termination occurred in 1986 for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and for the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. Prior to termination, those provisions of the Covenant that were consistent with continued status of the area as part of the Trust Territory were made applicable by the U.S. as Administering Authority. Other provisions (such as the extension of U.S. sovereignty) were not made applicable. Among those laws was the Immigration Act. Had the United States sought 
   piece-meal termination of the trusteeship, as some advocated at the time, or if agreement with the other districts had not proved so elusive, the immigration laws of the United States would have been extended to the Northern Marianas as they applied to Guam. We would not be here today. 
   The Covenant permitted a unique system in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands under which the local government controlled immigration and minimum wage levels and also had the benefit of duty and quota free entry of manufactured goods under the provisions of General Note 3(a) of the Harmonized Tariff Schedules. My colleagues should be aware that these provisions are not subject to mutual consent and can be modified or repealed by the Congress. The section-by-section analysis of the committee report on the Covenant provides in part:  
   SECTION 503.--This section deals with certain laws of the United States which are not now applicable to the Northern Mariana Islands and provides that they will remain inapplicable except in the manner and to the extent that they are made applicable by specific legislation enacted after the termination of the Trusteeship. These laws are: 
   The Immigration and Naturalization Laws (subsection (a)). The reason this provision is included is to cope with the problems which unrestricted immigration may impose upon small island communities. Congress is aware of those problems. ..... It may well be that these problems will have been solved by the time of the termination of the Trusteeship Agreement and that the Immigration and Nationality Act containing adequate protective provisions can then be introduced to the Northern Mariana Islands. .....  
   Until termination of the trusteeship, the United States possessed and exercised plenary power, including control over entry into the area. The committee anticipated that by the termination of the Trusteeship, the federal government would have found some way of preventing a large influx of persons into the Marianas, recognizing the constitutional limitations on restrictions on travel, and that we would extend federal immigration laws when we extended United States sovereignty over the area. We neglected to do so. 
   Upon termination of the trusteeship, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands became a territory of the United States and its residents became United States citizens. What transpired thereafter, however, was precisely what we sought to prevent. Because we had not enacted legislation extending federal immigration laws, however, persons were free to enter the Northern Marianas under local law. Although the population of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands was only 15,000 people in 1976 when the Covenant was approved, the population (July, 1999) is now estimated at 79,429. The rapid increase in population coincides with the assumption of immigration control by the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. According to the most recent statistical survey by the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, in 1980, 78 percent of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands population were U.S. citizens. That figure had declined to less than 47 percent by 1990 and by 1991, the percentage on Saipan, where most of the population resides, the figure was 42 percent. 
   The majority of the population resides on Saipan, which is the economic and government center of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The most recent statistics (March 1999) from the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands estimate the population of Saipan at 71,790. U.S. citizens are estimated at 30,154 of whom 24,710 are Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands born. There are 41,636 aliens of whom about 4,000 are from the freely associated states. By contrast, in 1980, non-U.S. citizen residents for the entire Northern Marianas totaled only 3,753 of whom 1,593 were citizens of the freely associated states and only 2,160 came from outside Micronesia. There is also a significant population of illegal aliens with estimates ranging from 3,000 to as high as 7,000 illegal aliens. 
   Whatever the number, with the exception of those from Micronesia, none of these almost 40,000 persons entered under United States law and none has any of the rights of persons who legally enter the United 
   States to work or reside. 
   Repeated allegations of violations of applicable federal laws relating to worker health and safety, concerns with respect to immigration problems, including the admission of undesirable aliens, and reports of worker abuse, especially in the domestic and garment worker sectors, led to the inclusion of a $7 million set aside in appropriations in 1994 to support federal agency presence in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and increased enforcement of federal laws. 
   During the 104th Congress, the Senate passed S. 638, legislation reported by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and supported by the administration. Concern over the effectiveness of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands immigration laws and reports of the entry of organized criminal elements from Japan and China led the committee to include a provision to require the Commonwealth ``to cooperate in the identification and, if necessary, exclusion or deportation from the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands of persons who represent security or law enforcement risks to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or the United States.'' (Sec. 4 of S. 638) No action was taken by the House. 
   In February, 1996, I visited the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands with Senator AKAKA and met with local and federal officials. In addition, we inspected a garment factory and met with Bangladeshi security guards who had not been paid and who were living in substandard conditions. As a result of the meetings and continued expressions of concern over conditions, the committee held an oversight hearing on June 26, 1996. We were assured that conditions would improve.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a very dear friend of mine who was in the Alaska Airlines plane that had the tragic accident yesterday afternoon off the coast of California near Los Angeles. 
   Morrie Thompson and I go back a long way, all the way to Fairbanks, AK, when I first became involved in banking activities in that community. He was a young Native leader. The paths that we took after that time in the early 1970s resulted in numerous meetings and conversations. His temperament and sensitivity to the advancement of the Native people of Alaska are almost as though he came on the scene to be a man of his time. I speak about that in reference to the significant portion of our aboriginal community, our Alaskan Natives, people who were in a transition from a subsistence, nomadic lifestyle into contemporary competition for education, competition for jobs, competition for development. 
   Morrie and his companion, Thelma, not only were good friends, but the contribution they made to the community of Alaska as a whole, Native and non-Native alike, was a powerful one. What they leave is a legacy that we can all share with pride and a sense of a job well done by Morrie and Thelma, because what they have left in the formation of the Alaska Native community is a structure where our Native people have an ownership, not only in the village corporations, but the regional corporations from which their traditional geographic association springs and their well being can be secured. 
   As a consequence of that, if you look at the Native American on the reservation systems throughout the United States and see the comparison with the advancement of the settlement in Alaska, the results speak for themselves--due, in no small measure, to the guidance of Morrie Thompson. 
   He and I served together when I was running a financial institution in Alaska. We had a large number of branches in smaller communities: Barrow, Tok, Nenana, Koyukuk, Nome. As president of that organization, I found the advice and counsel of Morrie Thompson most valuable as we addressed our responsibility in meeting the needs of Alaska's developing Native community. 
   A few months ago, Morrie Thompson announced he intended to step down as chairman and chief executive officer of the Doyon Corporation, the regional Native corporation. There was a retirement party for Morrie. There was a great tribute paid to him by the men and women who knew him, loved him, and worked with him. A very substantial fund was established in his name for the benefit of young Native Alaskans. 
   I think that area, young Native Alaskans, is where the real tribute to Morrie Thompson belongs because he encouraged involvement and education to maintain the attributes of our Native people allowing them to be competitive in job markets and educational opportunities. 
   As a consequence of the terrible tragedy that took his life and that of his wife and daughter--he leaves two other daughters and he leaves grandchildren--he leaves a legacy for all of us to reflect on: a legacy of leadership, a legacy of inspiration, a legacy of genuine trust. 
   He was probably one of the nicest and most decent men I have ever met. As we note the passing of Morrie Thompson, I say to his family and friends, he will be deeply missed, but his legacy and contribution will live in Alaska.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to reflect a little bit on what is happening in our Nation. We got a little snow outside. Snow is not unknown to me or the State I represent. It is part of our livelihood. We live with the cold weather. We 
   know how to handle it. 
   But there is suddenly a great concern among a number of my colleagues and their constituents about the high price of heating and transportation fuels in the country, particularly in the northeastern part of the Nation. This morning in New Hampshire they said it was cold and clear. People were out to vote, but they were worried about the price of heating oil. I would like to discuss for a moment why some of these price increases are occurring, as well as appropriate and perhaps inappropriate ways we could respond. 
   In mid-January, spot prices for heating oil spiked by about 50 cents. At one point, they closed at $1.36 per gallon. Gulf coast prices spiked, but they were pulled up, to a large degree, by the spike in New York State. One of the first places where consumers felt the impact was in home heating oil prices where, on January 21, they were up anywhere from 35 cents to 60 cents per gallon in the Northeast over the prior week. This was also felt in diesel prices, which have also risen dramatically. This is causing our trucking industry to seriously consider steep price increases, or even parking some of their trucks for a while. 
   If you have not bought an airplane ticket this month, you should try it because you will find there is a $20 surcharge added to your ticket. This is to offset the increased costs of fuel oil. You cannot run these aircraft on hot air. You run them on kerosene. 
   What is the cause of this price increase? For the most part, there are short-term causes that have so dramatically impacted the price in the Northeast, but there are also long-term issues that have impacted and will continue to impact the Nation. 
   If we are looking at a quick fix, we can do that or we can look at the long run and figure out how we are going to take care of this problem. 
   The short term problems include the combination of relatively low stocks of inventory, forecasts for colder than normal weather through early February, some barges being delayed because of storms, and some unexpected refinery problems. 
   Additionally, we have refineries that were in transition. We have not built any new refineries in this country for a couple of decades for a very good reason: Nobody wants to invest in them because of the concern over the environmental consequences, the Superfund exposure, and so forth. 
   Here we are, on the one hand, with an increasing demand for petroleum products, but because of the laws that were made by Congress which are so draconian, the investment community is reluctant to put in new, efficient refineries. 
   As a consequence of the low stocks, the existing refiners are scurrying to locate immediate supplies, a number of utilities are chasing the limited supply, and we have a peaking cold weather demand. As you walk home tonight you will feel it. In short, it was a basic  problem of too much demand chasing too little supply. 
   There is some relief in that the New York spot distillate problem appears to be easing because the current refinery capacity currently is adequate to meet the needs, but there is going to be some delay in getting the supply delivered. Additionally, The good news about the high prices is that it usually speeds the arrival of product from someplace else. Indeed, it has been reported that at least a dozen tankers full of heating oil are on their way from Europe heading to the East Coast right now. There is an indication that as a result of this the price has dropped in the last few days. 
   Unfortunately, even when this immediate problem is resolved, it is possible recurrences will happen as stocks are likely to stay low for the remainder of the winter. 
   According to the Energy Information Agency, the EIA, ``the low-stock situation is worldwide and is not necessarily limited to distillate. It stems directly from what is happening in the crude oil markets.'' That is what we have to look toward. A continuing crude oil supply shortage is driving crude prices up, causing refiners worldwide to draw down stocks as the higher crude price squeeze margins. 
   What is happening in those crude markets? If one looks at the worldwide crude market, it is evident there has been more petroleum demand than supply, requiring the use of stocks to meet petroleum demands. 
   Following the extremely low prices at the beginning of 1999, OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, as well as Mexico, agreed to remove about 6 percent of the world's production from the market in order to work off excess inventories. And what else? To bring prices back. And they have been successful. 
   Remarkably, the producing countries have shown strong discipline in adhering to these quotas. This has caused worldwide stocks, including those in the U.S., to be drawn down at very low levels. In particular, refiners drew stocks down in the fall rather than build them up for the winter. 
   We are now in the middle of that winter, the usual high point of world demand, and we have low stocks. On top of this, OPEC members have been indicating that they will maintain their production cutbacks at least through March and possibly June, so there is no panacea here. The news, along with the cold weather, increased demand in Asia due to a faster than expected recovery of the Asian economy is behind the current crude surge which pushed west Texas intermediate crude past $30 a barrel briefly in January. 
   There is a response to this. One I think is inappropriate and the other is appropriate. Let's look at the first one: How should we react. 
   A number of my colleagues and some senior members of the administration have made suggestions about how we should react to this. The first suggestion made by some of my colleagues is let's release the oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or SPR, to combat the high price of crude. This is the reserve we have in the salt caverns in the southern part of Louisiana and other areas. That oil is there for the national and energy security of the country in case there is an emergency. 
   I believe such a decision to sell that oil would be disastrous from the standpoint of both national and security policy. Our Government has never tapped SPR to manipulate crude prices, and I do not think they should do so now. It is fair to say the administration tapped SPR to meet some of their budget requirements, but to manipulate crude prices is totally inappropriate. 
   SPR was set up as a way to protect us from a severe supply disruption. By tapping SPR to manipulate price, we make ourselves even more vulnerable to the supply disruption. We need to recognize that price volatility has been a fundamental feature of crude oil markets for three decades and is common in the commodity markets. 
   We also need to recognize we have made some classic policy blunders in attempting to reduce this volatility. Invariably, these measures, such as price controls in the seventies, clearly aggravated and perpetuated what would otherwise have been a much shorter lived problem. 
   The second problem with this approach is it would only represent a partial plan. We cannot move forward with an energy strategy of ``sell oil when prices are high'' and not have a companion strategy of ``buy oil when prices are low.'' We have to mix the price structure in SPR. At one time, the administration proposed to buy and was buying at $40. The next minute, they wanted to sell at $27. There is a mentality up there that we somehow can make up the difference in volume. That does not work. What would be the purpose of depleting a reserve if we do not have a concrete plan to fill it? 
   The second suggestion is to encourage other countries to ramp up their production levels so the United States can import more of their oil. Think about that. We are encouraging other nations to increase their production so we can get more of their oil so that we can be even more vulnerable to that particular supply. Even some of my friends on Pennsylvania Avenue have advocated this as a resolve. 
   The Secretary of Energy has been quoted as saying: I am going to meet with the oil ministries of Venezuela, of Norway, Saudi Arabia, and others. This is a strategy to encourage the Venezuelans and Saudis to produce more oil and for the United States to become more dependent on those sources. 
   Their strategy is to spend millions of dollars supporting development of oil fields in other nations. Here is the kicker: They have even supported policies that have allowed the Iraqis to produce more oil. That is our good friend, Saddam Hussein. Are the people of Iraq benefiting or are his Republican Guards? I do not have to tell you, Mr. President, because you know as well as I do. 
   Their answers lead to nothing more than the export of American jobs and increased imports of foreign oil. Their answers make us more susceptible to price volatility in the future, not less. 
   Finally, the third suggestion is that Congress appropriate more money next year to subsidize the Low-Income Housing Energy Assistance Program. I do not oppose this. However, throwing more money toward that program will not solve the underlying problem, and the underlying problem is very simple: We are not producing enough oil and gas in the United States. This is not to imply nothing can be done to protect ourselves from vulnerability to aggressive price policy by OPEC, there is a solution, and it begins 
   at home. 
   The old adage, charity begins at home, is a far better approach to reducing our vulnerability to OPEC pricing, and that should begin by addressing the problems of our domestic U.S. oil and gas industry. We can do that very easily. We do not have the luxury in the United States of manipulating stocks and influencing price. The reason we do not is because we are 56-percent dependent on imported oil. We are currently not that big, in terms of oil production, to manipulate world prices. We have to make our strategic decisions through drilling strategies, and when we look at what has happened to drilling in the United States, we ought to be gravely concerned about the future volatility of heating and transportation fuel prices in the U.S. 
   In 1998, there was a decline of almost 60 percent in rigs drilling for oil in the United States. This was followed by a decline in the number of new and producing oil wells which was followed by a drop in our reserves. In 1998, only 24 percent of our domestic oil production was replaced by proven oil reserves. 
   The bare results of 1998 was that thousands of oil industry workers were laid off, drilling contractors were cut to the bone, our stripper wells went dry, and marginal wells were shut in. 
   This did not just happen. The administration knew what was going on. What did it do? It continued to thwart access by our domestic oil and gas industry to Federal lands where there was a promising likelihood of discovery. 
   It continues to try to force an unfair rule change for calculating oil royalties down the throats of our domestic producers. This is a not-so-subtle message to our domestic producers--you are not wanted here. The only effect these policies will have is to ensure that we continue to be susceptible to being taken hostage by aggressive OPEC pricing strategies and that we continue to encourage an outflow of U.S. capital, ingenuity, and investment to foreign shores to produce foreign oil so we can become more dependent on those sources.  
   Common sense tells us that if we are to become less dependent on OPEC pricing, if we want to be better able to respond to future price fluctuations, we must reinforce our domestic petroleum industry. 
   I understand my Northeast colleagues' concern about their constituents paying too high a price for heating and transportation oil. Frankly, we pay a higher price in Alaska. But I am not here to debate that issue at this time. I am also puzzled that many of those same Members of this body have continued to support efforts that would increase our susceptibility to this price volatility. You can't have it both ways. We are dependent on foreign stocks for 56 percent of our supplies. The only way we are ever going to break this cycle of dependence on foreign oil and our vulnerability to price is by boosting our own production here at home. 
   I can suggest that a good place to start is on the west coast. A good place to start is in my State of Alaska, where we have been supplying this Nation with 20 percent of its domestic oil for the last 20 years. Recently the U.S. Geologic Survey estimated that an area set aside by Congress for an evaluation of its oil and gas potential could have up to 16 billion barrels of recoverable oil. The 1998 estimate is the highest estimate ever published regarding the 1002 area. This body voted in 1995 to support environmentally sound exploration in this area. The Senate voted on this bill, but the Clinton administration vetoed the bill. They vetoed the ANWR bill. It has become a cry for environmentalism all over the country. If you initiate oil exploration in ANWR, you are going to violate this area, this pristine area. 
   How many people have taken the time to understand the significance of ANWR? There are 19 million acres in ANWR. It is an area about the size of the State of South Carolina. What have we done to try to maintain protection in these areas? We have taken 8 million acres of the 19 million acres and put it in wilderness in perpetuity. We have taken another 9.5 million acres and protected it as a refuge in perpetuity. But we set aside 1.5 million acres in the coastal plain, the so-called 1002 area, under the jurisdiction of the Congress to make a determination whether that portion and that portion only could be opened up for exploration. 
   Some of my colleagues talk about charity beginning at home, and suggest we ought to open up SPR. These are temporary measures that are basically impractical, that cut to the crux, if you will, of our national security interests, and don't resolve a long-term solution. What we should do is continue to advance science and technology, and develop domestic petroleum reserves. 
   The conclusion is obvious: If you don't support the industry's expertise and capability through advanced technology to continue to explore whether it be onshore or offshore, then you better be prepared for higher prices and the Northeast corridor better be prepared for price hikes as a consequence of cold weather, because we are looking right down the double barrels of the guns of control. Those guns of control come from the Mideast countries. 
   I think Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson has been quite correct in his response. He has agreed that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is to be used only for emergencies associated with our national energy security interests and not for price manipulation. He has also postponed delivery on 5 million barrels 
   of oil that the SPR would take at this time, an action which I think is responsible because it is intended to put more oil into the market and ease prices. It is going to help, but it is not going to help enough. 
   The President has released 44 million in emergency heating fuel funds. While I support these efforts, they alone are not enough. These are stopgap measures. They don't address the real problem of our continuing reliance on foreign oil and the resulting fact that we are going to be dancing to the tune of OPEC for the foreseeable future until we have the intestinal fortitude to recognize that we can develop domestic sources of oil and gas in the United States, and we can keep our jobs at home and lessen our dependence on imported oil. 
   Look at the facts. The fact is, during the tenure of this administration, U.S. demand for oil has increased 14 percent, and our domestic production, strangled by this administration's policies, has decreased 17 percent. You can't have it both ways. I am sympathetic to those Members who represent the Northeast corridor and are feeling the impact of a cold winter and high fuel prices. I would propose the following to address these concerns through the enhancement of a domestic industry policy. 
   First, give the industry greater access to Federal lands in the United States, both on and offshore, limiting to those States that want OCS activity. Louisiana is a good example; Texas is another. They recognize the contribution. They recognize the capability of the industry to do it safely. For the most part, the industry has done a pretty good job. 
   We should, second, develop incentive programs to make the U.S. oil and gas market more competitive in the world market. We should open up that tiny area of the Arctic oil reserve to environmentally sound exploration. Let's face it. Alaska produces 20 percent of the crude oil that this country enjoys today. That was authorized by the Senate on a tie vote where the Vice President had to break the tie to authorize the development of that. 
   There was great speculation that the 800-mile pipeline would somehow stop the caribou, would stop the moose. That has survived earthquakes, dynamite, shootings. It is one of the construction wonders of the world. Where would we have been without it? You would have had higher prices today, Mr. President. 
   Third, strengthen the Department of Energy's research and development program. We are going to be using petroleum products for a long, long time. You are not going to fly an airplane on solar or wind. You are going to fly it on fuel. Fourth, once and for all, throw out the MMS's attempts to change the rules on oil valuation. 
   Finally, let me refer to some who suggest that we don't need to look to the future of oil. We have a lot of gas in this country. It is just a matter of time. Gas is cheap. Let me refer you to a recent report by the National Petroleum and Gas Council. The demand for gas is going to be increasing about one-third in the next 10 years. There are going to be about 14 million new hookups for gas. The expenditure for that gas is going to be about $1.5 trillion. Hearings that we have had in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee show us that we do not have the infrastructure in place and we don't have access domestically to areas that have the potential for producing gas because the administration won't open them up for exploration. 
   I see my good friend from New York on the floor. I know of his interest in this crisis that is hitting the Northeast corridor. I encourage him and others to look toward a long-term solution. A long-term solution speaks for itself. It suggests through technology, with proper environmental safeguards, we can encourage more oil and gas exploration and development right here in this country, as opposed to increasing our dependence on OPEC where we are going to continue to have this problem, not just this February, but we are going to have it this March. And we are going to have 
   it next November and December and January, only by that time we might be 60 to 65 percent dependent on imported oil, as the Department of Energy suggests. Then you are going to have prices that are going to be coming down around our ears, and inflation will be attributed to a large degree to the price of oil and gas as a consequence to our increased dependence on imports. 
   Bottom line: Charity begins at home.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will respond to that. I recognize the sensitivity of my good friend, and the Senator from Maine, also. There are a couple of factors I think are very important to understand, and that is the ability of the strategic petroleum reserve to be moved out in a relatively short period of time the crude it has accumulated, or any portion of it, and transport it to refineries that aren't already up to the maximum capacity of their refining capability, and then move it to market because this winter isn't going to last forever. But right now, it is significant and very meaningful, as evidenced by the price associated with heating oil. 
   As I indicated in my floor statement, we have evidence by the Department of Energy that there are a number of ships in transit from Europe bringing heating oil. So there will be price relief soon. As you and I know, the price goes up a lot faster than it comes down. The idea of swaps certainly has merit and has been done before. But, traditionally, the manner in which the Federal Government in manipulating the sales of SPR has resulted in a situation where we have purchased high and sold low, and there is a mentality that suggests that we will make up the difference, with the taxpayers taking it in the shorts, so to speak--I am not suggesting we would not go back and replace SPR. Indeed, there are some logistic problems with the idea. One, you don't move it out of SPR very fast because it is in the salt caverns and there is only so much pumping capability and you have to move it to the refinery and then you have to refine it. The realization is that the refineries, as I understand it, in proximity to the SPR are pretty much up to their designed capacity. So what we need is an SPR of heating oil for you. That would be my best assessment of the current situation. But I am sensitive to the Senator's concern.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURKOWSKI. In response to my good friend from New York, I anticipate it would take at least 30-plus days to see any significant movement from the SPR, which is crude oil transported to a refinery in enough time to relieve the crisis of the high price in the Northeast. The problem is, the reserves of heating oil are down. I have discussed the rationale of why the reserves are low, but the fact is they are low. So as a consequence, we are left with a situation where price follows supply and demand, and we are certainly feeling the price. I think we should converse with our Secretary of Energy, who is attempting to interject with the Saudis, Venezuelans, Norwegians, and other oil-producing countries to try to encourage them to, if you will, increase their OPEC volume, which they have been remarkably solid in their ability to hold together and not do that. 
   They operate under two theories. One is they would like to have the highest possible price and produce the least amount of oil. But if that cartel cracks, then they still have to have the same volume of dollars to benefit their government, so they will produce more oil to get it. What we have seen as a consequence is the cartel coming together and holding tough. Subject to the ability of the Secretary of Energy to convince them to do otherwise, I would not look for immediate relief from that area. I think there is relief coming, but your constituents are going to be exposed to some high prices. As sympathetic as I am, I don't know the answer. 
   I just don't think SPR is going to be able to meet the demand in a timely enough manner by the time you get past another 30 days and some of this production in to your constituents. I don't think that is going to do what the market is doing now, which is bringing more heating oil that is already refined in Europe into the United States. I would much rather work ultimately for a long-term solution to our exposures because you have to look at the reality. We are going to be more and more exposed to the whims of OPEC. We have allowed Saddam Hussein and Iraq to come in with another 2 million barrels a day. That helps us and hurts us when you think about it. Who benefits from that? It is a complex problem. I have a hard time accepting that part of the role of SPR is to meet the domestic price manipulations as opposed to the philosophy that went into SPR, which was its design to be a strategic petroleum reserve in the sense of a time when our supplies may be cut off. There has been a great deal of criticism in my committee of the ability of SPR to be able to produce if a demand is there. There are a lot of shortcomings within SPR's makeup.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friends from Alaska and Nevada for that clarification. It is also my understanding that the provision is intended to protect large investments made in mining operations approved by the Department of Interior under its old interpretation of the law. Frankly, it would be shameful for us to endorse the actions of a Federal agency that approves a project, allows the proponent to spend millions of dollars to develop it, and then changes its mind about what the law says and on that basis shuts the operation down. I understand that the provision would protect these enormous investments and the jobs they create from such arbitrary action by the Department of Interior.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the chairman for that clarification. Finally, as my friend knows, mining operations are large, complex undertakings, and circumstances change all the time, requiring changes in the plan of operations. Miners must ask the BLM and Forest Service to approve amendments to their plans all the time in order to keep operating. In fact, the BLM and Forest Service often require these miners to amend their plans. I'm concerned that unless these types of amendments to existing plans are protected, the provision we are adopting would be of very little value. The BLM or the Forest Service could simply require an operator of a large existing mine to amend its plan of operations, and then deny the plan amendment and shut down the operation on the basis of the Solicitor's opinion. I would like clarification that amendments to existing plans are protected by the provision.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on November 1 of this year, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources reported S..623, the Dakota Water Resources Act of 1999, to the Senate. The legislation amends existing law in an effort to address the water needs of North Dakota. The legislation, as is true of most water related legislation in the arid West, is not without controversy. 
   Proposals to divert water from the Missouri River to meet agricultural, municipal and industrial, and other needs in North Dakota have a long history. The Missouri, like the Colorado and the Columbia, serves many States and a multitude of interests, including navigation. The Missouri is also important to the management and operation  of the Mississippi. Although there are sufficient resources in each of those Basins to meet all the water related needs if the resources were developed using on-stream and off-stream storage, that development has not occurred and for various reasons, including what I believe are short sighted concerns by national organizations, are not likely to occur in the near term. That being the case, it is not surprising that whenever any Basin State manages to corral all the competing interests in its State and even obtains support from the Administration that other States that could be potentially affected want to examine the agreement and reassure themselves that this particular solution does not come at their expense. 
   The best way to accomplish that is to bring all the parties together to allow them to review their concerns and work out whatever arrangement will best address their needs. Our Committee did just that several years ago as part of the legislation to settle the water claims of the Colorado Ute Tribes. Once we had revised the agreement in a fashion that was acceptable to the Tribes, the State of Colorado, and the other affected water users, we then had several weeks in intense discussions with the other Colorado River Basin States. I want to point to that process, because it did result in the passage of legislation that was supported by all the parties and provided for the completion of the Dolores and Animas projects. 
   I rise today to speak and offer reassurance to the North Dakota delegation and the Missouri delegation that the Energy and Natural Resources Committee is committed to assisting these two delegations in working out their difficulties regarding S..623, the Dakota Water Resources Act of 1999. 
   I appreciate the hard work and good will expressed by both delegations over the past several weeks, but we have just run out of time in this session of Congress to address the concerns of all affected states. To continue these discussions, I have proposed to my colleagues that when Congress returns next year, the Energy Committee will hold a workshop or other forum so that the Senate can fully identify, discuss, and attempt to resolve the issues that have prevented this legislation from moving this year. 
   With the assistance of my colleagues, I propose that the Energy Committee staff work with their staffs during the recess and that we convene a meeting during the first week in 
   February to bring all the parties together. Hopefully, if we use the time well during the recess, we can identify who the technical people are who need to be involved so that the delegations will be able to have a constructive meeting. I want to note that Senator SMITH, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Water and Power, who held the hearings earlier this year on the legislation has indicated that he is also willing to assist in this process.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to ask a question of the senior Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, in his capacity as chair of the full Committee on Appropriations, and the senior senator from Washington, Mr. GORTON, who is chair of the Interior Subcommittee, regarding clarification of a vital issue facing the State of Alaska. 
   The Year 2000 will be the 20th anniversary of the passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980. ANILCA is the most far-reaching piece of legislation ever passed--in the history of the United States--in terms of creating massive set-asides for conservation purposes.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today is a uniquely historic day. One hundred and thirty six years ago, Abraham Lincoln gave the Gettysburg Address. 80 years ago today, the United States Senate rejected the ill-conceived League of Nations. And 30 years ago, the second manned Apollo capsule landed on the moon and two more Americans walked on the surface of the moon. 
   But for the family of Deanna Tanner Okun, this is a singular day. For the United States Senate has just confirmed her Presidential nomination to be a Commissioner on the International Trade Commission. (ITC). I would note that it has taken Deanna barely nine days to go from nomination to confirmation. That could be close to a Senate record. 
   One of the reasons that Deanna's nomination has sped through so quickly is because the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, BILL ROTH, and the Ranking Member, PAT MOYNIHAN were willing to put in the work to hold a confirmation hearing barely six days after Deanna was nominated. I greatly appreciate their work in expediting that hearing. 
   But most importantly, I believe the primary reason Deanna's confirmation has gone so smoothly is because of the universal admiration and respect that Senators and professional staff hold for her. Deanna is simply a consummate professional and I know that the Senate's loss will be offset by the tremendous gain that is being achieved today by the ITC. today. I know the Commission will never be the same once Deanna is sworn in. 
   Mr. President, I have been privileged to have worked with Deanna for more than five years. I cannot imagine anyone who is more qualified to become a Commissioner on the International Trade Commission. Not only is Deanna remarkably bright, she is one of the most thorough and conscientious individuals I have ever met. 
   She is fully versed in all aspects of international trade matters and an expert on U.S. foreign policy issues. No one can doubt her intellectual and professional capacity to serve as a Commissioner. 
   Mr. President, I want to repeat some of my prepared remarks for Deanna's confirmation hearing. 
   But I want to tell the United States Senate a little about Deanna, the person. she is a remarkably affable and charming individual who, no matter what the pressures--whether negotiating in a markup of a trade bill or working under the time constraints of a hearing on spying at U.S. weapons laboratories--Deanna never loses her professionalism. She always gets the job done. 
   In the years that she has worked on my staff, she has had to deal with some of the most difficult and tough Senate staffers in the leadership and on many committees. I know that every single one of those staff people have universal respect and admiration for the work Deanna does and the charm she brings to the job. That is a singular feat that few other Senate staffers can claim. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I would note that three years ago, Deanna changed her work schedule from five days a week to four days a week. She did this because she wanted to spend more time raising her two beautiful daughters, Kelsi and Rachel. I can unhesitatingly tell you that in those four days at work, she produces what other staffers could maybe produce in five, more likely six days. She is truly remarkable as a mother and as a professional staffer. 
   She is a stellar person and I know that her husband Bob and her parents take great pride in her confirmation. 
   It is difficult to lose Deanna after all these years. I will miss her, but I know that the world trade community will greatly benefit from her appointment to the Commission. 
   Thank you, Mr. President and to Deanna, I wish you the best of success in your new position. 
   Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think we all owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to the senior Senator from West Virginia. 
   What we have now is a situation concerning mining in the U.S. where a crucial decision is either going to be made to maintain an atmosphere where mining can continue or through the prevailing attitude within the Clinton administration to simply drive this industry offshore. 
   The Clinton administration, by its actions, evidently opposes the working people of America who are involved in mining. 
   Those opposing Senator BYRD's proposal basically are destroying the entire coal industry which exists west of the Mississippi--the mine workers whose jobs depend on that industry, the railroad workers, the barge men, and the truck drivers. 
   I think it is important to note that Senator BYRD's amendment directs the application of the Clean Water Act to be returned to the way it was at the beginning of October of this year. 
   Senator BYRD's amendment does not change the law. It does not change any practice that has been followed over the years. It is our job to change the law--not the White House and not the courts. 
   Senator BYRD's amendment gives the Congress and the Federal agencies time to apply existing law without destroying the coal mining industry of this country--time to apply the law, or make such adjustments that are necessary in a way that protects the environment, the coal mining industry, and all those who depend upon that industry for their well-being. 
   We are looking for a balance. The administration's proposal throws this out of balance. 
   The amendment goes further. There are two additional issues involved. 
   One deals with the recent Solicitor's opinion that would throw out 127 years of precedent on the size of mill sites--only 5 acres per claim, if followed through with, this would make mining on public lands absolutely impossible. 
   I do not know how many Members have an idea about what it takes to make up a mine. The mine needs a mill site, grinding and crushing facilities, shops, processing plants, tailings disposal, headquarters, a water plant, parking lots, and roads. This simply cannot fit on the space provided within the 5-acre mill site per claim. It simply can't be done. This is how they propose to eliminate mining. In my State of Alaska, we would not have a new mine developed, nor could we. 
   You are depriving us and this country the right to produce minerals from the rich resources we have. 
   Make no mistake; the Solicitor wrote the opinion to end mining in the West, to drive mining offshore, to drive the jobs offshore, and to drive the dollars offshore. 
   The provision in this amendment would allow mining operations that have been submitting plans prior to a recent Solicitor's opinion to continue under the law and the precedent that was relied on the developed plan.  
   The second issue is also a simple provision that would require the administration to follow sound science for a change--not emotion. 
   The provision would limit the ability of the Secretary of 
   the Interior to propose new hard rock mining regulations for those areas where the National Academy of Science found that there were deficiencies. Why not give science a chance instead of emotion? 
   Finally, the National Academy of Science found that State and current Federal regulations on hard rock mining sufficiently protected the environment and needed only a few changes to bring it up to current standards. 
   What is wrong with the objective of the National Academy of Science? 
   There are two simple provisions: One that provides fundamental fairness by allowing companies that have relied on 127 years of interpretation to continue while the courts sort out whether this new interpretation is legal; and one that requires the administration to follow and comply with sound science. 
   We are calling for fundamental fairness and sound science. But the White House, in its single-minded determination to end the domestic mining industry, seems to have denied us both. 
   I certainly appreciate the support of the senior Senator from West Virginia. He has a sympathy and an understanding for the needs of the mining industry. 
   Unfortunately, we have seen these differences of opinion between the West and the East. But we certainly now have a common interest. 
   There is going to be little for the domestic mining industry to celebrate this Thanksgiving. 
   The White House, to serve its environmental constituency and the aspirations of, I guess, the Vice President, has abandoned the call for sound science. They are appealing to emotion. 
   We need fairness. We need to meet the needs of the men and women who labor in our mines. 
   This Nation will pay the price as coal mines in West Virginia, mining sites throughout the West, and in my State of Alaska close. Good, honest jobs that built this Nation will be lost. Union and nonunion workers will join the bread line that this administration will leave as its legacy for the mining industry. 
   I yield the floor. 
   I thank the President for his patience and perseverance.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. For the information of all Senators, when the Senate convenes, it will begin consideration of a number of legislative items that have been cleared for action and need to be considered in the House prior to adjournment. Following the consideration of these bills, the Senate will resume debate on the final appropriations bill. Further, as a reminder, cloture was filed today on the appropriations conference report, and there is still hope that the Wisconsin delegation will allow the cloture vote to occur at a reasonable hour during tomorrow's session. However, if no agreement is made, the cloture vote will occur at 1:01 a.m. on Saturday morning, and abbreviated postcloture debate is anticipated. Therefore, Senators can expect a vote to occur a few hours after the cloture vote. 
   In addition, the Senate may consider the Work Incentives conference report prior to the pending adjournment.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague for his remarks on the bankruptcy bill. 
   I think one thing--while it is not necessarily appropriate to recognize on the bankruptcy bill--we should recognize is the inability of our Federal Government to honor the sanctity of contractual commitments. I can think offhand of the agreement that was made by the Federal Government some two decades ago to take the high-level nuclear waste by the year 1998. The ratepayers paid something in the area of $15 billion into that fund for the Federal Government to meet its contractual obligation. The pending lawsuits are somewhere between $40 billion and $80 billion. Obviously, the Federal Government doesn't set a very good example. 
   This is not necessarily apropos to bankruptcy, but it is apropos to the theory that we pay our bills, that we honor the sanctity of our contracts. The old saying is, ``Charity begins at home.'' The Government should set the example. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business for approximately 30 minutes.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, with the recent passage of a Senate Finance Committee trade package aimed at liberalizing trade with African and Caribbean countries, and providing Trade Adjustment Assistance for American workers who need help transitioning into different jobs, I thought it an appropriate time to come to the floor of the Senate to discuss the insidious propaganda campaign the Clinton Administration is orchestrating over the phoney charges of ``isolationism'' he has leveled at Congress. 
   In some ways, I am reluctant to get into this name-calling argument. As I told my six children as they faced the normal school yard taunts, you shouldn't dignify the name caller with a response. Something like the old adage, ``Sticks and stones will break my bones, but names will never hurt me.'' 
   The difference between Washington and the school yard, however, is that it seems that if you repeat a lie long enough, and in enough places, the media will parrot it out to the country and around the world as if it were true. And that is very, very serious for two reasons. 
   First, it distorts the political process and deceives the American public. More importantly, it sends a false and dangerous signal to the enemies of America that their dream of disengaging America from world leadership may, in fact, be happening. Nothing could be further from the truth, but when the President of the United States, and his flunkies, says it, terrorists around the world applaud. 
   Certainly there are Republicans, Democrats, Reform Party members and independents who proudly wear the isolationist label, but to try and smear Congress with that label is reprehensible. 
   So I want to look at what actions the Clinton Administration calls isolationist, and to separate fact from fiction. 
   Two weeks ago, National Security Advisor Sandy Berger gave a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations decrying as ``isolationist'' and ``defeatist'' such actions as the Senate's refusal to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (``CTBT'') and, as Mr. Berger characterized it, a Congress ``reluctant to support the Climate Change Treaty.'' 
   Mr. President, it should not even pass the straight face test to label Senators such as RICHARD LUGAR and CHUCK HAGEL, among others, as isolationists just because we voted against a treaty that we did not think would preserve our national security in the years and decades ahead. 
   Would Sandy Berger have the audacity to call former Secretary of State and Nobel Peace Prize Winner Henry Kissinger an isolationist because he was ``not persuaded that the proposed treaty would inhibit nuclear proliferation'' and therefore recommended voting against the treaty? 
   Does Berger's isolationist tag also apply to six former Secretaries of Defense--James Schlesinger, Dick Cheney, Frank Carlucci, Caspar Weinberger, Donald Rumsfeld and Melvin Laird because they wrote the Senate leadership and stated:  
   We believe ..... a permanent, zero-yield Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty incompatible with the Nation's international commitments and vital security interests and believe it does not deserve the Senate's advice and consent.  
   Mr. President, the Senate rejected a flawed treaty; the fault lies not with so-called isolationists in Congress, but with the appeasers and former ``nuclear freeze'' people who are now in the Clinton Administration and negotiated this treaty which was not in America's national security interest. 
   As to the Climate Change Treaty, Congress is not reluctant to consider the Treaty. In fact, we have been asking this President to send the Treaty up, but he refuses. And he refuses because 95 Senators expressed the strong sense of the Senate that the Kyoto protocol contain commitments from developing countries to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Of course, this has not happened. This is not an isolationist fear of technological change. This is a realistic assessment of how you accomplish your goals. 
   On Monday, USTR Barshefsky also took up the isolationism call. At a speech to the foreign press describing the U.S. agenda for the upcoming WTO ministerial meeting in Seattle, Ambassador Barshefsky said that isolationists ``at times believe that a growing economy and a clean environment cannot coexist.'' 
   Mr. President, I hope the Ambassador does not mean to imply that simply because Congress has not signed off on loading up trade agreements with the baggage of the extreme environmentalist agenda that we are isolationists? 
   In fact, I wonder if this cry of isolationism is not simply to divert attention from the failures of this Administration to pursue trade opening measures in the face of domestic pressure from Unions? 
   If expanding trade is so important to the President, he could have welcomed the April 8 offer by the Chinese Premier to make extraordinary concessions to bring China into the World Trade Organization. 
   But he did not. 
   If expanding trade is so important to the President, he could have directed his Administration to work with the Finance Committee to craft a compromise on fast track trade negotiating authority that would address the legitimate concerns of those who do not want to see labor and environment slogans used as smoke screens for protectionist measures. 
   But he did not lift a finger to support fast track for fear of offending his protectionist political supporters in organized labor 
   So Mr. President, I don't think President Clinton should have sent his National Security Advisor or his USTR out to falsely label my party as the one turning its back on the world. 
   This is not to say that there are not some countries who should receive a cold shoulder rather than a warm embrace. I do not support aiding and comforting our enemies--like Iraq and North Korea. This is not about a choice between isolationism or engagement. This is about what form of engagement will bring the desired results.  
   It is in these areas where I think the Administration has a backwards policy--rather than rewarding good behavior, we are rewarding bad behavior. 
   Since 1994 when the U.S. adopted an ``Agreed Framework'' with North Korea, here are just some of the acts by North Korea: 
   Launched a three-stage missile last summer, and continues to work on and export missiles capable of hitting the United States; 
   Worked on vast underground construction complex--historically used by North Korea to cover work on military or nuclear installations; 
   Taken actions to hinder work of international inspectors sent to monitor North Korea's nuclear program; 
   Sent submarine filled with commandos to South Korea; and 
   Violated the military armistice agreement by firing on ROK soldiers. 
   Today, the North Korea Advisory Group in the House of Representatives released a report that found that ``the comprehensive threat posed by North Korea to our national security has increased since 1994.'' 
   What has been the U.S. response? 
   DPRK is now the No. 1 recipient of U.S. assistance in East Asia: $645 million since 1995 includes providing at least 45% of fuel needs and over 80% of food aid; and sending 500,000 tons of oil a year, as well as trying to get other countries to come up with the funds for KEDO (Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization) and for two light-water reactors. 
   I cannot say for certain that North Korea's government would have collapsed without our help. But I do not think that it will ever fall with two strong American legs holding it up. 
   And how about U.S. policy toward Iraq?

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I will be responding to some statements that were made during a debate that was held on this floor late last week concerning the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1999, which the leadership attempted to bring before this body. It was objected to by the other side. 
   I will take this opportunity to go back and forth between truth and fiction regarding this issue, because I think it is important we all have an opportunity to review the facts as opposed to the rhetoric that suggested that some things are risky when, in reality, we have addressed that risk through technology or other means. Last week, there was an allegation made that the radiation release standards for the permanent repository at Yucca Mountain contained in S. 1287 are inconsistent with the range of 2 to 20 millirem suggested by the National Academy of Sciences. 
   In the real world, somebody has to make these judgment calls regarding what level of radiation the public will recognize as being valid and protective of their interests. This level should be determined not by emotion but by sound science. The question is, Who has the sound science? 
   We believe the National Academy of Sciences certainly has that scientific expertise to make these judgments. As a consequence, we believe they should play a role in setting the radiation standard, as required by the Energy Policy Act of 1992. 
   What we are going to do here is respond to the myth by reminding my colleagues that the National Academy of Sciences, in fact, did not make a recommendation for a specific radiation standard nor a range of exposure levels. Going back to page 49 of the NAS report, it states:  
   We do not directly recommend a level of acceptable risk.  
   In fact, the NAS said the appropriate risk level was a decision for policymakers. Congress is the ultimate decisionmaker on policy. S. 1287 establishes the basis for regulations that protect the public health and safety and the  environment from radiation releases at repositories. 
   My good friends and colleagues from Nevada will have you believe I have something against the people of Nevada. I do not have a constituency with regard to this issue because in Alaska we do not have an operating nuclear plant, therefore we do not have nuclear waste. However, as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I have an obligation and an oversight responsibility to address and resolve this issue. 
   The reality is, I am very sensitive to the feelings of the people in Nevada regarding the waste. But we have to store it somewhere. The logic has always been that the best place to store this waste is in an area where we have had 50 years of nuclear testing, out in the desert. That is what we have done in the study of the feasibility of placing a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain, where we have expended over $6 billion already.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I appreciate you pointing that out again. 
   As you know from the chart, it does say 80 millirems is the exposure we get here in the Capitol. If you live in a brick house, you get 70 millirems. You get 53 millirems of additional exposure from cosmic radiation in Denver, as a result of the higher altitude. The average radiation from the ground is 26 millirems. An x ray is 20. A dental x ray is 14, and you have to write a check for it. A round-trip flight from New York to Los Angeles is 6. Exposure for a half hour from a transport container to a truck 6 feet away is 5 millirems. 
   It is important that we put these in perspective.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. In responding to the Senator from Alabama, a little over $15 billion has been paid to the Federal Government. The Federal Government agreed to take the waste beginning in 1998. Clearly, that date has come and gone.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I might add also, there is a significant legal obligation for noncompliance with that contractual agreement, somewhere between $50 and $80 billion. I happen to be a banker and know something about money, but I am not as familiar as perhaps a lawyer would be with the significance of a settlement for damages, but it is going to cost the taxpayer a bundle.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. The only explanation I can give my friend from Alabama is, for reasons I can only assume are associated with the objections from antinuclear groups, this administration has simply chosen to ignore its obligation on the issue of nuclear waste. We have an industry that is strangling on its own waste. Our technology has created that waste. On the other hand, we are dependent for about 20 percent  of our power on nuclear power generation. Obviously, it has made a substantial contribution to the air quality because there are no air emissions from nuclear power. As we look at the French, they are almost 90-percent dependent on nuclear energy. 
   They have chosen not to be held hostage by the Mideast as they were in the 1973-74 timeframe. So they have developed almost entirely their power generation on a nuclear power generating industry and their sophistication of disposing of the waste is through technology. They take the waste and reprocess it, recover the plutonium, put it back in the reactors, and burn it, and hence reduce the proliferation. The residue is vitrified like a glass and that is buried, but it has a relatively short life. 
   So while we are committed to permanently disposing of our high-level waste at Yucca, there is another alternative that we have precluded ourselves from pursuing, which, in my opinion, is probably the right way to go, and it is the way the Japanese are going as well.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is a very interesting point the Senator has brought up, because if we look at the clean air proposal of this administration and the proposal that 7 1/2 percent could come from renewables, we have to question whether we have that technology. 
   Somebody said if you took every square foot of New Mexico and Arizona and put solar panels across, you would only get half of 1 percent, because it gets dark once in a while and the wind doesn't blow all the time. So we have real problems with facing reality in the administration's proposal. There is no mention of the role of nuclear power in that proposal. Nor do they consider hydroelectric generation as a renewable, which is beyond me, because it rains, the lakes fill up, and the hydro works. But it is a mentality currently within this administration. 
   I appreciate the Senator bringing up these points, but in the clean air proposal by this administration, there is no role for nuclear. Clearly, there has to be.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that attempts to diminish the scope of a problem that is facing our air transport industry, namely a critical shortage of pilots. The pilot shortage is starting to have effects in many rural states. 
   In response to this problem. I am today introducing a bill that would repeal the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) rule which now requires pilots who fly under Part 121 to retire at ago 60. Under my legislation, pilots in excellent health would be allowed to continue to pilot commercial airliners until their 65th birthday. 
   The Age 60 rule was instituted 40 years ago when commercial jets were first entering service. The rule was established without the benefit of medical or scientific studies or public comment. The most recent study, the results of which were released in 1993, examined the correlation between age and accident rate as pilots approach 60. That study found no increase in accidents. 
   The FAA contends that although science does not dictate retirement at the age of 60, it is the age range when sharp increases in disease mortality and morbidity occur. In FAA's view it is too risky to allow older pilots to fly the largest aircraft, carrying the greatest number of passengers over the longest non-stop distances, in the highest density traffic. 
   However, 44 countries worldwide have relaxed then age 60 rule within the last ten years primarily because the pilot shortage is a worldwide phenomenon. Many of these air carriers currently fly into U.S. airspace. 
   One of the ways carriers are attempting to adapt to the shortage is to lower their flight time requirements. In my view, this is a risk factor the FAA should be concerned about. 
   How did this shortage occur? The reason is simple: There has been an explosive growth of the major airlines worldwide, and there's a shortage of military pilots who used to feed the system. In addition, there is an aging pilot pool that must retire at age 60. 
   Add to this domino effect the decline in the number of people learning to fly, due primarily to the cost, and the pool of available pilots has shrunk. 
   The shortage acutely affects my home state of Alaska because we depend on air transport far more than any other state. Rural residents in Alaska have 
    no way out other than by air service. There are no rural routes, state or interstate highways serving most rural residents in Alaska and the airplane for many of them is their lifeline to the outside world. 
   The pilot shortage has left Alaskan carriers scrambling for pilots. Alaska's carriers must hire from the available pilot pool in the lower 48. Many of these pilots view flying in Alaska as a stepping stone that allows them to build up flight time. Although they get great flying experience in my home state, in nearly all instances when a pilot gets a higher-pay job offer with a larger carrier in the lower 48, he leaves Alaska. 
   According to the Alaska Air Carriers Association, raising the retirement age to 65 will help alleviate the shortage and keep experienced pilots flying and serving rural Alaskans. 
   Mr. President, I would note that what is happening across the country is that the major carriers are luring pilots from commuter airlines, who in turn recruit from the air charter and corporate industry, who in turn hire flight instructors, agriculture pilots, etc. Which leaves rural carriers strapped. The big fish are feeding off the little ones. 
   Small carriers simply cannot compete with the salaries, benefits and training costs of the major carriers. They simply do not have the financial resources. 
   According to figures provided by the Federal Aviation Administration, there were 694,000 pilots in 1988 and 616,342 in 1997. Within that number, private pilot certificates fell from approximately 300,000 in 1988 to 247,604 in 1997. Commercial certificates, like air taxi and small commuter pilots, fell from 143,000 in 1988 to 125,300 in 1997. The number of total pilots in Alaska fell from more than 10,000 in 1988 to approximately 8,700 in 1997. 
   However, light is beginning to show at the end of the tunnel.  
   Organizations such as the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) and the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA) have been monitoring this shortage for some time and have stepped up to the plate to get people interested in flying. AOPA has started a pilot mentoring program in 1994 and approximately 30,000 have entered the program. GAMA's ``Be a Pilot'' program is starting to bring more potential pilots into flight training. 
   Even the Air Force is starting to institute new programs to keep pilots. 
   In Alaska, as a result of a precedent-setting program involving Yute Air, the Association of Village Council Presidents, the University of Alaska, Anchorage, Aero Tech Flight Service, Inc., and the FAA, a program was developed to train rural Alaska Natives to fly. Seven are on their way to pilot careers. 
   Also, the number of students working on pilot licenses at the University's Flight Technology program has almost doubled in two years. 
   It is my hope that the shortage has hit rock bottom. But even so, it will take years before a cadre of qualified pilots is ready to take to the friendly skies. 
   Mr. President, the time has come for Congress to wrestle with this problem. As long as a pilot can pass the rigorous medical exam, he or she should be allowed to fly. Air service is critical to keep commerce alive, especially in rural states.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the amendment (#2359) proposed by Senators CONRAD and GRASSLEY which would tailor the Trade Adjustment Assistance program so that it helps farmers and fishermen--two groups that are not adequately assisted under the current TAA program. 
   I voted for this amendment at the Finance Committee markup, and was disappointed that it failed by a narrow margin. But I am pleased that Senators CONRAD and GRASSLEY persevered in pushing this important issue forward. I also want to thank the authors of this amendment for working with my staff to ensure that the provisions cover fishermen in Alaska and Louisiana and other areas along with farmers in the Midwest because these two groups face similar problems. 
   Finally, I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH and Senator MOYNIHAN, for accepting this amendment today. I urge them to insist on retaining this language at conference with our House colleagues. 
   I have long been an advocate of opening markets abroad for U.S. exporters, and putting in place rules to facilitate trade between the nations. I voted for the NAFTA and the Uruguay Round. I support the Finance Committee managers' amendment to the underlying bill which will change our focus in Africa from aid to trade, will give the Caribbean nations parity in their trade with the United States. In addition, I support reauthorizing two important programs; the Trade Adjustment Assistance program and the Generalized System of Preferences program. 
   But even as we pursue liberalized trade initiatives, we must work harder to help Americans adjust to a changing business climate that is often affected by events half way around the World. For while we can take pride in an historically low unemployment rate nationwide that occurred partly as a result of our open and innovative workplace and trading rules, certain sectors and certain parts of the country are still facing employment losses or income losses as a result of low worldwide commodity prices. Fishermen and Farmers fall in this category. 
   Let me just use one example. An Alaskan fishing Sockeye Salmon was getting $1.18 per pound in 1996. But last year, that price had sunk to 85 cents--a 28% drop, and a 17% drop over the five-year average. And the drop came in the face of rising imports. Foreign imports of seafood have steadily risen since 1992 while exports have steadily fallen over the same period. 
   The current TAA program is better suited to traditional manufacturing firms and workers, than to farmers and fishermen. When imports cause layoffs in manufacturing industries, workers are eligible for TAA. In my own state of Alaska, TAA has played an important role both in the oil industry and for the seafood processors. But an independent fisherman does not go to the dock and receive a pink slip, he goes to the radio and hears the latest price for salmon, and he knows that his family's livelihood is threatened. TAA has not been available in his circumstances. 
   As the authors of this amendment have explained, the TAA for Farmers and Fishers would set up a new program where individual farmers could apply for assistance if two criteria are met. 
   First, the national average price for the commodity for the year dropped more than 20% compared to the average price in the previous five years. 
   Second, imports ``contributed importantly'' to the price reduction. 
   If these two criteria are met, fishermen would be eligible for cash benefits based on the fishermen's loss of income. The cash benefits would be  capped at $10,000 per fisherman. Retraining and other TAA benefits available to workers under TAA also would be available to fishermen interested in leaving for some other occupation. 
   Mr. President, I believe that this change in the TAA program is long overdue. Again, I want to stress that the traditional TAA program still plays an important role, and I do not want to diminish its current role--but to expand it. The TAA program averts the need for more money in unemployment compensation, welfare, food stamps and other unemployment programs--in short, it keeps Americans employed and able to support themselves and their families. 
   Let me end, Mr. President, by returning to a few points on the underlying bill. It is unfortunate, in my view, that this might be the only piece of trade legislation that we move this entire Congress. 
   As you might guess, trade with Africa and the Caribbean Basin countries is not that important to Alaska. I am deeply disappointed that we are not looking at a WTO agreement with China. I continue to believe that President Clinton made a mistake by rejecting the deal that was put together in April, and might not ever get put back together in the same manner. I am also deeply disappointed that we have not considered trade negotiating authority that would be a strong vote of confidence as our negotiators head to the Seattle Round. 
   Nevertheless, I commend the Chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, and the Ranking Member, Senator MOYNIHAN, and our Majority Leader for bringing this legislation to the floor. Perhaps, if we are able to move forward on this piece of legislation, the logjam will be broken. Let's hope.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, it is my understanding that it was the leader's intention to lay down the nuclear waste bill, but there has been an objection raised. As a consequence, it is my understanding that we will be discussing the bill, recognizing that there may be procedural action by the leadership at a later date regarding the disposition of this legislation. 
   It is my intention to simply discuss the merits of the bill for a period that would accommodate the President, as well as my colleagues, recognizing it is Friday afternoon and there are Members who perhaps have other plans. 
   While it is not my intention to communicate to this body every thought concerning this matter that I have. I do have, through the cooperation of my staff, probably enough material to take 6 or 7 days. Hopefully, it will not take that long to convince my colleagues that we have a problem in this country with our high-level nuclear waste program. 
   It is no secret there are not a number of States that are standing in line to take this waste. The fact is, most Members would wish for some type of a magic trick that would make this waste disappear. But the facts are, this waste is with us. It was created by an industry which contributes some 20 to 22 percent of the total electric energy produced in the United States. So it is our obligation to address how we are going to handle that waste. 
   We have, I think, like the ostrich, put our head in the sand regarding advanced technology addressing high-level nuclear waste that has advanced in other countries, particularly in France, and to a degree Great Britain and Asia. 
   The technology varies, but the basic premise is that spent fuel coming from our depleted cores within the reactors are taken, and through a chemical process, the plutonium is recovered and returned to the reactors as fuel. This is an oversimplification of the process, but, as a consequence, the proliferation threat of the plutonium is reduced dramatically because it is burned in the reactors. Not every existing reactor can utilize this technology, but technology is clearly available. 
   What is done with the rest of the waste? It is vitrified. That means the remaining waste is turned into a glass. The lifetime of that material has been reduced dramatically. It still must be stored, but it has a lesser radioactive life. 
   What we have here is a situation where my good friends on the other side have objected to consideration of this bill. 
   That objection suggests that they might have some other alternative other than simply delaying a resolution of this problem. If there is another alternative other than delay, I would hope my friends on the other side would bring that to my attention. 
   For the sake of full disclosure, as the junior Senator from Alaska, I do not have a constituency in my State on this issue. 
   My hands, so to speak, from a self-interest point of view, are pretty clean. Oftentimes we have Members who are trying to foster a particular policy based on an interest in their State. We don't have high-level nuclear waste in Alaska. We have never had a nuclear power reactor, with the exception of a small program back in the early 1960s on one of our military bases. That facility has since been removed. The point is, the obligation I have is one as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to try to get my colleagues to recognize that we collectively have a responsibility as to what we are going to do with this waste. 
   The industry is strangling on its waste. If we don't address it in a responsible way, the industry will decline. It will decline for a couple of reasons. The storage at many reactors is at, or almost at, the maximum limit allowed by their licenses. That means that each reactor is licensed for the amount of waste that can be stored on the site of the reactor. Many of you have been to nuclear reactors. You have seen the blue pools where the spent rods are stored. There is a limit to how much storage is available. As a consequence, we run into a situation where some reactors have reached their maximum limit under the authorization and cannot continue to operate without some relief. 
   That relief, as I will indicate to my colleagues, was to have been provided by the Federal Government. The Federal Government contracted with the nuclear power industry in the United States to take this waste beginning in 1998. As often is the case, the Government doesn't seem to honor the sanctity of contractual commitments to the level the private sector does. The Government was unprepared to take this waste in 1998, even though there had been a continuing effort to meet the Government's obligation by opening a facility at Yucca Mountain, in Nevada, for the permanent placement of high-level nuclear waste. To date there has been almost $7 billion expended in that process. That facility is not ready. 
   So what we have before us is a situation where the Government has violated its contractual commitments. The damages associated with that currently are estimated to be $40 to $80 billion. The U.S. taxpayer is going to have to accept the responsibility for these damages as a consequence of the Government's failure to initiate taking of the waste in 1998. 
   When you look at $40 to $80 billion, you must recognize that this obligation arises as a consequence of DOE's failure to perform the contract. This is basically damages. So we have a situation where nobody wants the waste, including the Federal Government that is contracted to take the waste as of 1998. We have a stalemate. We have an effort to ignore this waste as though it didn't exist, that it will go away. Some would even make the generalization that the Clinton administration simply does not want to address this issue on their watch. 
   There are all kinds of interests here. There are some of the environmental groups that don't want to see this issue resolved. They want to kill the nuclear power industry in this country. They certainly don't want to see it grow. There has not been a new reactor ordered in the United States since 1979. So we are not advancing, and we are not standing still; we are stepping back. 
   The consequences of this are: What are we going to do? How do we meet our obligation to provide power if, indeed, we lose a portion of our nuclear industry? Some suggest we will just reach out and find more natural gas.  We have had hearings in our committee that indicate you just don't plug in if you need more natural gas; you are going to have to depend on an expanded distribution system. That expanded distribution system isn't going to be built unless there is an increase in the price of gas. And to suggest you are going to have cheap gas available is strictly speculation. You will have to go after deeper gas. To give someone the incentive to drill in these more difficult areas, you are going to have to increase the price. 
   As a consequence, the critics of this legislation fail, I think, to meet their obligation to come up with an alternative as to where this energy is going to come from if we don't address this high-level nuclear waste issue. Leave it where it is? 
   Where is nuclear waste? Behind me we have a map that shows every Member of this body where it is today. It is stored in about 80 sites in 40 States. If you don't want to do anything about this, you are deciding to leave it where it is. Some of the Governors have indicated they are reluctant to support this legislation because it has been amended to accommodate the administration's proposal that it be authorized to take title to the waste at the site. The governors are fearful the waste will stay there. For the life of me, I can't understand that logic. If we don't do anything, it is going to stay there anyway. So we have to address the problem. Leave it where it is? Now you know where it is. 
   I am going to go through several States individually this afternoon because I think it is important that the States that depend on nuclear power have a general understanding of how much they have paid into the waste fund, how much they are dependent on nuclear power, and what is going to happen if we don't address this problem. 
   First is the State of Illinois. As you can see on the chart, the consumers in the State of Illinois have paid $2 billion into the Nuclear Waste Fund. What is the Waste Fund? It is the Government. They paid the Government to take this waste. This started in 1982. 
   How many units do we have in Illinois? We have the Braidwood 1 and 2, Byron 1 and 2, Clinton, Dresden 2 and 3, LaSalle 1 and 2, Quad Cities 1 and 2. How much waste is stored? We have 5,215 metric tons of waste in the State of Illinois. In addition, the Department of Energy research reactor fuel is stored there, 40 metric tons. If you don't find a place for this, what is going to happen? It is going to stay. Here, where it says ``no vacancies,'' are the reactors by name and when they run out of storage space: Dresden 3, the year 2000; Dresden 2 in the year 2003; Clinton, 2003; 2006; 2006; 2013; 2015; and 2019. 
   We have a crisis coming up because the earliest, from all estimates, that we can have a facility ready to receive waste is in the year 2007. That is the expedited schedule under S. 1287. We have done extensive work at Yucca Mountain. The tunneling is done. You can wander around in there. It looks very impressive. Why Yucca Mountain? Well, some of the people who make decisions decided that was the best place to put this waste because of the unique geography of the site. Nobody wants this material. Vermont has a lot of granite. It would probably make a good repository, but I am sure if the delegation from Vermont were here today, they would have something to say about it. 
   But the point is, it has to go somewhere. So they chose a site out in Nevada, a site where we have had nuclear testing for some 50 years. You might say it is polluted. It has been used over a period of time for hundreds of above-ground and underground nuclear explosions. So they decided to put it out there, and they spent almost $7 billion of the taxpayers' money. 
   Back in Illinois, how significant is nuclear power in the mix? It is 39 percent of Illinois' power. I hope every person in Illinois understands this because it is their lights and pocketbook. You want to get nuclear waste out of here? You want your reactors to continue to be able to produce power? Or do you want your electric rates to go up when these plants close? Are you going to hold the Government responsible for the payment you made in your electric bill to take that waste when you paid them $2 billion? They are in violation of the sanctity of that contractual commitment. So that is the story in one State, the State of Illinois. 
   But I am not through. We have a lot of charts, and we are going to go through a few. 
   The State of Michigan. They make a few automobiles out there, as I recall. We don't make automobiles in Alaska. We grow fish and trees in Alaska. The ratepayers paid $696 million into the waste fund so the Federal Government would take their waste in 1998. They have four units: Cook 1 and 2, Fermi 2, and Palisades. The waste stored is 1,493 metric tons. The DOE has research reactor waste there as well. What happens? Palisades says 1992. So they are out of luck. Fermi 2 is down in 2001, and Cook and 2 are down in 2014. Michigan is 24-percent dependent on nuclear power. 
   The next chart: Arkansas. The ratepayers in Arkansas paid $365 million to the Federal Government for the waste fund. You would think President Clinton, being from Arkansas, would have some interest in solving this problem. No way. They have two units, Arkansas 1 and 2. Waste storage is 690 metric tons. Unit 1, down in 1996; unit 2, down in 1997. What they have done is they took their waste out of the spent fuel pool, and put it on site in casks temporarily. That is where it is. The State allowed them to do that. We don't know if all the States are going to allow that. Now, mind you, that is temporary. ``Temporary'' implies you are going to do something for a permanent solution. Arkansas is 33-percent dependent on nuclear power. 
   The next chart: The State of Oregon. They paid $108 million into the waste fund. One unit, Trojan. Waste stored, 424 metric tons. It is the location of the Hanford site. Waste stored, 2,133 metric tons. Trojan closed for decommissioning. The waste stays in Oregon. If the Governor doesn't want relief, it is going to stay in Oregon. 
   Next is Louisiana. Waste fund, $239 million. That is what the ratepayers paid in Louisiana. Two units, River Bend 1 and Waterford 3. Waste stored, 567 metric tons. What is happening? In the year 2002, down goes Waterford 3, and in 2007, down goes River Bend 1. The State of Louisiana is dependent 22 percent. 
   Georgia. The waste fees that the people in Georgia paid on their rate bills total $529 million. Four units: Hatch 1 and 2 and Vogtle 1 and 2. Waste stored 1,182 metric tons. They have the 
   Savannah River site. Waste stored, 206 metric tons. It is going to stay there. Hatch is out in 1999; Vogtle out in 2008. Georgia is 30-percent dependent on nuclear energy. 
   The dairy State, Wisconsin. What bothers me here is the fact that Members from these States should be concerned. You have been ripped off by the Federal Government. They are taking your consumers' money, and they haven't taken your waste. Do you want it to stay there? If you do, don't do anything. If you want to move it, you had better get behind some legislation. Three units, Kewaunee and Point Beach 1 and 2. Waste stored, 967 metric tons. Point Beach: They are storing it in casks on the surface at the nuclear reactor. Kewaunee goes down in 2001, and Point Beach goes down in 1995. They are 8-percent dependent on nuclear power. 
   Connecticut. We haven't had much concern from Connecticut. I can't imagine why. Connecticut is 43-percent dependent on nuclear power. That is the first quarter figures for 1999. The residents, in their utility bills, have paid in $655 million for the Federal Government to take the waste. Two units, Millstone 2 and 3. Waste stored, 1,445 metric tons; DOE defense waste. They build a few nuclear subs in Connecticut. They have for a long time. Do you want us to be able to continue building those submarines? Millstone 2 is up in 2002. Millstone 3 is up in 2003. They are 43-percent nuclear dependent in Connecticut. 
   Next chart: The State of Washington, moving out near my part of the world. The waste fund contribution is $344 million. Residents paid that amount in Washington in their utility bills. The Government didn't take the waste. One unit, WNP 2. Waste stored, 292 metric tons. No vacancy in 2000. Despite the fact that they have tremendous hydro in the State of Washington, they are 6-percent dependent on nuclear.  
   Moving on to Massachusetts. The ratepayers there paid $156 million in their electric bills. One unit, Pilgrim 1. Waste stored, 495 metric tons. The State is 12-percent dependent. 
   That gives you some idea geographically of where this stuff is. It is all over the country. 
   We are trying to get consideration of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act Amendments of 1999. 
   This issue has been before this body before. We passed bills by broad bipartisan margins in previous Congresses but couldn't overcome a veto threat by our President from Arkansas. On that last vote there were 65 votes in support of the bill and 34 were opposed to it. Our President is from Arkansas. I guess he wants to leave the waste in Arkansas because he threatened to veto the bill. We didn't quite have a veto-proof vote. We only had 65 votes. That is pretty good around here. 
   Those bills were a complete substitute for the existing Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. That bill gave the authority to build an interim storage facility for nuclear waste at a temporary above-ground storage pad adjacent to Yucca Mountain. In other words, the relief proposed in that bill was to move the waste into casks that were designed and engineered for transportation and move them out to Yucca Mountain where they could be stored temporarily in above-ground storage until such time as Yucca Mountain was ready to receive the waste. 
   I have another chart that shows how high-level waste moves around the country in the transportation network. It is important that you understand this high-level waste moves across the United States today. There have been from time to time suggestions made that somehow this can't be moved safely. 
   When we show you the chart, you will recognize that there is a risk involved in moving anything, including you and I. With proper precautions and with proper engineering, the risks can be reduced dramatically. 
   That is what has been done. When one considers the risk inherent in leaving this waste where it is, scattered around the country in places where it wasn't designed to be stored, or storing it onsite in casks, one has to question why there is such a concern over moving this waste to one concentrated site as was proposed initially in the previous legislation to establish interim storage at a temporary above-ground storage pad adjacent to the Yucca Mountain site. 
   Here are 30 years of safe transportation of used-fuel routes that occurred from 1964 to 1997. There were 2,913 shipments. There is the routing. They go from Portland to San Francisco, Los Angeles, Albuquerque, Phoenix, Denver, Cheyenne, Bismark, Minneapolis, Omaha, Des Moines, St. Louis, Oklahoma City, Nashville, Columbia, Raleigh, Richmond, Washington, DC, Philadelphia, New York, Syracuse, Boston, Pittsburgh, Charleston, Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, and St. Paul. They have been moved, and they have been moved safely. 
   I think there was one accident where somebody ran off the road. No damage was done to the spent fuel cask. The inherent safety of the technology within the casks resulted in no release of radiation. Sure, something could happen. Something could happen by leaving it where it is. 
   The fact is, with these numbers of shipments over that timeframe, there has never been a fatality. There has never been an injury. There has never been any environmental damage because of carriage of this radioactive cargo. To suggest we should suddenly become excited about the prospects of moving it, fails to recognize that we have been moving it for 30 years. 
   The previous legislation contained extensive provisions on licensing for Yucca and interim storage facilities, including NEPA radiation protection standards and transportation requirements. History tells us the administration, of course, threatened to veto this legislation because it opposed interim storage, and the justification for that was that they wanted the viability assessment to have been completed regarding the permit repository 
   at Yucca Mountain. The viability assessment has been completed. So that is behind us. That is one roadblock that has been thrown in our way. 
   We have had, of course, a great deal of objection from our friends from Nevada. I can understand their objection. They don't want it in their State. Where are we going to put it? Are we going to put it in the District of Columbia, which belongs to everybody? We know the practicality of that is unrealistic. We know we have to store it somewhere. If it weren't for my friend from Nevada objecting, it would be my friend from someplace else objecting. But you can't continue to ignore the problem. 
   There is an anti-nuke movement out there that doesn't want to see any advancement of technology for anything that has anything to do with nuclear power generation. One thing they forget is what the nuclear power industry contributes to air quality. It makes the greatest contribution of any source because there are no air emissions. If you want to clean up the air, and we are concerned about global warming, nuclear is an answer. They won't have that. They want the status quo, which is doing nothing while the waste continues to pile up. 
   We are trying to accommodate the administration. We are trying to make advances so we can make progress on how we are going to address this problem. 
   In response to the administration's concern, the bill before us, Senate bill 1287, is a completely different approach. I hope my colleagues and staff who are watching this debate understand what this bill does. It is not a complete substitute for the old act. It is a minimal approach. It does not contain interim storage provisions. We have taken those out because there has been great objection to that. The reason there is great objection is because the fear is that if you put spent fuel in Nevada in interim storage it will become permanent. I do not agree with this position, but I am not going to argue the point. Nevertheless, this legislation is different. It doesn't mandate an interim storage provision. So let's get that out of the debate. 
   It is no longer in the bill. 
   There are two major things this bill does. First, it gives the Department of Energy the tools it needs to meet its commitment to move spent fuel by opening a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain. That is the policy. That is the objective. Every responsible policy-maker has agreed. We have to have an answer to this. The answer, of course, is the permanent repository at Yucca Mountain. One may not agree that is the correct answer, but we have collected over $15 billion from the ratepayers to put that waste in that hole we dug at a cost of over $7 billion at Yucca Mountain. That is our policy. We have to have some policy. Otherwise, we are going down a million rabbit trails at once. 
   The second major thing: It provides fair treatment for those who have fulfilled their end of the bargain by paying over $15 billion under the contract, only to have DOE leave them literally holding the bag. This is pursuant to the contract to take the waste in 1998, which the Federal Government failed to do. 
   Specifically, this legislation, Senate bill 1287, clarifies the existing unconstitutional one House veto for raising the nuclear waste fee. It states, I think, appropriately, that only the Congress can vote to raise the existing one mill per kilowatt fee if necessary to pay the additional expenses anticipated in this program. We are saying only the Congress has that authority. 
   The bill allows plaintiffs in the lawsuit and the Department of Energy to reach voluntary settlements of DOE's liability for failing to take nuclear waste in 1998. To accommodate Secretary Richardson, with whom I have been working at great length, we have included the administration proposal to take title to the waste at reactor sites. 
   This offers the industry an alternative. They can do one of two things: They can either let the Government take title to the waste at site or they can choose to proceed to litigate their claim for the Government for failing to take the waste. 
   There is a radiation standard that has received a lot of consideration. The question is, Who sets the standard? Should it be the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that has the extended, in-depth expertise in nuclear matters and setting standards? Should that agency set the standard that protects the people of Nevada and other States without  imposing unnecessary and counterproductive restrictions? 
   Some will argue that the regulator ought to be the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA should regulate and set the standard. Let's be sure we understand one another. That standard has to be reasonable. Otherwise, this whole thing is for naught. 
   The EPA has a rather curious record. Some suggest there are portions within the administration that don't want to have anything to do with nuclear energy; they are opposed philosophically to it. Are they going to be objective and set a standard that is unattainable on purpose? That is the real risk. This whole thing can be killed on that one issue. That has been known to happen. If they set a standard for groundwater comparable to the drinking water standard, this thing is through. The Government's money is wasted, and the $6 billion in Yucca Mountain is wasted. I know some people would love to have it that way because we wouldn't be putting it in Yucca Mountain or Nevada and we would still have the problem. 
   Be careful of this one, colleagues. The bill contains a radiation standard set by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. I am willing to take a look at other proposals as long as it will result in a rational standard. 
   The fourth issue in this new proposal is to allow the fuel to be accepted when the NRC authorizes construction of a permanent repository in the year 2007. Again, we assume that will be at Yucca Mountain. It allows the Department of Energy to begin moving fuel as soon as possible after Yucca Mountain is licensed in the 
   year 2007. 
   I appeal to those States and those Governors who are following this debate who say wait, if this proposal goes and the Government takes title, it is still stuck in my State. I remind the Governors, if this bill does not pass, it is still stuck in your State. We have to have a vehicle to move this process along. Everybody is free to come in if they can build a better mousetrap. 
   Transportation provisions based on those used for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, or WIPP, are another provision. Again, I refer to the transportation chart. We move spent fuel all the time in the United States and around the world and have no release of radiation. 
   This revised bill builds on the existing safety system by adding money for education, emergency responders, local communities, transportation personnel, provisions for routing, allowing the State input, special rules for populated areas, and advanced notification for local government. That is not what is done now by the Federal Government; they just go ahead and move it. This is civilian, government-owned and military waste. The same stuff. It moves to Idaho, moves all over the country; we just don't say anything about it. Now we are saying: OK, public, this is what we will do. Is it any less safe than what we are doing now? It will be safer if we pass S. 1287. 
   We will have an opportunity for a demonstration. Some folks will come out and have a field day. But they have an obligation, too. What will they do about this waste? Will they stand and block it so it can go back to where it came from? That is irresponsible. 
   Where is the administration? I am not sure. I talked to the Secretary. We have accommodated the Secretary. It was his proposal that said we would take the waste at site. I explained we are having problems with some of the Governors, particularly in the northeast part of the United States. They want to get this waste out of their area. They had better get behind something that will address a process so the waste can be moved, because if they don't, it will sit there forever. 
   We have eliminated the source of the administration's opposition to our previous bill on the issue of no interim storage, and on their suggestion relating to the Government taking title of the waste. I am not sure I understand whether the administration still opposes the bill, but I am sure my friends on the other side will enlighten me. They certainly have not come to the table to try to work constructively to resolve this problem which I believe we can no longer ignore. 
   I think it is the philosophy of the Clinton administration to simply ignore this for the remainder of their watch. As a consequence, it is delayed, delayed, delayed, delayed. 
   I have gone on for a reasonable period of time. I want to accommodate my colleagues. I see the Senator from Nevada waiting to be recognized, as well as some of my other colleagues. 
   Madam President has been most accommodating in allowing me this time, but I am inclined to yield the floor. This may be enough for me today, but I have about 680 more pages of material that, hopefully, will convince you, if I have not convinced you already. 
   With that, Madam President. I temporarily yield the floor.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation regarding the State of Alaska's sovereign right to manage its fish and game resources. It is a sad day that I come to the floor of the United States Senate to inform my colleagues that for the first time since Alaska became a state it no longer has sole authority to manage its fisheries on federal lands. 
   For everyone of my colleagues their respective states right to manage fish and game is absolute--every state but Alaska manages all its own fish and game. As of October 1, in Alaska, this is not the case, and therefore, action must be taken to try and provide the opportunity for the state to regain this authority back as swiftly as possible. 
   Some background is in order here. 
   When Congress passed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) in 1980, Title VIII required the State of Alaska to provide a rural subsistence hunting and fishing preference on federal ``public lands.'' If the State fails to provide the required preference by State statute, the law provided that the federal government would step in to manage the subsistence uses of fish and game resources on federal lands. 
   The Alaska State Legislature passed such a subsistence preference law in 1978 which was upheld by referendum in 1982. The law was slightly revised in 1986, and remained on the books until it was struck down by the Alaska Supreme Court in 1989 as unconstitutional because of the Alaska Constitution's common use of fish and game clause. It is easy to see how there would be a conflict between a federal law that requires the state to provide a preference for rural Alaskans for fish and game resources and a state constitution that provides for equal access. When the state statutes were struck down, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture, for Forest Service lands, took over management of fish and game resources on federal public lands in Alaska. 
   For the most part the early focus was on game management and little was done to impact Alaska's fisheries. That all changed in 1995 when a decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Katie John v. United States extended the law far beyond its original scope to apply not just to ``federal lands'' but to navigable waters owned by the State of Alaska. Hence State and private lands were impacted too. The theory espoused by the Court was that the ``public lands'' includes navigable 
   waters in which the United States has reserved water rights. If implemented, the courts decision would mean all fisheries in Alaska could effectively be managed by the federal government. In April of 1996, the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture published an ``Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking'' which identified about half of the state as subject to federal authority to regulate fishing activities. 
   These regulations were so broad they could have affected not only fishing activities, but virtually all activities on state and federal lands that may have an impact on subsistence uses. There is no precedent in any other State in the Union for this kind of overreaching into State management prerogatives. For that reason Congress acted in 1996 to place a moratorium on the federal government from implementing those regulations and assuming control of Alaska's fisheries. This moratorium was provided mainly to allow the State time to make appropriate changes to the constitution and relevant statutes in order to comply with the federal law. The moratorium was extended three times by Congress and just recently expired October 1, 1999. 
   The Governor, and the majority of the State legislators have worked to try and resolve this issue by adopting an amendment to the State constitution that would allow them to pass State statutes to come into compliance with the federal law and provide a subsistence priority. Unfortunately, the State of Alaska's Constitution is not easily amended and these efforts have fallen short of the necessary votes needed to place the issue before the Alaska voters. In fact, in the most recent special session a majority of the legislators voted to do just this. Unfortunately they were just two votes shy in the State Senate of the 2/3 majority needed to place the necessary amendment before the voters. 
   With the failure of the legislature to place a constitutional amendment on the ballot prior to October 1, 1999, we now find ourselves in a situation where the federal government has assumed control of subsistence fisheries in Alaska. Therefore, absent a lawsuit or major change to federal law, the only way the State can now regain management of the subsistence fisheries is if the Secretary were to certify that the citizens of Alaska voted on, and approved, a constitutional amendment and the State Legislature had approved appropriate State statutes to conform with ANILCA. Under the most optimistic circumstances, the absolute earliest this could occur would be after the general election in November of 2000--and more likely it would not occur until 2001 or 2002. This just cannot be allowed to continue without some effort to return management to Alaska as soon as possible.  
   The proposal I am introducing today would minimize the duration of federal control if the State legislature passes a constitutional amendment that would allow them to adopt laws to come into compliance with the federal law. This would continue to make sure the focus of a resolve remains on State action and not in the ill-placed hopes of some action by Congress. 
   Specifically, the proposal would do the following: 
   Provide that the State can regain management authority as soon as the Secretary certifies the State legislature has approved a constitutional amendment that would 
   allow the State to comply with ANILCA. 
   As soon as the Secretary certifies the amendment, any unexpended funds that were provided to the Secretary as a result of the legislature's failure to act by October 1, 1999 are turned over to the State. 
   In order to continue to retain management the State must place the amendment on the ballot at the earliest date possible under State law. 
   The Secretary could manage subsistence again if the amendment is not adopted by the voters or if it is adopted but the State fails to adopt the needed state statutes at the end of the first legislative session after passage of the constitutional amendment. 
   At any time that the Secretary is managing subsistence fisheries in Alaska, he must comply with section 1308 of ANILCA which requires local hire. 
   Mr. President, I along with most Alaskans, believe that subsistence uses of fish and game should have a priority over other uses in the State. We have provided for such uses in the past, I have hunted and fished under those regulations and I respected and supported them and continue to do so now. I believe the State can again provide for such uses without significant interruption to the sport or commercial fisherman. 
   I also believe that Alaska's rural residents should play a greater role in the management and enforcement of fish and game laws in Alaska. They understand and live with the resources in rural Alaska. They see and experience the fish and game resources day in and day out. And, they are most directly impacted by the decisions made about use of those resources. They should bear their share of the responsibility for formulating fish and game laws as well as enforcing them. 
   It is my intention to ensure that at anytime the Secretary is managing any of Alaska's wildlife resources that he maximize the expertise of Alaska's Native people. I also hope the State would provide Alaska's rural residents a greater role as it seeks to resolve the subsistence dilemma once and for all. But until that happens, I cannot stand by and watch the federal government move into the State and assume control of the Alaska fish and game resources for an extended period of time. That is why I am providing for the earliest opportunity for the State to regain management. 
   I've lived under federal management during Alaska's territorial days and it does not work. In 1959 Alaskan's caught just 25.1 million salmon. Under State management we caught 218 million salmon in 1995. 
   Federal control would again be a disaster for the resource and those that depend on it.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, when I first came to this body in the Congress that convened in January of 1981, I was the 100th Senator. There is no question about that. There is a certain degree of humility associated with that prized and coveted position. 
   As a consequence of the reality that we came in with 16 other Republican  Senators in what was somewhat of a revolution associated with President Reagan, some suggested we came in on his coattails. Those of us who prided ourselves on our accomplishment were not ready to attribute totally that responsibility to President Reagan, but nonetheless we were fortunate to be here. 
   In the determination of how this place works, as a freshman Senator, one quickly has an opportunity to participate in the selection of committees. Being the 100th Senator, you take what is left and what you get. I found myself having perhaps made the choice, but clearly with the realization that while my first choice was the Finance Committee, my realistic choice was the Environment and Public Works Committee. At that time, Senator Chafee had taken over the chairmanship of that. 
   One of the interesting reflections is not too many of the Republicans, in spite of their seniority, knew what chairmanships were all about because it had been a long dry spell in the Senate --several decades. 
   In any event, I had an opportunity to serve with the late Senator John Chafee. As a junior member of that committee, I was quickly immersed in the technical aspects of such issues as emissions, NO  
   X, CO 
   2, clean water, clean air, the role of the Environmental Protection Agency, and a host of other eventualities that suggested that clearly there was an institutional memory associated with many of these issues. I found, much to my relief, that the late Senator Chafee was a patient, caring, and intensely dedicated Member of this body. I know many Members have discussed his military role, his individual and personal sacrifice on behalf of our Nation in serving. Having dedicated his life to public service, I think it is a reflection of the type of American and unique Senator he was. 
   During that time on his committee, I was privileged to participate in significant events that were charged to his responsibility. Looking back on those instances, they were really opportunities to get to know and understand and appreciate the contribution Senator John Chafee made to the Senate. 
   Later, I had an opportunity to serve with him on the Republican health care task force. Even later, finally, after some 14 years in this body, I did get my first choice of committees, the Senate Finance Committee. John Chafee was on that committee as a senior member. John took over an obligation to coordinate the Republican health task force. John studied in depth the details of health care. He probably knew them better than anyone in this body. He cared very deeply about bettering the lives of those he met. I remember the morning meetings when he went into great depth on the health care issue and how we could meet our obligations to provide reasonable health care for the Nation. It was a disputed area of concern relative to a certain amount of partisanship, which occasionally raises its head around here. Nevertheless, John was above that; he was dedicated and committed to trying to accomplish something meaningful in that area. He never gave up, as he didn't on many of the issues about which he cared so deeply. 
   So as we look at John's desk and the flowers that adorn it, it is with fond memories that we think of a fine American and an outstanding Senator with whom we were privileged to serve for a number of years--in my own case, for some 19 years. I treasure that time with John Chafee. I shall miss his contribution to this body. We had certain disagreements from time to time on issues, as Senators do in this body, but I always respected where he stood. I always knew where he was coming from. He was a gentleman whose word was his bond. 
   Coincidentally, recently I made a telephone call to a friend who has been ill for some time. He was known to many in this body. The gentlemen's name is Duffy Wall. He was a friend to many Members of this body. Duffy Wall passed away yesterday, as well, at about 4:15 in the morning. I talked to his wife Sharon, who was kind enough to phone me and advise me that Duffy had passed on. It was kind of memorable that, in her reflection, she said, ``You know, Frank, Duffy was a great friend of John Chafee's.'' She believed that Duffy wanted to go with Senator Chafee. So wherever the two are today, obviously, they have affection and great friendship. As Senators, we suffer the loss of our dear friend John Chafee. I thought it fitting to add that there was another dear friend of ours and John Chafee's who also passed away yesterday morning. 
   Mr. President, I extend to Mrs. Chafee and her family my sincere sympathy. I also extend to Sharon and the Wall family our sympathy for the loss of Duffy Wall. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill to solve a problem unique to Alaska. The city of Craig is located in the far southeastern part of Alaska on Price of Wales Island, the third largest island in the country. Craig is unlike any other small town or village in Alaska. It has no land base upon which to maintain its local services, and no ability to utilize many federal programs which are dependent upon a large Alaska Native population for eligibility. 
   Nevertheless, the community has grown from a mostly Native population of 250 in 1971 to over 2,500 residents, most of whom are not Alaska Natives. Despite this, the town is surrounded by land selections from two different Alaska village corporations. In fact, 93 percent of the land within the Craig city limits is owned by these village corporations. Under federal law passed in 1987, none of the village land is subject to taxation so long as the land is not developed. The city of Craig has only 300 acres of land owned privately by individuals within its city limits to serve as it municipal tax base. It can annex no other land because the entire land base outside its municipal boundaries is owned by the federal government as part of the Tongass National Forest or other Alaska Native corporation. 
   Craig's demands for municipal services increase every year as costs go up and population increases. According to the State of Alaska, Craig is the fastest growing first class city in the state. Since its large non-Native majority population make the town and its residents largely ineligible for federal programs which service virtually all other ANSCA villages, it has requested a small conveyance of 4,532 acres of federal land located not far from the town. That land entitlement would permit the city to develop a land base upon which it could support its increasing demand for municipal services. 
   The land base which is included in this bill has been carefully chosen. It is less than 20 miles from the city and abuts the existing road system. It is the first available land from the city limits not owned by an Alaska native corporation. The land will complete a sound management system by providing municipal ownership of land adjacent to both existing private and state owned land. It will be a good use of this land which is nowhere near any environmentally sensitive lands such as wilderness areas. This part of Prince of Wales Island has roads, communities and other developed sites near it. There will be no land use conflicts created by this conveyance. 
   Mr. President, my bill provides a direct grant of 4,532 acres to the city. While I looked at a land exchange, the city has no land to trade. The city received no municipal entitlement because the Forest Service never agreed to any land selection by the State of Alaska in this part of Prince of Wales Island. The only substantial land near Craig besides the actual 300 acres on which Craig sits is owned by the federal government in the national forest or by Alaska Native corporations. 
   I intend to hold a hearing on this bill early in the next session, and begin the process to move the bill through the Senate to final passage in the Congress.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Senator from Texas, as well as the Senators from New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Louisiana who have all been steadfast in their desire and commitment to ensuring a royalty valuation process that is fair to both the American taxpayer and to domestic producers. As was spelled out in the report accompanying this conference agreement, the GAO, at a minimum, must thoroughly examine and answer several central issues and answer several key questions. Among those questions the GAO must fully answer are: 
   1. Does the OCSLA and the MLLA require that a producer pay royalty on the value added by post-production downstream activities? 
   2. Does the Interior Department proposed rule allow royalty payors to obtain timely valuation methodology determinations on which they can rely similar to the practice of Internal Revenue Service letter rulings? 
   3. Does the proposed rule provide that the ``gross proceeds'' method utilized in valuation of arms-length transactions can not be later set aside for an alternative methodology (resulting in penalties and interest) simply because another entity was able to obtain a higher value for the sale of production in the open marketplace?

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I rise today to congratulate Senator GORTON on his good work on the fiscal year 2000 Interior appropriations bill. I know the negotiations which led to this conference report were difficult but I believe Senator GORTON and the other Senate conferees did an excellent job under these trying circumstances. I hope that President Clinton recognizes this and signs this appropriations bill into law. 
   Today, I want to highlight one particular program which has been the subject of recent focus both in the Congress and in the Clinton Administration--the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The LWCF Act authorizes the expenditure of monies from the LWCF for two purposes only: the acquisition of Federal land by the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the United States Forest Service; and formula grants to states for park and recreation projects. The LWCF Act creates a balance--between the State and local communities and the Federal government; between urban and rural communities; between the western and eastern states--for the development of outdoor recreation resources. 
   Unfortunately, over the last four years the balance between the state and Federal-sides of the LWCF has been eliminated. With the action of the Clinton Administration and the Congress to shut-down the state-side LWCF matching grant program in fiscal year 1996, the LWCF has become a Federal-only land acquisition program. As I have expressed before, I believe the loss of this balance is a tragic mistake and serves to increase the already significant pressure on the Federal government to meet the recreation demands of the American public. 
   I have worked tirelessly over the last 3 years to restore the state-side LWCF matching grant program. This year those efforts have reaped results. Interior conferees provided $20 million for the state-side matching grant program. While I wish more money could have been provided, with tough budget targets, it was not easy to find $20 million in such a lean bill. It is a start. 
   I also would like to thank Senator GORTON for ensuring that no limitations are placed on the expenditure of this money. It is important that States and local governments have the flexibility to determine how best to meet the recreation needs of their citizens. 
   There may be a need for changes to the state-wide LWCF matching grant program. However, it is not appropriate to make these changes on an appropriations bill. The President's budget proposal sought to fundamentally restructure the state-side matching grant program authorized by the LWCF Act. The LWCF state-side program is a formula grant program which provides monies to States and local communities for the planning, acquisition, and development of parks and recreation facilities. The President proposed to replace this program with a competitive grant program to the States for the purchase of land and open space planning. This proposal would have changed the focus of the state-side program and undercut the Federalism inherent in the existing program. The Federal government should not dictate a one-size fits all mandate for the administration of this program. 
   State-side LWCF matching grants, which address the highest priority needs of Americans for outdoor recreation, have helped finance well over 37,500 park and recreation projects throughout the United States. The state-side of the LWCF has played a vital role in providing recreational and educational opportunities to millions of Americans. The state-side program has worked because it has provided States and local communities--not the Federal government--with the flexibility to determine how best to meet the recreational needs of its residents. This $20 million will begin the process of saving this important program. 
   The Interior conference report also provides more than $230 million for land acquisition by the four Federal land management agencies including $40 million for the acquisition of Baca Ranch in New Mexico. A few months ago the President announced an agreement to purchase this property for $101 million. I have not taken a position on the merits of the Baca Ranch acquisition but have an interest in this matter as chairman of the authorizing committee. 
   No money can be appropriated from the Land and Water Conservation Fund for the acquisition of Federal land, including Baca Ranch, in the absence of an authorization. The Federal-side LWCF program provides monies for the Federal land management agencies to acquire lands otherwise authorized for acquisition. The LWCF Act does not provide an independent basis for Federal land acquisition. Rather, the LWCF Act establishes a funding mechanism for the acquisition of Federal lands which have been separately authorized. Section 7 of the statute specifies, with limited exceptions, that LWCF monies cannot be used 
   for a Federal land purchase ``unless such acquisition is otherwise authorized by law.'' 
   The Interior conference report recognizes this limitation by making the acquisition of the Baca Ranch contingent  on the enactment of authorizing legislation. No matter what the fate of the Interior appropriations bill this contingency must be included. It is bad public policy to disregard the terms of the LWCF Act and expend this significant amount of money for the purchase of additional Federal property absent a thorough, and open, public review. This review can be best done in the authorizing committee. I want to thank Senator GORTON, who sits on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, for recognizing the need for specific authorizing legislation and including this contingency. 
   The Interior conference report also requires that the General Accounting Office review and report on the Baca Ranch appraisal. The Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Act requires an appraisal of the fair market value of private property the Federal government desires to acquire, whether through negotiations or condemnation. An appraisal has been done on the Baca Ranch. However, the appraisal was conducted not by the Federal government but rather the seller. While I have no reason to doubt the validity of the appraisal, before Congress spends this significant amount of money to purchase the Baca Ranch, Congress owes it to the American taxpayer to ensure that the $101 million sale price represents the actual fair market value of the property. The General Accounting Office is the appropriate entity to conduct this review and report to the appropriators and the authorizers. 
   As many of us remember from two years ago, the conditions imposed on the Baca Ranch purchase are consistent with the requirements the Senate imposed on the Headwaters Forest and New World Mine purchases. Unfortunately, these conditions were eliminated in conference and both acquisitions were authorized on the fiscal year 1998 Interior appropriations bill. That is wrong. Clearly by agreeing to placing these limitations on the Baca Ranch acquisition, the House has realized that authorizing, the Headwaters Forest and New World Mine acquisitions in the appropriations bill was bad public policy. It is the role of the authorizing committee--not the appropriators--to make sure that any addition to the Federal estate is warranted. 
   There has been talk about the next step in the process. There are rumors that the President will not sign this conference report because he is disappointed that his Lands Legacy proposal was not totally funded. I hope that is not true but if it is I find this reasoning nonsensical. The Lands Legacy proposal is nothing but budget gimmicky. It seeks to charge against the $900 million LWCF ceiling the increased funding of a variety of programs not authorized to derived monies from the LWCF. These programs, which may or may not warrant increased Federal funding, already have independent authorizations. By engaging in this accounting game, the President artificially reduces the amounts available for programs authorized by the LWCF Act, including the state-side matching grant program. If the President seeks to fund these programs from the LWCF, he needs to introduce appropriate authorizing legislation and work with the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to accomplish this goal. 
   Finally--and most disturbing to me as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee--are indications that the Clinton Administration wants to permanently authorize the use of revenues from the Outer Continental Shelf for the Lands Legacy proposal in either the Interior appropriations bill or an omnibus appropriations bill. I support the use of OCS revenues as a permanent funding source for a variety of important conservation programs, in fact I introduced S. 25, the Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1999, to accomplish this goal. 
   However, no matter how strong my support is for this goal, providing this authorization on any appropriations bill is wrong. This proposition is extremely controversial. In the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, we have held hearing after hearing on S. 25 and other OCS revenue sharing proposals. Since completion of those hearings, committee members have struggled to reach a compromise. We have struggled because, while every committee member cares about the conservation of this nation's natural resources, we each have a different vision as to how best to conserve and protect these resources. But no matter how difficult this challenge, we will continue to strive to reach an agreement that is acceptable not only to the Energy and Natural Resources Committee but also to the Senate. 
   What the Clinton administration is contemplating would be a unrivaled usurpation of the authorizing committees. If the most significant piece of conservation legislation introduced in the last 30 years is enacted on an appropriations bill without any public input or participation, all of us who are authorizers should turn in our gavels.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the Senate will soon exercise its constitutional duty of ``advice and consent'' for international treaties. This is a solemn task. And the treaty before us, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty or ``CTBT,'' relates to an issue of utmost importance, the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
   As I have evaluated this treaty, I have kept one question first and foremost in my mind: Will ratification of this treaty by the United States serve to protect the national security of the United States? And after careful consideration, my position is that the CTBT weakens the national security of the United States, and I will therefore oppose ratification. 
   Although I support the lofty goals of the Test Ban Treaty--preventing the spread of nuclear weapons--I think only the good guys will play by the rules. Test ban advocates argue that setting a good example will lead others to play by the rules. The United States has not tested a bomb since 1992, but India and Pakistan went ahead with testing bombs, despite U.S. sanctions and condemnation. 
   Test Ban advocates also argue that the threat of sanctions will keep countries in line. As my colleagues will recall, North Korea violated the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty--in fact, are still violating the NPT--and the Clinton Administration has rewarded the  DPRK with aid, and more recently, with the removal of sanctions. I suspect the same pattern if rogue nations like North Korea even ratify the CTBT. 
   But even more fundamentally, I believe this zero-yield treaty of unlimited duration fundamentally threatens the United States' nuclear deterrent by preventing nuclear testing essential to maintaining the safety and reliability of our nuclear stockpile. Our nuclear weapons are the most sophisticated designs in the world, yet over time, the nuclear materials and high explosives triggers deteriorate, and we lack the experience in predicting the effects of these changes. 
   According to expert testimony, one-third of all weapons designs introduced into the nuclear weapons stockpile since 1985 have required and received post-deployment nuclear tests to resolve problems. In three-fourths of these cases, the problems were discovered only because of on-going nuclear tests. In each case, the weapons were thought to be reliable and thoroughly tested. 
   How confident can we be in the reliability of our nuclear stockpile if we are unable to test these weapons to determine the degradation effects of aging? If we cannot be confident in our own weapons' effectiveness, what do you suppose other nations will conclude? The use of nuclear weapons as a deterrent is only effective when other parties believe in their capability as well. 
   Although the Stockpile Stewardship Program should be pursued, we must remember that the Program is in its infancy. Deciding in 1999 to rely on an untested program that will be operational in 2010 is reckless. In the future, I hope that nuclear tests can be replaced by computer simulations and laboratory-based experiments. But I am not willing to bet my grandchildren's security on it. 
   In light of hearings this past year before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee on Chinese espionage allegations, I also am not comfortable placing the results of our nuclear testing in the memory banks of the National Labs' computers which are vulnerable to espionage or sabotage. 
   Finally, I would like to address the problem of verifying other nations' compliance with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Recent reports from the intelligence community indicate that we are unable to monitor low- level nuclear tests precisely enough to distinguish between a conventional explosion, a low-level nuclear test, or even natural seismic activity. The United States cannot now, and may not in the foreseeable future, be able to confidently detect and identify militarily significant nuclear tests of one kiloton or less. That is roughly 500 times the size of the blast which destroyed the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City. 
   Twice last month Russia carried out what might have been nuclear explosions at its Novaya Zemlya testing site in the Arctic. It was reported that U.S. surveillance satellites have repeatedly observed the kind of activity that usually precedes and follows a low-level nuclear test. Yet, data from the CIA's seismic sensors and other monitoring equipment were reportedly insufficient to reach a firm conclusion as to the true nature of the explosions. If it is not possible to confirm tests such as these, how are we going to verify that countries such as Russia and China are complying with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty? 
   Mr. President, this Treaty is not in the national interest and I urge my colleagues to reject its ratification.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation that would make technical changes to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA). 
   As my colleagues know, ANCSA was enacted in 1971 stimulated by the need to address Native land claims as well as the desire to clear the way for the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and thereby provide our country with access to the petroleum resources of Alaska's North Slope. This landmark piece of legislation is a breathing, living, document that often needs to be attended for Alaska Natives to receive its full benefits. This body has amended the Act many times including this Congress. 
   This bill has nine provisions. One provision would allow common stock to be willed to adopted-out descendants. Another provision would clarify the liability for contaminated lands in Alaska. The clarification of contaminated land would declare that no person acquiring interest in land under this Act shall be liable for the costs of removal or remedial action, any damages, or any third party liability arising out or as a result of any contamination on that land at the time the land was acquired. 
   In 1917, the Norton Bay Reservation was established on 350,000 acres of land located on the north side of Norton Bay southeast of Nome, Alaska, for the benefit of Alaska Natives who now reside in the village of Elim, Alaska. The purpose of the establishment of the reservation included providing a land, economic, subsistence, and resources base for the people of that area. 
   In 1929, through an Executive Order, 50,000 acres of land were deleted from the reservation with little consultation and certainly without the informed consent of the people who were to be most affected by such a deletion. After passage of ANCSA, only the remaining  300,000 acres of the original reservation were conveyed to the Elim Native Corporation. This loss of land from the original reservation has become over the years a festering wound to the people of Elim. It now needs to be healed through the restoration or replacement of the deleted fifty thousand acres of land to the Native Village Corporation authorized by ANCSA to hold such land. 
   Section 5 of the bill amends the Act further to allow equal access to Alaska Native veterans who served in the military or other armed services during the Vietnam War. I want to spend a moment speaking about this provision in particular, Mr. President, because I feel a great injustice 
   has occurred and the current Administration has turned its back to these dedicated American veterans. 
   Under the Native Allotment Act, Alaska Natives were allowed to apply for lands which they traditionally used as fish camps, berry picking camps or hunting camps. However, many of our Alaska Natives answered the call to duty and served in the services during the Vietnam War and were unable to apply for their native allotment. This provision allows them to apply for their native allotments and would expand the dates to include the full years of the Vietnam War. The original dates recommended by the Administration only allowed the dates January 1, 1969 to December 31, 1971. Our Alaska Native veterans should not be penalized for serving during the entire dates of the Vietnam conflict. This provision corrects that inequity by expanding the dates to reflect all the years of the Vietnam War--August 5, 1964 to May 7, 1975. 
   Mr. President, Alaska Natives have faithfully answered the call of duty when asked to serve in the armed services. In fact, American Indians and Alaska Natives generally have the highest record of answering the call to duty. Where their needs are concerned I believe we should be inclusive, not exclusive. What this Administration has done to deny them their rights is shameful. Unfortunately, their treatment of Alaska Native Veterans is reflective of their treatment of Alaska Natives in general. 
   As I am sure my colleagues will agree, the history of our Nation reflects many examples of injustices to Native Americans. As hearings will confirm, this issue calls out to be sensibly remedied and can be with relative ease as outlined in this section of the bill. 
   I plan on holding a hearing on this legislation at the earliest possible opportunity.

<TEXT>
    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President. This morning I rise to introduce legislation to implement a settlement agreement between the Chugach Alaska Corporation (CAC) and the United States Forest Service. This legislation will fulfill a long overdue commitment of the Federal government made to certain Alaska Natives. 
   I am terribly troubled and disappointed that Congress must once again step in to secure promises to Alaska Natives that at best have been unnecessarily delayed by this Administration and at worst have been trampled by them. 
   This legislation will accomplish three goals: 
   It will direct the Secretary of Agriculture to, not later than 90 days after enactment, grant CAC the access rights they were granted under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. 
   It will return to CAC cemetery and historical sites they are entitled to under section 14(h)(1) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. 
   It will require the Secretary of Agriculture to coordinate the development, maintenance, and revision of land and resource management plans for units of the National Forest System in Alaska with the plans of Alaska Native Corporations for the utilization of their lands which are intermingled with, adjacent to, or dependent for access upon National Forest System lands. 
   BACKGROUND
   Pursuant to section 1430 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA), the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the State of Alaska, and the CAC, were directed to study land ownership in and around the Chugach Region in Alaska. The purpose of this study was twofold. The first purpose was to provide for a fair and just settlement of the Chugach people and realizing the intent, purpose, and promise of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act by CAC. The second purpose was to identify lands that, to the maximum extent possible, are of like kind and character to those that were traditionally used and occupied by the Chugach people and, to the maximum extent possible, those that provide access to the coast and are economically viable. 
   On September 17, 1982, the parties entered into an agreement now known as the 1982 Chugach Natives, Inc. Settlement Agreement that set forth a fair and just settlement for the Chugach people pursuant to the study directed by Congress. Among the many provisions of this agreement the United States was required to convey to CAC not more than 73,308 acres of land in the vicinity of Carbon Mountain. The land eventually conveyed contained significant amounts of natural resources that were inaccessible by road. A second major provision of the Settlement Agreement granted CAC rights-of-way across Chugach National Forest to their land and required the United States to also grant an easement for the purpose of constructing and using roads and other facilities necessary for development of that tract of land on terms and conditions to be determined in accordance with the Settlement Agreement. It is obvious that without such an easement the land conveyed to CAC could not be utilized or developed in a manner consistent with the intent of Congress as expressed in ANILCA and ANCSA. 
   More than seventeen years after the Settlement Agreement was signed the much needed easement still has not been granted and CAC remains unable to make economic use of their lands. It seems absurd to me that Congress passed a Settlement Act for the Benefit of Alaska Natives; then the federal government entered into a Settlement Agreement to implement that Act where the CAC was concerned; and today, we find ourselves once again in a position of having to force the government to comply with these agreements. 
   I have spoken directly to the Chugach Forest Supervisor, the Regional Forester, and to the Chief of the Forest Service about this issue. Just last month I facilitated a meeting between the Forest Service and CAC to work out final details. While the parties thought they had an agreement in principle it fell apart once it reached Washington, D.C. Therefore, I find it necessary to once again have Congress rectify inaction on behalf of the Forest Service. 
   It is my intent to hold a hearing on this issue in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee as soon as possible.

<TEXT>
    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation to make technical amendments to the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA). 
   This legislation is a Rural Alaska Bill of Rights. 
   This legislation is the direct result of no less than six hearings I have held on this issue since becoming chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. 
   During these hearings I was continuously assured by the administration that many of the frustrations Alaskans face because of the interpretation of ANILCA could be dealt with administratively. Unfortunately, many of the problems remain unresolved today. 
   Some background on this issue is appropriate. 
   Nineteen years ago Congress enacted ANILCA placing more than 100 million acres of land out of 365 into a series of vast parks, wildlife refuges, and wilderness units. 
   Much of the concern about the act was the impact these Federal units, and related management restrictions, would have on traditional activities and lifestyles of the Alaskan people. 
   To allay these concerns, ANILCA included a series of unique provisions designed to ensure that traditional activities and lifestyles would continue, and that Alaskans would not be subjected to a ``Permit Lifestyle,'' as the  senior Senator from Alaska has often said. 
   It is for these reasons that ANILCA is often called ``compromise legislation'' and indeed it was--part of the compromise was that lands would be placed in CSU's and the other part was that Alaskans would be granted certain rights with regard to access and use in these units. 
   These rights were not only granted to the individuals that live in Alaska but were designed to allow the State itself to play a major role in the planning and use of these areas. 
   However, the Federal Government has not lived up to its end of the bargain--many of the Federal managers seem to have lost sight of these important representations to the people of Alaska, specifically on issues such as access across these areas and use in them. 
   Federal managers no longer recognize the crucial distinction between managing units surrounded by millions of people in the Lower 48 and vast multi-million acre units encompassing just a handful of individuals and communities in Alaska. 
   The result is the creation of the exact ``permit lifestyle'' which we were promised would never happen. 
   The delegation and other Members of this body warned this could be the case when the legislation passed. 
   As one Member of this body noted in the Senate report on this bill:  
   This Piece of Legislation, if enacted will prove to be the most important legislation ever affecting Alaska ..... While we in Congress may be reading the provisions one way ..... regulatory tools are all laid out in the bill to give rise to future bureaucratic nightmare for the people of Alaska ..... Frankly, I am expecting the worst ..... the use of massive conservation system unit designations to block exploration, development, and recreation of these lands and on adjacent non-federal lands.  
   How prophetic! 
   The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources has held extensive hearings in Alaska on the implementation of ANILCA in Anchorage, Wrangell and Fairbanks. 
   In these hearings we have heard from nearly 100 witnesses--representing every possible interest group. 
   Four clear themes have emerged from those hearings: 
   Federal agencies have failed to honor the promises made to Alaskans when ANILCA was passed into law; 
   Agencies are not providing prior and existing right holders with reasonable use and access in the exercise of their property right; 
   Agency personnel manage Alaska wilderness areas and conservation units the same way that similar units are being managed in the Lower 48--contrary to the intent of Congress; and 
   Agencies, while stating their willingness to address complaints, fail to act in a reasonable and timely fashion when it comes to dealing with specific issues. 
   Some of the specific issues identified include such absurdities as: 
   Indivdiuals and corporations are asked to pay hundreds-of-thousands of dollars to do an EIS for access to their own properties when none is required by law. 
   Millions of acres of public lands are closed to recreationists without ever having identified a resource threat. 
   When a tree falls on somebody's cabin or a bear destroys it Federal regulators will not let a person make reasonable repairs. 
   At field hearings the administration asked for time to address these problems--we gave them time--and little has happened. 
   We have not ``jumped'' to a legislative solution, rather we have acknowledged that oversight has failed to produce meaningful administrative change. 
   Does it make sense that: 
   When land managers are assigned to Alaska they are not required to have any formal ANILCA training? 
   When a tree falls on somebody's cabin or a bear destroys it that Federal regulators will not let a person make reasonable repairs. 
   People are told they will have to pay ridiculous sums of money to access their inholdings? 
   The answer to all these questions is clearly no. These are some of the problems that have to be resolved and are included in this legislation.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, my purpose in coming to the floor today is to tell you about an extraordinary Alaskan family. And to pay tribute to a mother who took from her immigrant heritage and from her adopted Alaskan home, the courage and tenacity to excel at a time when successful women were not the norm and too often uncelebrated. Her name is Mary Mikami Rouse. She died August 7th at the age of 87. 
   Her story begins in Japan with the arrival of a fifth son in the Mikami family in 1864. Shortly after the birth of Mary's father, Goro Mikami, Japan began a period of social and political revolution and tempestuous change. The Shogunate lost power and Japan's imperial house was restored to a position of prestige and authority. The feudal system was eroding and there was a remarkable degree of westernization in all areas of Japanese life. 
   Goro Mikami's father was a vassal of the Shogun, an admiral who was ultimately responsible for a navy failure that contributed to the subsequent loss of power by the Shogun. His sense of honor demanded he commit seppuku, or suicide for that loss. Fortuitously, the emperor stopped him from that action, pardoned him and made him the head of the country's new naval academy. In that position he got to know a number of American naval officers. 
   As the fifth son to a family that was Samurai, or part of the aristocracy, Goro Mikami made a decision that reflected the changing times in which he found himself. He rebelled against an arranged marriage that was in the offing and he and a friend, who were studying in Tokyo around 1885, decided to head for the American West. Plans went awry and the friend stayed behind, but Mikami took the ship to a new life. He settled in San Francisco where at some point he attended the University of California at Berkeley to learn English. Two of his brothers went on to serve in Japan's diplomatic corps. The family name was Kondo, Goro was given the last name of Mikami in order to rescue a branch of the family that was dying out--not unusual in Japanese culture. 
   Rumor says Mikami was drawn to the goldfields in Alaska, and there is some evidence he may have worked as a civilian aboard a U.S. Coast Guard Cutter. By this time, he had Americanized his name from Goro to George. But whatever his adventures, Mikami made a monumental decision in 1910, to take a trip back to Japan. His school friend had become a famous lawyer in the intervening years, and put together a huge homecoming for Mikami. At the homecoming events he met Min&#233; Morioka, who had served as a nurse in the Russian Japanese War. They married and returned to the States in 1911, this time to Seattle. In 1912, Mary Mikami was born. 
   About 1915, the family, including Mary's younger sister Alice, moved to Seward, Alaska. It appears George found work on the Alaskan railroad then being constructed between Seward and Anchorage. That same year, Mary's brother Harry was born. By 1918, the family had moved on to Anchorage where they opened George's Tailor Shop on Fourth avenue between ``B'' and ``C" Streets. Flora was born in 1919, and the family was complete. The Mikamis were either the first or one of the first Japanese families to settle in Anchorage. 
   Prior to the 1940s, Anchorage's population never moved above 2,000. Alaska was still a territory and not a stopping ground for the faint of heart. It was peopled with pioneers and adventurers seeking wealth, anonymity or a new way of life. The Mikami family persevered and prospered in this still rough and tumble atmosphere. They met the challenges of a new business, a young family, assimilating into a different culture and mastering a new language. 
   The second daughter Alice Mikami Snodgrass, who still lives in Palmer, Alaska, remembers her mother as a strict disciplinarian. She recalls the lure of swing-sets and seesaws and clamoring 
   friends, while her mother kept the Mikami kids inside until they finished their schoolwork. Even in summer, there were sums to do and chores before play. 
   In Japanese tradition, children were kept at home until they were five and then sent to school. Up to that point, the Mikami children spoke Japanese. Mary's relatives explain that she was highly traumatized when she entered school and realized she had to learn English. 
   But Mary's mother's dedication to her children's scholarship resulted in all four children being named valedictorian of their respective graduating classes in Anchorage's public high school. Mary Mikami took the honors first and subsequently attended the Alaska Agricultural College and School of Mines in Fairbanks. She graduated with highest honors in 1934. The next year the College was renamed the University of Alaska at Fairbanks. Her sister Alice recalls that Doctor Charles E. Bunnell, the first President of the University, at the time literally came to the towns, visited with the families, and recruited students by bringing along a University basketball team to play the local high school and community teams. 
   After graduating, Mary joined an anthropological expedition jointly sponsored by the college and the Department of the Interior to St. Lawrence Island, located in the windswept Bering Sea between Alaska and Siberia. The expedition studied Alaskan prehistory. She was the only woman on the team; another team member, Roland Snodgrass, was to become her brother-in-law. 
   After the expedition, she went to work for the University of Alaska Museum and was considering graduate school, perhaps at Columbia University. Instead, she met Froelich G. Rainey, a Yale graduate who became the head of the Museum. He influenced her to go to Yale instead and helped her make connections there. The intrepid Mary left Alaska for the first time in her young life and took the steamer to Seattle and then the train across country to a different challenge--a new world. Like her mother and father before her, she entered a new life with few connections to the past, and no one to greet her and ease the transition. 
   She adapted and continued her success. She met and married fellow graduate student Irving Rouse. Both received Ph.D's and remained at Yale for lifelong careers of learning and teaching. Mary Mikami Rouse was a visiting lecturer, an editor of translations, instruction assistant at the Institute of Oriental Languages and a research assistant. She also served as an editorial assistant for American Antiquity, Journal of the Society for American Archaeology. Her husband, now retired, was the editor of that journal and is a well known anthropologist specializing in the Caribbean. 
   Back in Alaska, her brother and sisters followed her to the University of  Alaska and brother Harry also received a Ph.D from Yale. Sister Alice married Roland Snodgrass who later served as Director of the Division of Agriculture in Gov. Walter Hickel's first administration. Their son Jack is an attorney in Palmer. Mary's youngest sister, Flora Mikami Newcomb lives in Vancouver, B.C. Her brother, Harry, is deceased. 
   The elder Mikamis sold the tailor shop and retired to Los Angeles just before World War II. Instead of the surcease they sought in retirement, they were moved to a Japanese internment camp in Arizona--a fate the four children escaped. In honor of their parents, the four Mikami children established the Mikami Scholarship at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and it is available today to any sophomore or junior student. 
   Mary and Irving Rouse were the parents of two boys, Peter M. Rouse of Washington, D.C. and David C. Rouse of Philadelphia. David is a landscape architect and urban designer. In this body, we are most familiar with Pete Rouse, who many of you will recognize as the Chief of Staff to our esteemed Minority Leader TOM DASCHLE. Mary may have been as stern about studies as was her mother because Pete has a B. A. from Colby College, an M.A. from the London School of Economics and an M. A. from Harvard University. In the mid-1970s, Pete and TOM DASCHLE were both legislative assistants to Sen. James Abourezk, D-S.D. While at the Kennedy School at Harvard, Pete became friends with an Alaskan named Terry Miller, who was to become an Alaskan Lt. Governor. In 1979, Miller asked Pete to come to Alaska and work for him in the State House, reestablishing Pete's family ties with the state. 
   The winds of political fortune soon brought him back to Capitol Hill and Chief-of-Staff positions with Representative RICHARD DURBIN, Representative THOMAS DASCHLE and then Senator DASCHLE. But Pete never forgot Alaska and his many friends there. His continuing efforts and interest in our State are greatly appreciated. 
   Mary Mikami's life was an American success story. Hers was an example of achievement against great odds. She honored both of her cultures and her family. She was a combination of Samurai pride, Alaskan fortitude and New England grit. Mary was her own woman before anyone had heard the term ``women's liberation''. She was also a lifelong Democrat, and I'm sure was always very proud of the path her son has followed. Today, I join my colleagues in expressing condolences to the family and friends of Mary Mikami Rouse. Alaska is proud to claim her as one of its pioneers.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, there is a letter in your mailbox from the Internal Revenue Service. Your pulse quickens. Beads of perspiration break out on your brow as you tear open the envelope to see what the most feared agency in Washington has in store for you. 
   At least that's how it used to be. Now the Environmental Protection Agency appears determined to replace the IRS as the government agency you really don't want to hear from. Consider the following true stories from my office case files: 
   A small land owner in Ketchikan recently opened a letter from the EPA to learn that he had been assessed a $40,000 fine for a wetlands violation. He knew he had problems with the EPA, but he had been meeting with EPA officials and had been encouraged that an acceptable mitigation plan might be negotiated. The $40,000 fine hit him like a bolt of lightning our of a clear blue sky. 
   Meanwhile, in Anchorage the commanding general of the United States Army in Alaska received a letter from the EPA. The General knew he had a problem with the powerplant at Fort Wainwright that was not in full compliance with the Clear Air Act, but he and his staff had been working diligently to bring the plant into compliance. With the help of the Alaska Congressional Delegation, he had received a $15.9 million appropriation for new pollution control measures. He had budgeted another $22 million for additional upgrades next year. The Army had, of course, informed EPA of these efforts to bring the plant into compliance, and the EPA seemed satisfied. But the letter the General now held in his hand said that EPA was assessing the U.S. Army with a $16 million fine--a fine greater than the combined value of all EPA fines ever assessed against the U.S. Army nationwide. Another bolt of lightning out of a clear blue sky. 
   These stories suggest that the EPA hasn't learned a fundamental lesson understood by every decent cop--good law enforcement requires discretion. When you're pulled over by a trooper for going a few miles per hour over the speed limit and are calmly discussing the matter with the officer, you have every right to expect that you will not be beaten senseless with a nightstick. And when a small businessman, residential landowner, or U.S. Army general finds himself engaged with the EPA over an alleged violation and is making an effort to find a resolution, he should not be slammed with unprecedented, punitive fines. 
   We need laws to protect the environment, but the interpretation and enforcement of law must be blended with common sense and judgment. Take wetlands protection, for instance. Some wetlands perform critical roles in protecting water supplies and providing important wildlife habitat. Other wetlands are lower value muskeg. The letter of the law may not make the distinction, but human beings with the responsibility of enforcing the law should understand the difference. 
   These ``bolt from the blue'' letters that Alaskans are getting in their mailbox are postmarked Seattle. The EPA regional office ``in charge'' of Alaska is in Seattle. What the EPA folks in Seattle know of Alaska they get from their brief visits, or from their small staff in Anchorage. They aren't our neighbors. They aren't Alaskans. I want to change that. 
   At the risk of enticing the mad dog from an adjacent neighborhood to our own backyard, I am renewing my efforts to force EPA to create a separate region for Alaska. That way, the EPA  officials writing these letters will at least have a chance to better understand the environment in which we live. They would live in our neighborhoods, and send their kids to school with ours. If you're going to get fined, they'll have to look us in the eye. There would be no more scary certified letters from distant bureaucrats in Seattle. 
   In the meantime, I'm inviting the Regional Administrator of the EPA to come and stand with me on Gravina Island, across from Ketchikan, where 13 feet of rain falls each year. As the rain from a driving rainstorm fills his wingtips and rivulets of water cascade down the hill into the Tongass Narrows, I'll ask him to point out where the wetlands end and the uplands begin. I'll also ask him to describe the irreplaceable environmental value of the muskeg that the EPA wants us to keep undisturbed. If I'm not satisfied with his answers I'll advise him to start looking at real estate in Alaska, and suggest he hold a garage sale in preparation for a move out of Seattle. Meanwhile, be afraid. Be very afraid.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, physicians use a specially engineered radioactive molecule as sort of a nuclear Trojan horse in the battle against pancreatic cancer. The molecule is absorbed by the cancer cells and only by the cancer cells. Once inside, the radiation breaks up the DNA and kills the tumor cell--another amazing tool in the war on cancer. 
   The physicians, technicians and even clean-up crews must carefully dispose of the medium that stored the radioactive molecule and other items that may have come in contact with the radioactive materials. There are strict procedures for disposing of such wastes by hospitals, universities, power plants and research facilities. 
   But, in a way, that waste itself is a Trojan horse, sitting innocently in garages or closets in sites all over the country, waiting to be opened up and released on the public by an act of terrorism or of nature like the recent floods the East sustained, or the earthquakes and wildfires more common to the West coast. Most dangerous would be fire which would put the radioactive materials into smoke that could be breathed by anyone near the fire. 
   Why is this a problem? Because there are only three facilities in the entire country that safely can accept such low-level radioactive waste, LLRW: that is material contaminated as a result of medical and scientific research, nuclear power production, biotechnology and other industrial processes. In 1996, about 7,000 cubic meters of LLRW was produced in the nation. 
   A study released by the General Accounting Office at the end of September 1999, holds out little hope for the construction of any new low-level radioactive waste disposal sites as envisioned under the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act, signed by President Jimmy Carter in 1980. That legislation resulted from states lobbying through the National Governors' Association (NGA) to control and regulate LLRW disposal. An NGA task force, that included Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas and was chaired by Governor Bruce Babbitt of Arizona, recommended the states form special compacts to develop shared disposal facilities. 
   The GAO study, which I requested, states, ``By the end of 1998, states, acting alone or in compacts, had collectively spent almost $600 million attempting to develop new disposal facilities. However, none of these efforts have been successful. Only California successfully licensed a facility, but the federal government did not transfer to the state federal land on which the proposed site is located.'' 
   Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt stopped the California facility at Ward Valley from ever becoming reality. National environmental groups and Hollywood activists made Ward Valley a rallying cry, claiming waste would seep through the desert to the water table and into the Colorado River. They claimed to believe this despite two complete environmental impact statements that found no significant environmental impacts associated with a disposal facility at Ward Valley in the Mojave Desert. Secretary Babbitt asked the National Academy of Science to convene an expert panel to determine whether the Colorado River was threatened, and said he would abide by their conclusions. In May 1995, the Academy scientists concluded that the Colorado River was not at risk. Yet, the property was never transferred. 
   But the importance of this issue extends well beyond the borders of the State of California or the borders of its fellow compact members, Arizona, and North and South Dakota, which thought they had a deal with the federal government. The losers are all Americans who believe the President and the executive branch should uphold federal law, not ignore it and obstruct it for the sake of campaign contributions. 
   The GAO states that several reasons are behind the rest of the states giving up on siting new waste disposal facilities. Public and political opposition is cited as the strongest prohibiting factor. Another reason is that, for the time being, states have access to a disposal facility at Barnwell in South Carolina, Richland in Washington State and Envirocare in Utah. A very positive reason cited is the reduction in the volume of low-level waste that is being generated, with waste management and treatment practices including compaction and incineration. 
   However, the report cautions, ``Within 10 years, waste generators in the 41 states that do not have access to the Richland disposal facility may once again be without access to disposal capacity for much of their low-level radioactive wastes.'' Barnwell could decide to close or curtail access as early as 2000, and, at best, will only be open until 2010. The Utah facility disposes of wastes that are only slightly contaminated with radioactivity and thus is not available for all storage. 
   In ten years states will be searching for storage as well as disposal. That storage will be near every university, pharmaceutical company, hospital, research facility or nuclear power plant. It may be down the street from you or within your city limits. And we have the Clinton administration to thank for bringing the materials into our communities like a quiet Trojan horse instead of working with states to establish a secure waste facility. Let's hope nothing ever opens the belly of the beast accidentally.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the Secretary of the Interior today, under the authority of current law, has taken over the management of fisheries in my State of Alaska. Our State legislature has been trying to resolve this problem, along with the Governor and our delegation, for some time. Unfortunately, we were unable to resolve it within the timeframe, so the Feds have officially taken over beginning today. 
   I have directed a letter to the Secretary of Interior putting him on notice that, as chairman of the committee of oversight, chairman of the Energy Committee, I will be conducting a series of oversight hearings on the implementation of his regulations to ensure there is a cooperative effort and involvement of a public process with the State of Alaska, Department of Fish and Game, and the people of Alaska, as he promulgates his regulations, to ensure we are not taken advantage of by an overzealous effort by the Department of Interior to mandate procedures only in the State of Alaska. 
   We are the only State in the Union where the Federal Government has taken over the management of fish and game. Many Alaskans are wondering just what statehood is all about if, indeed, we are not given the authority to manage our fish and game. 
   I will save that for another day. I yield the floor.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, two years ago I rose to highlight a publication of the University of Alaska, Anchorage when it was honored as ``one of the nation's best literary magazines.'' Today, I rise to again call the Senate's attention to the continuing praise for the Alaska Quarterly Review. Specifically, I rise to praise its latest issue, Alaska Native Writers, Storytellers & Orators, The Expanded Edition. 
   The literary journal, now in its 18th year, for its summer-fall issue has published a 400-page volume including more than 80 original works, many by Alaska Natives. The volume could win my praise simply for taking the step of publishing 15 classic Native stories in both English and in traditional Alaska Native languages. You see, in June 1991, I introduced the Alaska Native Languages Preservation Act (S. 1595). The bill, which became law in 1992 and was implemented in 1994, was designed to provide grants to Alaska Native groups and media for language preservation projects, including research, preservation and instruction to teach Alaska's traditional languages to younger Natives. 
   There are 20 original Native languages spoken in Alaska--more than 155 nationwide--but only two of them, Siberian Yup'ik and Central Yup'ik are healthy.'' That means they continue to be spoken by Native children. Thus 18 of the Alaska Native languages face extinction by 2055, unless more is done to preserve them. For example, only a single speaker of Eyak, a language spoken only in the Copper River Delta in Alaska, is still alive to pass the unique sounds of the language on to new speakers. 
   Thus the new effort by the review's Executive Editor and Founding Editor Ronald Spatz of Anchorage would win my praise simply because it has published stories in Eyak, Haida, Tlingit, Tsimshian, Ugangan, Alutiiq, Central Yup'ik, St. Lawrence Island Yup'ik, Inupiaq and Dena'ina. But the issue has done much more for classic and modern literature and for the preservation of Alaska's Native history and traditions. 
   Through its stories, short stories, oral histories, folk tales and poems, the literary magazine has taken a giant step to convey Alaska's rich and diverse Native cultures. It pays tribute to the Native language speakers and tradition bearers that keep their cultures alive through their stories and through their words. And over the years Alaskans have learned that one of the best ways to protect the social fabric of Native Alaskans is to protect their culture, thus maintaining Native residents' pride in their history and their heritage. 
   Kirkus Reviews, in its Aug. 1, 1999 review of the journal called it, ``quite a tidy little omnibus of poems, oral histories, folk tales and stories by Native Alaskans........Sociologists and folklorists will be particularly grateful for the bibliography and source notations, and those unfamiliar with Alaskan culture, will find in the very extensive commentaries a useful orientation to what remains a largely unknown world........offering as they do a glimpse into the history of our Last Frontier.'' 
   This is certainly not the first time that the review has won literary praise. Since its inception at the Anchorage campus of the University of Alaska in 1982, the Alaska Quarterly Review (AQR) has served as an instrument to give voice to Alaska writers and poets, while also publishing the best of material from non-Alaskan authors. While the AQR is firmly rooted in Alaska, it maintains a national perspective--bridging the distance between the literary centers and Alaska, while also sharing an Alaskan perspective. This balanced presentation of views has earned AQR local, regional and national/international recognition over the years. 
   In June 1997 the Washington Post book review section, Book World, called it ``one of the nation's best literary magazines.'' Bill Katz in the Library Journal said ``AQR is highly recommended and deserves applause.'' While Patrick Parks in the Literary Magazine Review said, ``It is an impressive publication, comprising as diverse and rewarding an aggregation of work as a reader is likely to find in any literary journal.'' 
   The review has won a host of national awards including a 1999 Beacon Best award, a 1997 O. Henry Award, a 1996 award from Scribner for Best  American Poetry, and the 1995 Andres Berger Award from Northwest Writers Inc., plus literally a dozen other awards and mentions. 
   I rise today to honor the publication, not just because of its many awards, but because many Alaskans still do not understand or appreciate the breadth and scope of the publication and how important it has become as a gateway for Alaskan authors to win recognition from a wider literary audience. 
   I want to thank the University of Alaska Board of Regents and the leadership of the University of Alaska Anchorage for supporting the publication. Alaska's university system continues to face difficult economic times because of falling Alaska State revenues. It has taken a tremendous commitment to academic excellence to continue the funding necessary to permit the review to be a quality publication and artistic success. The University deserves great credit for its efforts at promoting the publication in these difficult financial times. It is because of the need for more revenues for the University to permit it to reach the highest level of greatness that I continue to press for the University to finally gain its full land-grant entitlement that it should have received at its founding. The University of Alaska Land Grant Bill, still pending full Senate consideration, would greatly help the University gain the economic means to support such important endeavors. But more on that at another time. 
   I also want to thank and again publicly recognize the work of Mr. Spatz. A recent recipient of the 1999 Edith R. Bullock Award for Excellence--the most prestigious award bestowed by the University of Alaska Foundation, Mr. Spatz is a professor and chair of the University of Alaska Anchorage's Department of Creative Writing and Literary Arts and has been involved with the UAA's honors program. A film maker and writer, besides editor, Mr. Spatz wrote a series of illuminating notes in the current volume. He was joined in shaping it by Contributing Editors Jeane Breinig, assistant professor of English at the University of Alaska Anchorage, and by Patricia Partnow, vice president of Education at the Alaska Native Heritage Center. A final thank you must be provided to the National Endowment for the Arts, which provided a Heritage and Preservation Grant that helped pay the costs of publication of the expanded edition. 
   Mr. President, Alaska, in fact all of America, is far richer artistically because of the review's presence. It truly is a window for Americans to view society in Alaska at the close of the 20th Century, and a worthy stage for the serious works of all writers as we enter the 21th Century. That is particularly the case with this edition. I commend it and its contributors for its many achievements, and I know all members of the U.S. Senate join me in wishing it continued success.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I have listened to the debate with a little frustration, as I am sure my colleagues have, regarding the emotional arguments prevailing on an issue that fails to give disclosure to the public on what this issue is all about. 
   The Hutchison moratorium amendment keeps the MMS from spending money for 1 year to implement a new rule that amounts to another tax, a value-added tax, on oil produced in the United States on Federal leases. What they don't say in the debate is who pays this additional tax. It is the American consumer, the taxpayer, the public. 
   Bureaucrats don't have the right to unilaterally establish a tax. That is just what this proposal does. That is a right that is reserved in the Constitution, by the Constitution to this Congress. Existing law says royalties should be collected at the lease, not after value has been added downstream as the rule proposed by Department of Interior would do. This MMS rule, for the first time in history, embraces a value-added tax concept to oil valuation. 
   There is little mention about the energy security interests of this country. We are now dependent upon imported oil. Imported oil is the No. 1 contributor to our trade deficit. The domestic oil industry is in tough shape. In 1973, during the oil embargo, we imported 36 percent of our oil. Today, we import 56 percent. The Department of Energy says that figure will go up to the 63- to 64-percent area by the years 2005, 2006, and 2007, and over 55,000 American jobs have been lost in the last 2 years in the oil industry, five times the number in the steel industry. The MMS rule drives U.S. jobs overseas, increases our trade deficit, and makes America more dependent on one area of the world that is very volatile, the Mideast. 
   This moratorium by the Senator from Texas has been in place for 2 years. The press has reported two Government employees have been paid $350,000 each from a group associated with the trial lawyers as an award for pushing for the new rule which benefits--benefits whom? It doesn't benefit the taxpayer or the consumer; it benefits the lawyers. The Department of the Interior inspector general and Justice Department are investigating. Something is rotten around here. It is not in Denmark. It has something to do with the process. 
   This has the effect of turning our Government regulation over to the highest bidder. No rule tainted by payoffs to the rulemakers should be tolerated. It is interesting to note, as the Senator from Texas has, they say they want to simplify a process. The chart today reminds me of the chart Senator SPECTER presented to this body describing the simplified health care that had been proposed by the First Lady and the administration. Again, look at this chart. If that is a simplified chart on the workable manner in which MMS proposes a 
   value-added method for determining the appropriate royalty for oil, you and I both know that won't hold water. 
   This is a cancer within Government. We talk about whistleblowers and those who are supporting the proposed MMS gasoline and heating oil tax which Senator HUTCHISON's amendment postpones for 1 year. When they think about a whistleblower, most people think of something someone sees is wrong, who blows a whistle to draw attention. The Federal Government has laws on the books to protect whistleblowers who come forward to report fraud and abuse. 
   Let's look at this case. This case is a little different. Two Federal employees, one working for the Department of the Interior and the other working for the Department of Energy--the two Departments of jurisdiction; these are supposed to be objective people--worked behind the scenes and pushed for the MMS rule change. They were paid $350,000 each on September 13, 1999 as rewards for their work. There is a copy of the check. 
   The point of this is, they were paid by a self-described public interest group which has about 200 members. This group, the Project On Government Oversight, or POGO, has rather curious ties to law firms which have made millions of dollars from suing oil companies over oil royalties. Make no mistake about who pays: The public. 
   As an example, POGO's board of directors has included lawyers who have worked directly on these cases for years. The City of Long Beach, CA, lost the most recent case. An attorney for the city said they spent about $100 million on the case. That is $100 million that could have been spent on education and was spent on lawyers instead. 
   The Department of the Interior is investigating, but it is illegal for Federal employees to be paid for pursuing changes to Federal regulations by those who benefit from such changes. Our Secretary of the Interior, what has he done? He has done nothing. The Interior Department had nothing to do with it. 
   The Hutchison amendment should be adopted to give time to work on a fair and simple regulation to States, Federal lessees, and taxpayers. 
   That chart is not a simplification. I commend my colleague for her effort to expose the truth behind the fiction we have heard so much about today. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to take this time to pay tribute to the men of Air Force Rescue 470, from the 210th Rescue Squadron in the Alaska Air National Guard. These five men, stationed at Kulis Air National Guard Base in Anchorage, Alaska, recently received the Mackay Trophy. The Mackay Trophy is given each year to the person or crew in the United States Air Force for what is considered the most meritorious flight of the year. The crew of Air Force Rescue 470 certainly deserve this prestigious award. 
   Let me tell you a little bit about the rescue they performed which led to this recognition. On May 27, 1998, six people, including two small children, flying in the Tordrillo Mountains, suddenly crashed into a glacier about 10,500 feet above sea level. These people were trapped in their plane, with darkness coming and the temperature dropping. Because they were not dressed for the extreme cold that would come, these six people would surely not survive the night. 
   Fortunately for them, they had some of the best trained, best equipped, and bravest men were on the way to the crash site. This was not an easy rescue by any means. It was already extremely cold, visibility was only 1/8 of a mile, the wind was anywhere between ten and forty knots, and the crashed plane was high up the mountain. Normally any one of these factors would make a rescue attempt extremely risky. But Air Force Rescue 470 had to contend with all sorts of deterrents in order to rescue these people before nightfall came. 
   The crew had to fly up to an altitude of over 12,000 feet because of the visibility problem. The thin air made it difficult for the helicopter blades to keep the aircraft aloft and for the men to breathe. As soon as a hole in the clouds appeared, they dove down into the mountainous terrain to land. The weather was only getting worse, and the pararescuers had only fifty minutes, because of the limited fuel supply, to pry open the wreckage of the downed plane, get everyone out, and get them all safely back to the helicopter, six hundred feet away. All six lives were saved. 
   Mr. President, I know that the crew of Air Force Rescue 470 were simply happy to be serving their country on this day back in May of 1998. I also know that they have made countless other rescues, just as have other Rescue units around the country. But I am especially proud that these fine young men of the Alaska Air National Guard were chosen for the Mackay Trophy. So to Lieutenant Colonel John Jacobs, the pilot, First Lieutenant Thaddeus Stolar, the copilot, Master Sergeant Scott Hamilton, Master Sergeant Steve Daigle, and Technical Sergeant Greg Hopkins, the pararescuers, I congratulate you. Both Alaska and the nation thank you for your continued efforts to save lives.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report on the Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2000. The conference report includes provisions to address the chronic security problems at the Department of Energy nuclear weapons laboratories. 
   We need to make major organizational changes to the Department of Energy in order to protect the national security--to keep our nuclear secrets from falling into the wrong hands. There is no question that the U.S. has suffered a major loss of our nuclear secrets. According to the House Select Committee's report, the Chinese have succeeded in stealing critical information on all of our most advanced nuclear weapons. I repeat: The House report shows that we lost critical information on all of our advanced nuclear weapons! That is unacceptable! 
   The extensive Senate hearing record--in both open and closed meetings held by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Governmental Affairs Committee--makes clear that we lost these secrets due to poor management by the top levels of the Department of Energy--which led to lax security and a lack of accountability and responsibility. 
   Let me quote from the report of the President's foreign intelligence advisory board--the Rudman report--titled ``Science at its best: Security at its worst.''  
   Organizational disarray, managerial neglect, and a culture of arrogance--both at DOE headquarters and the labs themselves--conspired to create an espionage scandal waiting to happen. 
   The Department of Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy that has proven it is incapable of reforming itself. 
   Accountability at DOE has been spread so thinly and erratically that it is now almost impossible to find. 
   Never have the members of the Special Investigative Panel witnessed a bureaucratic culture so thoroughly saturated with cynicism and disregard for authority. 
   Never before has this panel found such a cavalier attitude toward one of the most serious responsibilities in the federal government--control of the design information relating to nuclear weapons. 
   Never before has the panel found an agency with the bureaucratic insolence to dispute, delay, and resist implementation of a Presidential directive on security.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Despite this damming criticism by the President's own foreign intelligence advisory board to date not a single high level bureaucrat at DOE--or the FBI or the Justice Department, for that matter--has been removed, demoted or disciplined over this massive failure. Only a very few low-level DOE employees have suffered--including the person who first blew the whistle. 
   The problem is clear. The question is: Do we want this to continue, or are we going to fix the problem? 
   One thing we can not discuss in open session, is the extent of this problem. We can say that this problem is much more extensive than has been reported. We can also say that it is a continuing problem. And we can say that it is not just espionage by China, it is also espionage by other countries that we must stop. 
   The Administration is against fixing the problem; DOE Secretary Richardson is opposed to the provisions Conference Report. When this was last debated in the Senate, Secretary Richardson sent two letters threatening veto by the President--and he continues to voice his opposition to this legislation. However, the President's own independent and nonpartisan Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board agrees with our legislative solution--creating a semi-autonomous agency within DOE is the way to fix the problem. 
   Again, let me quote from the Rudman report:  
   The panel is convinced that real and lasting security and counterintelligence reform at the weapons labs is simply unworkable within DOE's current structure and culture. 
   To achieve the kind of protection that these sensitive labs must have, they and their functions must have their own autonomous operational structure free of all the other obligations imposed by DOE management.  
   Under the current DOE organization structure everyone is in charge, but no one is responsible--no one is accountable. This legislation changes that. This legislation establishes accountability and responsibility at the Department of Energy. It does so by establishing a new semi-autonomous ``National Nuclear Security Administration'' inside the Department of Energy. 
   The Nuclear Security Administration will be a self-contained organization that will be fully in charge of all aspects of our nuclear weapons program--and fully accountable. 
   This new agency will be headed up by a new Under Secretary of Energy. The new Under Secretary will be responsible for all aspects of our nuclear weapons program, including the DOE weapons labs. If there is a problem in the future we will know who to point the finger at--a single agency with a single person heading it in charge of all aspects of the nuclear weapons program. 
   As further evidence for the need for this legislation, I would like to quote the testimony of Mr. Vic Reis, the former Assistant Secretary of Energy for Defense Programs, just before he was forced out by Secretary Richardson for disagreeing with the Secretary's position on the need to create a semi-autonomous agency. Mr. Reis said:  
   You may recall at a previous hearing, Mr. Chairman, you noticed me in the audience and you asked for my opinion as to who, or what was to blame for the security issues at the national laboratories. I responded that I didn't think you would find any one individual to blame, but that the organizational structure of the DOE was so flawed that security lapses are almost inevitable. 
   The root cause of the difficulties at DOE is simply that DOE has too many disparate missions to be managed effectively as a coherent organization. The price of gasoline, refrigerator standards, Quarks, nuclear cleanup and nuclear weapons just don't come together naturally. 
   Because of all this multilayered cross-cutting, there is no one accountable for the operation of any part of the organization except the Secretary, and no Secretary has the time to lead the whole thing effectively. By setting up a semi-autonomous agency, many of these problems go away.  
   The way to stop espionage at the DOE laboratories then is to vote for the conference report. 
   Before I yield the floor I want to mention one element of DOE's defense programs that we do not reorganize, although it is made part of the new National Nuclear Security Administration. That is the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program. 
   The Conference report language was very carefully and specifically crafted  to ensure that the organization, responsibilities and authorities of the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program are not diminished or otherwise compromised. The Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program, referred to as ``Naval Reactors'' in the Department of Energy, has long been a model of excellence, efficiency and integrity. Naval Reactors has provided safe, reliable, long-lived and militarily-effective nuclear propulsion plants for our Nation since U.S.S. Nautilus went to sea in 1955. These nuclear propulsion plants are found in our largest ships, the Nimitz class nuclear aircraft carriers with over 5,500 personnel on board. They are also found in one of our smallest ships, the NR-1 deep-submergence research and ocean engineering vehicle with a crew of only five to ten. These nuclear propulsion plants also are crucial to the ability of our Nation's exceptional ballistic missile and attack submarine fleets to perform their national security missions. 
   Under the conference report, Naval Reactors will continue to maintain clear, total responsibility and accountability for all aspects of Naval nuclear propulsion, including design, construction, operation, operator training, maintenance, refueling, and ultimate disposal, plus associated radiological control, safety, environmental and health matters, and program administration. The Program's structure will continue to include roles within both the Navy and the DOE, with direct access to the Secretaries of Navy and Energy. The success of the Program is due in part to its simple, enduring, and focused structure set forth in Public Law 98-525, which is not changed by the Conference Report. 
   Also of great importance are the Program's clear and simplified lines of authority, and the culture of excellence in technical work, as well as managerial, fiscal, and security matters. These too are unaffected by the Conference Report. 
   With fifty-one years of unparalleled success, Naval Reactors has amassed a record that reflects the wisdom of its structure, policies, and practices. Naval nuclear propulsion plants have safely steamed over 117 million miles--over 5,000 reactor-years of safe operations. Moreover, there has never been a naval reactor accident, or any release of radioactivity that has had a significant effect on the public or environment. 
   For these reasons, the Conference Report makes it clear that this exceptional national asset will in no way be hindered from maintaining its record of excellence. The language creating the new National Nuclear Security Administration in the Department of Energy in no way changes the management or operations of Naval Reactors. I am confident Naval Reactors will remain a technical organization unequaled in accomplishment throughout the world, and a crown jewel in our Nation's security.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I commend my good friend and colleague, Senator VOINOVICH from Ohio, who I think has brought to the attention of this body in a timely manner a very appropriate and important issue; that is, the realization that the President is going to reject any proposal for a tax cut--and bring to the attention of this body the realization that, indeed, that accumulated debt of $5.6 trillion, which the Senator from Ohio referred to, is costing us interest. 
   As the Senator from Ohio is well aware, I was in the banking business for about 25 years. People do not recognize the carrying charge. I think the figure that was used was $600 million per day. 
   Interest is like the old saying of having a horse that eats while you sleep. It is ongoing. It doesn't take Saturdays or Sundays off. 
   If one considers the significance of, I think the figure was 14 cents out of every dollar going for interest, one can quickly comprehend what we could do if we were free of that heavy obligation. 
   I commend the Senator for bringing this matter to the attention of this body and assure him of my eagerness to work with him to bring about and resolve in a responsible manner a program to address the accumulated debt. 
   As he has pointed out, there is an awful lot of procedure around here relative to the bookkeeping method of the Federal Government, which few people understand. 
   Nevertheless, there is a harsh reality that we have a hard debt of $5.6 billion. We have an opportunity now with the Social Security surplus to address that debt. I agree with the Senator and his efforts to try to bring a consensus on this issue. I commend him highly. Let me assure the Senator of my willingness to work in that regard.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this morning I had an opportunity to meet with the Governor of Puerto Rico, the Honorable Pedro Rosello. The purpose was to discuss a variety of issues affecting our relationship with Puerto Rico. The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, which I chair, has the responsibility for the territories and the freely associated States of the United States, of which Puerto Rico is one. That responsibility derives from the plenary authority of the Federal Government over the territories, which is placed in the Congress under article IV of the Constitution. 
   I take that responsibility very seriously. My State was a territory until 1959. I truly remember the days when my State was totally dependent on the goodwill of the Congress. Sometimes that goodwill was somewhat lacking. We were American citizens. We did not enjoy the right to vote. We had no representation in Congress. We were subject to Federal income tax. Some Alaskans thought they would feel good about filing under protest and would write that across their income tax return, but that is about the extent of the satisfaction they got. In any event, I do have a certain sensitivity for the American people of Puerto Rico. 
   I think it is fair to remind my colleagues that Congress is vested with the power to admit States and the power to dispose of the territory status of those areas within the United States. This is one of the fundamental authorities that affect the nature of our society and the nature of our Government. Thirty-seven times we have acted to admit new States to the Union. Once we acted to grant independence. In the interim, we have governed areas that expanded this Nation from Thirteen Original Colonies to a country that stretches from the Virgin Islands to Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and from Maine to Alaska to American Samoa in the South Pacific. We have tried, perhaps not always successfully, to be responsive to the needs and aspirations of the residents of the territories. 
   Coming from a former territory, I understand the unhappiness of living in territorial status subject to decisions made in Washington. As a consequence, I try to be fair and sensitive and sympathetic to the aspirations and concerns of the people of Puerto Rico, the American people of Puerto Rico, and whether a continuing quest for self-determination, which I happen to believe is appropriate and an obligation of this Congress, is something that is still unresolved with regard to the Americans and the people of Puerto Rico. 
   Perhaps a little history might be helpful on this. Referring to my own State, we were purchased for $7.2 million in 1867 from Russia with citizenship except for the ``uncivilized native tribes.'' Full citizenship to all residents was not enacted until 1915. Alaska was then subject to military government for 17 years. When we requested an extension of the homestead laws in order to settle a territory, our requests were then ignored by Washington. The Organic Act of 1884 provided for civil government and an appointed Governor but did not provide for either a legislative assembly or a delegate to Congress. However, in 1906, 39 years after acquisition, we were finally granted a nonvoting delegate to Congress in the House of Representatives. In 1912, an Organic Act provided for a local legislature with limited authority subject to veto by an appointed Governor to the State of Alaska, appointed by the President with the oversight of Congress. 
   In some respects Puerto Rico obtained greater local self-government faster than we did in Alaska. In 1950, Puerto Rico had an elective Governor and Constitution while Alaska was still subject to appointed officials. While we now have an elected Governor and Statehood, we are still subject to appointed officials, some of whom appear to think that Statehood and federalism are arcane and outdated concepts--impediments to the achievement of their particular concept of public good. 
   Mr. President, if that level of insensitivity to the needs and aspirations of local residents and the wishes of elected officials occurs in a State, you can imagine how the residents of a territory feel. That brings me to the subject of this legislation I introduced today. 
   Vieques is a 33,000 acre island off the east coast of Puerto Rico, approximately 22 miles long by 6 miles wide. The federal government acquired 2/3 of the island in 1941. The population of 9,400 resides in the west central area of the island, sandwiched between two military areas. The western portion of the island is used as a Navy Supply Depot with 102 magazines. The eastern portion contains a maneuvering area for amphibious/land training and a Live Impact Area that is part of the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility. 
   Vieques is the only target range in the U.S. where aircrews drop live ordnance from tactical altitudes, above 18,000 feet. The facility also supports shore bombardment training with live ordnance. Although the civilian population resides about 8 miles from the Live Impact Area, relations have been tense for some time, as you might expect if your community was the recipient of regularly scheduled live exercises with live ammunition. You would keep one eye open at night. 
   It finally happened on April 19, 1999. An F/A-18 from the JFK Battlegroup participating in live fire training as part of deployment preparations dropped two 500 pound bombs near an observation post within the Live Fire Impact area. A civilian contract security guard was unfortunately killed and four other personnel received minor injuries. While this is the only fatality to have occurred over the past sixty years, there have been several minor incidents within the Live Fire Impact area. The guard, David Sanes Rodriguez, was 35 and one of 17 siblings who grew up in the La Mina sector of Vieques. 
   Mr. President, you have heard me complain any number of times about the abuse that my constituents must endure from disinterred federal bureaucracy. We are denied the ability to develop our resources. We cannot obtain rights-of-way to connect our towns and villages. We cannot connect by road, by rail, or by wire. I will not go through how many of my constituents have died because we cannot obtain a simple right-of-way through a few miles of a wildlife refuge so they can obtain emergency medical treatment. This is the case in my State. At least the federal government is not dropping live ordnance on my constituents. 
   I fully understand the reasons why the Governor and virtually everyone in Puerto Rico has called for an end to the use of Vieques as a target range. I  also understand that this would not happen if Puerto Rico were not a territory. I fully support the need for our armed services to train, deploy, and test weapons. But there are certain things you simply don't do in an inhabited area. I deeply regret that it took an accident to highlight this situation, but that is the case. 
   For that reason, legislation I have introduced will amend the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act to transfer control over Vieques to the government of Puerto Rico for public purposes. The term ``public purpose'' is very broad and will include the same public benefit uses that we authorized for lands transferred to Guam several years ago. 
   Finally, the day may come when Congress no longer exercises plenary authority over Puerto Rico but the Puerto Rican people will have determined their self-determination. Until that time, all of us have a responsibility to respond to the needs of our fellow citizens who reside there and in the other territories, as well as our own constituents. I hope my colleagues would join me in this amendment. 
   I see no other Senators seeking recognition, so I yield the floor.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment with Senator LAUTENBERG and 25 other Senators to provide $20 million for the stateside Land and Water Conservation Fund or LWCF matching grant program. 
   Too often we forget that--in addition to a National Park System--we have national system of parks which includes tens of thousands of State and local parks. More than 37,000 of these State and local parks and recreation facilities have received a stateside LWCF matching grant, but there is a problem. The stateside LWCF program has been shut down because Congress hasn't funded it. Yet O.C.S. revenues currently are at $4 billion. 
   Over 30 years ago, in a bipartisan effort, Congress created the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The LWCF is funded with Federal revenues from off-shore oil and gas leasing which now exceed $4 billion a year. LWCF money can be used for two purposes:

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations knows, the Environmental Protection Agency and the country have been constantly seeking cleaner-burning diesel fuel. In fact, the administration has already announced new, stricter emissions standards for heavy vehicles as an incentive to move to other technologies. Would the Senator agree that the answer to this issue lies partly in the engine design, but more importantly in the type of fuel we burn?

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Natural gas is nearly everywhere in the United States and does not need to be imported. We have somewhere between 30 to 60 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in Alaska, which could replace a significant amount of the diesel fuel market, if the GTL process can be proved to be viable. 
   I have been interested in securing funding a private-public partnership to study GTL's performance as fuel. The study will report on the following: (1) How important fuel characteristics affect the performance and emissions of different diesel engines; (2) Experimental performance of diesel engines burning fuels like GTL fuels; (3) Engine design modifications which enhance performance using such fuels; and (4) Chemistry of GTL production. I would ask if the subcommittee chairman is aware of the premise that GTL technology has in producing a cleaner burning fuel?

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my good friend. Being a member of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources the subcommittee chairman is well aware of Glacier Bay National Park. He is aware of it this year for some of the controversy that has been caused by the Park Service's attempts to prohibit commercial and subsistence fishing within the bounds of the park. 
   However, there is an area that the local community, the Park Service, and the Alaska Congressional Delegation do want to work together on in the park--a new visitor facility. Glacier Bay National Park is one of Alaska's treasures. More than 350,000 visitors come to the park each year. Currently, there is no single place for them  to go to learn about the park resources, native inhabitants, and spectacular beauty. The local native corporation has proposed a shared cost effort with the Park Service to build such a facility. Is the subcommittee chairman aware of this?

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. 
   Madam President, let's start with some facts because what is appropriate is to recognize just what the current policy of the administration is towards the U.S. forests managed by the Forest Service. 
   Clearly, as we look at where we are today, as this chart shows in the dark purple, the U.S. Forest Service volume sold, vis-a-vis the annual mortality--the annual mortality are those trees that are dead or dying--that in the years 1990, 1992, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, the annual mortality, compared with the volume sold--and that is evident by the green spheres that come up through the chart--the mortality has exceeded the commercial volume sold. 
   The suggestion is, what has happened to forest health? 
   You have to manage for forest health based on professionals, professionals who are trained and have committed their lives to best forest management practices. 
   What we have in the debate that is occurring on this floor is a debate over emotions, the emotions over whether timber, trees, a renewable resource, should be harvested or not. 
   We have heard the Senator from Idaho expound a little bit on the attitude prevailing in the U.S. environmental groups, and particularly the Sierra Club, which, much to their credit, has come out wholeheartedly and said: We want to terminate harvesting in the national forests, all of the national forests. 
   They make no bones about it. That is just a fact. 
   The justification for Senator BRYAN's amendment, which would timber program in the committee bill by $34 million, leads to the environmental agenda, the agenda of the Sierra Club that wants to terminate harvesting in national forests. 
   The amendment isn't what it appears to be. While I am sympathetic to my friend from Oregon and his efforts to redirect $10 million to wildlife surveys in the Northwest, I again think we ought to go back and recognize where the objection is. The objection comes from national environmental groups who are opposed to logging in the national forests. The policies of the Clinton administration relative to logging in the national forests are evident, but the justification to support that is very lacking if we look at the facts. 
   The facts are that there is currently almost 250 billion cubic feet--more than 1 trillion board feet--of volume of standing timber in the national forests. That is a significant amount--250 billion cubic feet of volume. The annual growth--that is the growth that occurs every year--is about 23 billion board feet. 
   Do you know what we are cutting, Madam President? We are cutting somewhere between 2.5 and 3 billion board feet. What is the justification in the sense of forest management practices and the forest health when clearly the forests are not in danger of being overcut? The regrowth at 23 billion board feet each year, compared with the cut of 2.5 to 3 billion board feet, clearly shows we are growing timber faster, much faster than we are cutting it--in fact, about 7 to 8 times faster than we are cutting it. As evidenced by this chart, the mortality now is exceeding what we are cutting in commercial timber. 
   Good forest management practices would indicate something be done about the dead and dying trees that are infested with the spruce bark beetle and so forth, and that a program be initiated so healthy trees grow back in again. But, again, these decisions are not being made by those responsible for forest health, professional forest managers. They are being made by environmental groups, and they are being made on the basis of emotional arguments. 
   You should recognize the reality that timber is a renewable resource that can be properly managed, as evidenced by the existing volume that we have in this country, 250 billion cubic feet in the national forests--and I will repeat it again--with 23 billion board feet annual growth, and the realization we are only cutting 3 billion board feet a year. 
   We certainly need some changes. The changes need to move off the emotional arguments and get into what is good for the forests, what is good for the health of the forests. You clear out the diseased trees. You encourage programs that eliminate fire 
   hazards. 
   I have worked with Senator BRYAN and his colleague from Nevada on mining legislation which is important to his State and important to Western States, important to my State of Alaska. I am disappointed that he has seen fit to again take this issue on to reduce by $34 million the Committee's recommended timber program. I recognize that is not a big issue in his State. But I think it basically addresses a policy within this administration that has prevailed for some time, and that is to oppose resource development on public lands, whether it be grazing, whether it be oil and gas leasing, whether it be mining, and certainly in the case of timber. 
   I would like to communicate a little experience that we had in Alaska relative to studies and the resource management associated with the wildlife of the forest and to suggest to the Senator from Oregon that these challenges on the adequacy of wildlife studies seem endless. You no sooner get a professional opinion on the adequacy or inadequacy of a certain species within the forest, and if it is unfavorable to those who want to terminate logging in the forest, they simply go to a judge, get an injunction, and suggest that the study was inadequate and lacked the thoroughness that it needed. 
   Let me tell you a little story about what happened in Alaska. 
   We had the U.S. Forest Service involved in what they called the TLMP, the Tongass Land Management Plan. They spent 10 years to develop a plan. They spent $13 million. Previously, we had been cutting about 420 million board feet a year. The TLMP came down, after this 10-year study and $13 million, and cut it, the allowable cut, to 267 million board feet. 
   What happened as a consequence of that? We lost our only two year-round manufacturing plants in our State. The Sitka and Ketchikan pulpmills, the combined workforce, plus those in the woods, amounted to some 3,400 jobs, most of which were lost. 
   What was the forest health issue regarding this reduction? All the timber in the Tongass, as most Members who have been up there know, is old growth timber. But what they do not realize is that 30 percent of that timber is dead or dying. It has no other use than wood fiber. So it is put in the pulp mills. 
   Without the pulp mills, we have no utilization of that timber. Much of those logs are now ground up in chips or exported to Japan or out to pulp mills in the Pacific Northwest. 
   Let me go back to the Tongass Land Management Plan where they cut the sales level from 420 million board feet to 267 million board feet. Within 9 months, the administration, after spending 10 years and $13 million, decided that volume of 267 million board  feet was too high. So they cut it arbitrarily, without any public hearing, as a consequence of pressure from national environmental groups who used an emotional argument, and also the reality that maybe the easiest place to terminate harvesting in national forests is in Alaska. We have two Senators and one Congressman. Alaska is a long way away. Nobody can go up and look at it and recognize that we have cut less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the Tongass forest in Alaska over the last 40 years and that our regrowth is 10 times what we have cut. 
   They want to terminate harvesting, and the Tongass national forest in Alaska is a good place to start. So they came back and cut the proposed allowable sales level from 267 to 178 million--no public hearings, no input, no further studies. They spent, again, 10 years and $13 million for the first study, and they weren't satisfied with it. 
   So I say to my friend from Oregon, don't be misled by the question of the adequacy of wildlife studies in the Pacific Northwest. On the goshawk, we in Alaska are now under a challenge, on an issue we thought we had behind us because several years ago we had a challenge on a threatened and endangered species, the goshawk. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spent several years working with the Forest Service to do an evaluation, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service came to the conclusion that the goshawk was not threatened by the timber harvest program in the Tongass. We thought we had that issue behind us. We didn't. 
   Environmental groups--from the Southwest, I might add--petitioned the judge on the adequacy of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service evaluation of the goshawk study and the judge said, go back and do it again. If you can't depend on the best experts to come to a conclusion, then this is simply an open-ended effort by either bureaucrats, or environmental groups, or both to terminate harvesting in the national forests. That is what has happened as a consequence of the attitude of this administration towards timber harvesting. 
   Again, we have 250 billion cubic feet of volume standing in the national forests of the United States. The annual growth is 23 billion board feet. We are harvesting between 2.5 and 3 billion board feet. We are regrowing seven to eight times our annual harvest. Yet we have those who would say the forest program is being subsidized. There is no realization of what timber sales and related roads offer in providing access for timber, availability to the public, jobs, payrolls and communities. The proposal by Senator BRYAN would reduce the program about 13 percent below the current 1999 program level.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I urge the Congress to support the significant contribution that the timber program, even though it is in decline, has been making to improve the national forests. 
   Again, recognize that the program is smaller than a few years ago. The BRYAN amendment would continue this harmful slide, because the ultimate objective is to terminate harvesting in the national forests. The redirecting of timber funds to wildlife activities in support of timber still has the same negative effect. That negative effect has been highlighted by my friend from Idaho, as he discussed the effects of a reduction in the timber program. 
   What we are talking about on this chart is that there is more timber dying than is being cut. That is the harsh reality of where we are. What kind of forest management practice is that? It is a preservationist practice. 
   What is the role of the Forest Service? Habitat management? Stewards of the forest? They are not aggressive in thinning programs, which are needed for the growth of new trees. What the Forest Service has become is a custodial management agency. They don't know where they are going. They are torn between past leaders that used to make decisions on the basis of what is best for forest health, and the new generation that is directed to a large degree by national environmental groups that want to terminate harvesting in the national forests. 
   It is OK if you are from a State that has large private holdings. Washington State has a number of large private land companies. It is OK if you have large State-owned forests. But if you are in my State of Alaska, where the Federal Government, the U.S. Forest Service--the entire Tongass National Forest is owned and managed by the Federal Government--you have a different set of circumstances. Our communities are in the forest. Our State capital, Juneau, towns like Ketchikan, Wrangell, Petersburg, Haines, Skagway, Sitka, all are in the forest. People live in the forest. They were under the assumption they would be able to work with the Federal Government, when we became a State in 1959, to maintain, on a renewable basis, an industry base. They recognize that in our case our forest, as an old-growth forest, is in the process of dying. Thirty percent of that timber is dying. 
   I had an opportunity to fly over some of the Northeastern States over the recess, Maine and other areas. I noted that they have a healthy timber industry, managed, if you will, to a large degree through the private holdings of landowners and corporations and the State. They have jobs. They have pulp mills. They have a renewability. Yet we are strangled by policies that are dictated by environmental groups, that are dictated by Members from States who have no interest in the national forest from the standpoint of those of us who are dependent on it in the West and particularly in my State in Alaska. 
   Finally, I ask that my colleagues reflect that this amendment would really reduce the tools the Forest Service has available for stewardship activities, tools that improve forest health and improve wildlife habitat and improve other forest ecosystems as well. Don't be misled by the objective of those who have a different agenda with regard to the national forests. Let us recognize that forests live and die. With proper management, they can yield a bounty of prosperity, a bounty of renewability. But we have to have the recognition that those decisions with regard to the forest are not going to be made by the politicians in this body. They are going to be made by those professionals who are prepared to put their reputation behind their recommendations or, for that matter, the other way around, and do what is best for the forest. The Bryan amendment certainly does not do this, by cutting funding for timber sales and roads, and hence, decreasing the timber program.  
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator HUTCHISON's amendment to keep the Department of Interior from spending additional money for one year to implement their flawed oil valuation regulation. I am a cosponsor of the amendment. 
   Our amendment does two things: First, it puts the Senate on record opposing a Value-added Tax proposed by the executive branch. Second, it prevents MMS from implementing a rule that is so corrupt the Interior Department's inspector general and the Department of Justice are currently investigating $700,000 in payoffs to federal employees involved in the rule. 
   The CBO scored the impact of this amendment at $11 million. This is the apparent cost of standing up for Congress' constitutional prerogative to raise revenues. 
   The domestic oil and gas industry is being driven from our shores. During the oil embargo in 1973, we imported 36 percent of our oil. Today, we import 56 percent of our oil. We will continue to burn oil--in fact, we burn a bit more now than we did in 1973. But our own industry is in a death spiral, caused in part by government actions like this. Over 50,000 American families have lost their jobs in the last two years as companies leave the U.S. for foreign shores--foreign shores where it's cheaper to drill and governments encourage domestic energy production. 
   Without adoption of the Hutchison amendment, we will be saying: ``Go ahead. Raise royalties and taxes. We, the U.S. Senate, yield our power to the Executive.'' This Senator cannot stand by and watch all power flow to the Executive. 
   ``RENT-A-RULE''--POGO, ETC.
   Neither can this Senator stand aside when there are serious allegations of payoffs to government employees involved in the rule. 
   In May of this year, the press began to report that two federal employees--one at the Department of Interior; the other, retired from the Department of energy--had taken $700,000 from a self-described ``public interest group'' as an ``award'' for their work in the federal government on the rule to raise royalty rates on domestic oil producers. This group, the project on Government Oversight, or POGO, has not been very effective in its membership drive--it has only about 200 subscribers--but it has been very successful attracting trial lawyers as board members. In fact, the trial lawyers on its board have spent years litigating the very cases on oil value that the proposed DOI rule would benefit if the Boxer Amendment is adopted. 
   The inspector general and the U.S. Department of Justice public Integrity Section are investigating these payments. 
   In two letters to the Secretary of Interior, Senators DOMENICI, NICKLES, and I have asked the Department to withdraw the proposed rule pending the outcome of the investigations into  whether the employees can take money for ``fixing'' a rule. The Department has declined to do so twice. 
   In answering our first letter, DOI said the two had nothing to do with the rule. Senators DOMENICI, NICKLES, and I wrote back, this time providing public documents proving their involvement, and asking them, based upon the evidence, to withdraw the rule. 
   The response to our second letter was to acknowledge that the two apparently did have some involvement in the rule, but the decision to change the rule was made prior to their official involvement. 
   The Department's argument is misleading. The two federal employees worked hand-in-glove with POGO to convince the Department to craft a rule to POGO's liking. According to POGO's Executive Director, POGO even arranged for the employees to be specifically requested to testify before a House subcommittee to put pressure on the Department to start a rulemaking. 
   All the facts suggest that these employees were influential, if not instrumental, in the decision to issue the rule and the content of the rule. After influencing the decision to issue the rule, the employees took part in the public comment phase of the rulemaking. In other words, they were up to their elbows in this issue from start to finish. 
   A skeptic could conclude that the employees, working with POGO and the trial attorneys who stood to gain from out-of-court settlements, earned their ``rewards.'' POGO, after all, admits they paid them $350,000 each. The Department's position appears to be that POGO paid the wrong bureaucrats. 
   The public integrity of the public rulemaking process is at stake, even if Secretary Babbitt fails to see it. 
   In our nation, federal employees are not paid to push rule changes which benefit one party in a lawsuit. This is a dangerous precedent.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong favor of the Conference agreement that will provide every single American a well deserved refund of the taxes they are now overpaying as the government runs a surplus. 
   I especially want to commend Chairman ROTH for the extraordinary work  he did in what must be record time to produce this Conference report. My colleagues should recollect that barely 6 days ago today that the tax bill was adopted on the floor of Senate. 
   And now we are here with a completed conference report. The work of the Chairman, Finance Committee staff and the Joint Tax Committee staff is to be applauded. They all labored long hours and the result is a bill that I am proud to support. 
   The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that the total budget surplus over the next 10 years will be $2.9 trillion. Nearly a trillion dollars ($996 billion) of that surplus ($996 billion) comes from overpayments of income and estate taxes. 
   What this tax bill does is return barely 25 percent of the surplus tax payments and return that money to the American taxpayer. All of the $1.9 trillion Social Security surplus will be used solely for preserving Social Security. And, as a result of this bill, we have more than $200 billion available for saving Medicare and paying down part of the debt. 
   Mr. President, yesterday, President Clinton reiterated that he will veto this bill because he believes the tax refund is too large. 
   The fact is that what the President wants to do is not provide a tax refund to the American public, but instead he wants to use the surplus to finance $1 trillion in new federal spending. And despite his claim that he wants to cut taxes by $300 billion, CBO scored the President's budget as actually raising taxes by $100 billion over the next 10 years. 
   In other words, at a time when we are running real surpluses in the hundreds of billions, the President comes along and wants to impose even higher taxes on the American people so he can finance more big government. 
   The bill before us should not be vetoed because it provides a tax refund to every single American who pays taxes. The lion's share of the tax cut--nearly $400 billion--results from cutting the 15 percent rate to 14 percent and the near elimination of the marriage penalty. 
   Is that what President Clinton objects to--reducing the tax rate paid by the lowest income taxpayers? Or does the President object to elimination of the marriage penalty? That must be the case Mr. President, because if the President had his way and we cut taxes by $300 billion, we could not eliminate the marriage penalty; we could not cut the rate paid by the lowest income earners. 
   The bill also provides rate relief for all bracket taxpayers over the next 10 years. A modest 1 percent reduction in all tax rates is surely something we can afford with a trillion dollar surplus. I find it hard to believe that the President would object to such a modest change. 
   The conference report also contains the Senate provisions that up the limit on contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) to $5,000. Moreover, it retains the provision in our bill that allows increased contributions by people over 50. 
   In recent months, we have seen that the American savings rate is actually a negative number. These incentives could well serve to increase our savings rate. Is that what President Clinton objects to--enhancing retirement savings incentives? 
   Or does the President object to the health care provisions in this bill. Health care changes that bring a much needed level of equity to the tax code? 
   Allowing the self employed to deduct 100 percent of the cost of health insurance finally brings small business to parity with large corporations. 
   And for the first time in our history, employees who pay for more than half of their own health insurance will be able to take an above-the-line deduction for those costs. 
   I thought the President was so concerned about the uninsured? Why would he veto a tax bill that finally provides health equity to employees and small business owners? 
   The conference report will also serve to continue the flow of money into equity markets by cutting the capital gains rate to 18 percent for all transactions that took place after January 1, 1999. I believe the capital gains rates should be even lower, but with the resources at hand this is an appropriate change. 
   One of the most important changes in the conference report is the phase out and ultimately, in 2009 the elimination of the estate tax. This onerous tax punishes the hard work of many Americans and the death of this tax is long overdue. Confiscatory estate tax rates of 55 percent should, if this bill becomes law, finally be a relic of history. 
   This conference report will be sent to the President when we return in September. He has one month to reconsider his reckless veto threat. The American people deserve a tax refund. This conference report provides very modest and long overdue relief. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and I ask the President to reconsider his veto threat.

   I refer to the fact that in some cases the IRS has taken what I believe is an unreasonable and unrealistic position regarding the tax accounting of sales commissions paid by providers of commercial mobile telephone service for enrolling customers. In the cases I refer to, IRS has contended that these costs should be capitalized and amortized over the average customer life, rather than deducted.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is certainly true. The Committee currently has no analysis of the need for such a cost share nor of the state-by-state or national impact of such a requirement. 
   Although the State of Alaska has established a state ``Trust Fund'' to contribute a significant amount to the State's Weatherization efforts, it would be imperative that we ascertain the ability of other States to undertake such commitments before deciding on a change that could bring an end to Weatherization services throughout the nation. 
   Of course, a federal program that can leverage non-federal funds and attract other partners always has a stronger case for appropriations. Is the Senator from New Mexico informed as to whether any states have many such resources in their Weatherization program?

I hope the floor managers can give us assurance that the Senate Conferees will convey our concerns to their House counterparts and reject this language in Conference.

The program, held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in conjunction with the Center for Excellence in Education, prepares students to be future world leaders, advancing science and technology on every level. 
   Christopher was one of 50 high school students selected for this program from across the country. All of the students considered for the program scored in the top one percent of those taking the PSAT exam. He shows extremely well rounded extra-curricular activities along with a strong academic background. 
   I am proud to see young people such as Christopher attaining academic success at a young age. It gives me hope and faith to see our education system producing individuals that have the capability to lead our country into the next millennium. 
   I believe it is important that we congratulate Christopher and all the students selected for this elite program. I also want to congratulate the Center for Excellence in Education and MIT for continuing their work of advancing our country's work in science and technology. I am confident that Christopher will take full advantage of the opportunities before him, and again my congratulations to him.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the issue before us today is whether we should replace the Finance Committee's tax relief bill with a smaller $500 billion tax relief bill. I commend the authors of the amendment for their effort to provide tax relief to the American people, but I believe very strongly that the Finance Committee bill is a better, balanced approach. 
   Let's examine it for a moment. For example, middle-class families would receive far less relief under the $500 billion amendment because the 15-percent bracket is not reduced. Moreover, the marriage penalty relief in this amendment will not affect the 30 percent of married couples who itemize deductions. 
   The biggest flaw in the authors' approach is their belief that this $500 billion tax cut would be approved by our President. He has stated already he would not sign a tax bill, a $500 billion tax bill that cuts taxes by more than $300 billion. And the Director of the OMB has indicated that a $500 billion tax cut would be vetoed. So we have a veto threat. 
   We also have a responsibility to the American taxpayer. As a member of the Finance Committee, I rise in strong support of the Taxpayer Refund Act as proposed by Finance Chairman ROTH. I commend his chairmanship, the professional staff, and the Joint Tax Committee staff who have worked so hard in putting this together. It has been very difficult, but it is fair, it is balanced, and it is growing in support, as Americans and Members of this body recognize its contribution from the standpoint of fairness and equity. Everybody shares. Everybody benefits. It is a great opportunity for the American people to share in this prosperity associated with the surplus. 
   The Roth bill gives the overtaxed American family a refund of the taxes they are now overpaying to the Federal Government 
   which has resulted in the surplus. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the total budget surplus over the next 10 years will be $2.9 trillion. Nearly $1 trillion--that is, about $996 billion--of that surplus comes from overpayments of income and estate taxes. The American people should share. They know to whom this refund belongs. It is an obligation of this body to give some of it back. 
   What Senator ROTH and my colleagues on the Finance Committee have done in this bill is to take about $791 billion of those tax overpayments and return that money to the American people, the hard-working American taxpayers. All of the $1.9 trillion Social Security surplus will be used solely for preserving Social Security. As a result of this bill, we will have more than $200 billion available for saving Medicare and paying down part of the debt. 
   We have heard from the President that he will veto this bill because the tax refund is too large, and the liberal Washington press mindlessly parrot the President's statement and argue that we should not provide such a large refund. 
   First of all, the President wasn't very supportive of any kind of a refund. He is coming around now. Think of the media, the media that parrot an argument that has no foundation, that  somehow it is wrong for the American people to have a tax refund. Think about that for a moment. What is wrong with the American people sharing in this surplus? After all, it belongs to them. What do you do if you get a tax refund? What do you do if your taxes are reduced? Well, you have a couple of alternatives. You can save it, or you can go out and buy something, spend something. That is going to increase somebody's inventory. Go out and buy a new bicycle; somebody has to put in more bicycles. 
   The point is that it addresses an alternative for the American people. We should save more. We are going to have an opportunity to save more. 
   The Democrats automatically jump to a conclusion: Interest rates are going to go up. There is no proof of that. There is no indication of that. That is scare tactics, Mr. President. What is wrong with the American people having more dollars in their jeans to spend or save if they wish?

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will yield at the end of my statement. I will be happy to at that time. 
   We only have to go back to December of 1980, under the Carter administration. Some people have forgotten. Do you remember what the inflation rate was? The inflation rate was better than 11 percent. Interest on the prime rate in this country was 20.5 percent. Imagine that. What was that due to? Partially the oil shock. So here we have an opportunity where we can have a significant refund, and the beneficiary is the American people. 
   The fact is that what the President wants us to do is not to provide a tax refund to the American people. Instead, he wants to take that surplus to finance $1 trillion in new spending. Despite his claim that he wants to cut taxes by $300 billion, CBO has scored the President's budget as actually raising taxes by $100 billion over the next 10 years. In other words, at a time when we are running a real surplus in the hundreds of billions of dollars, this President comes along and wants to impose even more higher taxes on the American people so he can finance a big and growing Government. 
   The bill before us should not be vetoed because it provides a tax refund to every single American who pays taxes. The lion's share of the tax cut, more than $410 billion, results from cutting the 15-percent rate to the 14-percent rate and the almost total elimination of the marriage penalty. Is that what President Clinton objects to--reducing the tax rate paid by the lowest income taxpayer? Or does the President object to elimination of the marriage penalty? That must be the case, because if our President had his way and we cut taxes by $300 billion, we could not eliminate the marriage penalty, we could not cut the rate paid by the lowest income earners. 
   When the baby boomers are set to retire in 11 years, this bill expands retirement incentives, allows increased competition by people over 50 years of age. 
   I commend the chairman, Mr. ROTH, for upping the limit on contributions to IRAs to $5,000. It has been over 20 years since we raised the $2,000 IRA limit. Upping the limit to $5,000 is long overdue, and it is incentive for the American people to save for retirement. 
   In recent months we have seen that America's savings rate is actually a negative number. These incentives could well serve to increase our savings rate. Is that what President Clinton objects to--retirement savings incentives? Or does the President object to the health care provisions in this bill, health care changes that bring a much-needed level of equity to the Tax Code? 
   Allowing the self-employed to deduct 100 percent of the cost of health insurance finally brings small businesses to parity with large corporations. What is wrong with that? For the first time in our history, under the bill, employees who pay for more than half of their own health insurance will be able to take an above-the-line deduction for those costs. It sounds fair to me. I thought the President was so concerned about the uninsured. Why would he, if he was that concerned, veto a tax bill that finally provides health equity to employees and small business owners? I ask that question of the President. 
   Much overlooked in this bill are the more than $12 billion in educational changes that will make it easier for graduates to pay for their student loans. In addition, more than $1 billion of this bill will help communities construct new schools. Does the President object to that?

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this is deja vu all over again, with the exception of the former Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Bumpers, who obviously led this charge before. 
   I have heard things on the floor of the Senate tonight that are so inaccurate that I am surprised. Some have suggested that cyanide is poured on the grounds of our mines in this country, that there are 12,000 streams that have been polluted and damaged from our mining industry--and ruined, I think was the terminology used. These are totally inaccurate, false statements. 
   They are rock. There is no cyanide from the mining industry leaching out in the area where mining has occurred. They are all closed systems. 
   These are emotional appeals based not on fact but on fiction. They are directed by misleading environmentalists who have decided the mining industry and America's can-do spirit and technology can't take resources from the ground and do it properly. 
   We are not talking about a mining bill. We are talking about the proposal of the Senator from Washington which would limit what the Solicitor has proposed--one site, one mill site in a mining claim. 
   The reality is we will shut down the industry. That is all there is to it. Companies cannot operate the industry on that kind of a land availability. 
   They generalize in their criticism. They talk about Superfund, the ground water contamination. There are 55,650 sites. These are sites where mining has occurred. Let's look at their record. Reclaimed or benign, 34 percent, 194,000; landscaped disturbances, the landscape retakes its ability for regeneration, 41 percent; safety hazard, 116,000, 20 percent; surface water contamination, 2.6 percent; ground water contamination, eighty-nine one-hundredths; Superfund, eighty-nine one-hundredths. 
   My point is this is not a crass dereliction of responsibility. This is the mining industry's history as evaluated by the U.S. Abandoned Mines. Certainly we have exceptions on past practices. 
   To suggest cyanide is leaching out, to suggest we have an irresponsible industry, to suggest the States are not doing their jobs--and the States obviously oversee reclamation; they oversee the mining permits--and to try to kill the industry with a proposal that is absolutely inaccurate, impractical, and unrealistic is beyond me. I don't think it deserves the time of the Senate today. 
   Nevertheless, that is where we are. This creates an impossible situation. If we want to run the mining industry offshore, this is the way to do it. Canada did it by a gross royalty. Mexico did it by taxing them. 
   What is the matter with this body? There are 58,000 U.S. jobs, good paying jobs. We need to be a resource-developed country. Otherwise, we will bring them in from South Africa. 
   What happened in South Africa? It speaks for itself. I hope my colleagues recognize what this does. This kills the  mining industry and exports the jobs offshore.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I think this is one of the most significant opportunities this body has had in some time to address an internal disregard for our responsibility. As a consequence, I rise in strong support of S. Res. 160, the resolution, that would overturn the rule XVI precedent the Senate adopted on March 16, 1995, which effectively hijacked the authorization process by allowing Senators to routinely offer legislative amendments on general appropriations bills. 
   Doing a little research, it was less than a year ago when the Senate voted on the 4,000-page, 40-pound, $540 billion omnibus appropriations bill. Not only did that bill contain funding for various Federal agencies including the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, State, and Justice, the District of Columbia, Foreign Ops, Interior, and Labor-HHS; but it also included numerous authorization bills. A few of them contained in that package were the American Competitiveness Act, the Internet Tax Freedom Act, the Internet Decency Act, the Vacancies Act, the reauthorization of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, the Drug Free Workplace Act, the Drug Demand Reauthorization Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act--I could go on and on. 
   In addition, that monstrosity of a bill included tax extender legislation and more than $20 billion of so-called emergency spending. 
   One has to ask the question why we need authorizing committees when we allow appropriations bills to include authorizing legislation. Why should the Finance Committee, for example, exist if the appropriators can include tax legislation in their bills? Why should the Commerce Committee hold meetings when the American Competitiveness Act can be included in an appropriations bill? 
   We have example after example. I recall not so long ago the battle we fought over the fiscal 1998 Interior appropriations. The Clinton administration at that time decided on its own to acquire the Headwaters Forest in northern California--that was at a cost of $315 million--further, the Administration also decided to acquire the New World Mine site in Montana, at a cost of $65 million. 
   I am not going to speak to the merits of these acquisitions, but I am going to speak to the manner in which they were done because here you have an administration that prides itself on public participation. These decisions were made with no congressional involvement. The administration sought to bypass the authorizing committees entirely and have the appropriators essentially just write a check for the purchase of those properties, and that is just what they did. 
   I happen to be chairman of the authorizing committee with jurisdiction, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. I wanted the opportunity for the committee to carefully review the merits of these acquisitions. We tried, but the argument failed, and the authorization and funding were included in the 1998 Interior appropriations bill. That was much to the administration's delight. They got their way. But the public, the process, the committee of jurisdiction, had no opportunity to review these significant purchases, no opportunity to hold hearings, no opportunity for open debate or any type of public review. That is what is wrong with this system. 
   Today we have an opportunity to begin to change that. Moreover, what has happened since this precedent was changed in 1995 is that appropriations bills become far more difficult to pass. As we know--we have seen it lately--they are held hostage to nonappropriations issues, and the delays in getting them completed raise the specter of a Government shutdown at the end of each session. We saw it just 3 weeks ago, an example of how authorizing legislation stands in the way of the appropriations process. 
   For nearly a full week, the agriculture appropriations bill was stalled because Members on the other side of the aisle demanded we consider the Patients' Bill of Rights. As a result, the Senate had to stop the appropriations process for an entire week as we debated this important health issue. 
   I happen to support the Patients' Bill of Rights that was adopted by the Senate. I believe we should, first of all, have completed all of the appropriations bills before we engaged in that debate and other debates. As of today, we still have not moved forward on the agriculture bill. 
   Because of the delays in the appropriations process, what has been happening in recent years is that when the end of the fiscal year approaches, the appropriators and the leadership have to come together to engage in a negotiation with the White House to ensure the Government continues to function. As was demonstrated last year, authorizing bills and appropriations bills get mixed in together in a single omnibus bill which is negotiated by a hand-picked group of people. Authorizers do not participate in the process and, therefore, have no say in the substance of the legislation. 
   This is wrong. This is not the way the Senate was set up to function. 
   As a consequence, as we look at where we are today, the founders intended the Senate to operate with a representative process with the authorizing committees doing their job. They were not created simply to provide oversight. Those committees do important things such as holding hearings, drafting legislation based on their knowledge gained from such hearings, and that is why we have the structure of the authorization committees because they have expertise and their professional staffs have an expertise on much of the complicated issues before us. If we continue to allow appropriations bills to be laden with authorization legislation, I can assure my colleagues we are going to see a repeat of last year's last-minute omnibus bill. 
   In closing, I will make a reference to how we are seen by the administration, and I am speaking as an authorizer, as chairman of an authorizing committee. 
   One Secretary, Secretary Babbitt, Secretary of the Interior, has become adept at circumventing the Congress. Babbitt has indicated that he is proud of his procedure and proud of the way he is doing it. I quote:  
   ..... ``We've switched the rules of the game. We're not trying to do anything legislatively,'' says Babbitt.  
   That is the National Journal, May 22, 1999. 
   A further quote from Secretary Babbitt:  
   One of the hardest things to divine is the intent of Congress because most of the time ..... legislation is put together usually in kind of a House/Senate kind of thing where it's the munchkins--  
   The munchkins, Mr. President--  
   who actually draft this legislation at midnight in a conference committee and it goes out.  
   It is a statement from Cobel v. Babbitt, page 3668. 
   Lastly, from Secretary Babbitt:  
   I am on record around this town as saying that the real business on these issues is done in the appropriation committees, and I, I am a regular and frequent participant at all levels in those. That's, that's where the action  is, that's where things get done. The authorizing committees are partisan wrangles of the first order. I mean, nothing ever gets done on any level in the authorizing committees.

   It is my hope we will overturn this precedent and return the 
   Senate to the way it has operated for nearly all of its history. Otherwise, we might just as well abandon our authorizing committees and enlarge the size of the Appropriations Committee to all 100 Members.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I very much appreciate my friend from Nevada highlighting the inequity associated with the responsibility of the authorizers because, as I indicated in my statement, we get down to a situation where we are out of time and, as I stated, a few hand-picked individuals come together with the White House and basically negotiate a resolve with no participation from the authorizers. As a consequence, as he pointed out, we cannot read the material. It is basically put together simultaneously with the process of negotiation. We are shortchanging our responsibility. I very much appreciate his attention given to this matter.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in the winter of 1973, when I was a commercial banker in Fairbanks, AK, pioneer Joe Redington, Sr., came into our offices with an interesting proposition. He was seeking a bank loan to start a sled dog race to commemorate the infamous diphtheria serum run that left Nenana in 1925 to deliver 20 pounds to serum to Nome to stop a deadly outbreak of the disease. 
   Joe worked as a commercial fishermen and miner and had no collateral to speak of--and no real chance of getting the $50,000 loan. He couldn't accurately predict the costs of the race of forecast the sponsor interest, and he couldn't even guarantee that any mushers would reach the finish line in Nome. 
   But Joe Redington had a dream. More importantly, Redington was a many you knew would accomplish anything he set his mind to. His infectious enthusiasm and ``can-do'' attitude prompted me to take a chance and make a loan to help fund the world's longest sled dog race--the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. 
   Joe Redington got the loan and paid ti back. I do regret however, having to come to the Senate floor today to note the passing of Joe Redington, Sr., a true giant of Alaska, who died June 24, at age 82 at his home in Knik. Alaska. 
   Redington's life is really a microcosm of Alaska's modern history. Born February 1, 1917, in rural Oklahoma, his family wandered the country looking for farm work until they settled in Bucks County, Pennsylvania in the late 1920s. In 1948 after a stint in World War II, Redington and wife, Vi, drove two Jeeps to Alaska and never looked back. 
   During territorial days and the early years of statehood, Joe Redington helped turn dog mushing--then a transportation necessity in central and rural Alaska--into the state's official sport. Redington and his wife, Vi, were dedicated breeders for nearly four decades. Offspring of their dogs have filled many kennels in Alaska and the Lower 48 with racing pups. 
   In 1967 he and the late Dorothy Page teamed to promote a Centennial Iditarod Sled Dog Race in honor of the 100th Anniversary of Alaska's purchase from Russia. The 56-mile race around the Big Lake--Wasilla area was a great success. The Centennial's success spurred the idea for the Iditarod. 
   But Redington's Iditarod dream was realized when 34 mushers left Anchorage on March 3, 1973 for the inaugural Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. The 1,100-mile race took the adventurous mushers across some of the roughest terrain in Alaska. Twenty-two mushers crossed the finish line in Nome on April 3 with the top finishers sharing the $50,000 purse. In 1976, Redington's determination and dedication to the Iditarod race, led Congress to designate the Iditarod Trail as a National Historic Trail. The race has been run every March since 1973. 
   Joe Redington Sr., at age 57, ran his first Iditarod in 1974 and ran in every race until 1992. At age 80, Redington ran in his 19th and final Iditarod in 1997 where he finished a very respectable 36th. His finish time was 13 days, 4 hours and 18 minutes--nearly 17 days faster than  the winners time of the first Iditarod in 1973. While Redington never won the Iditarod, he did finished in fifth palace, four times--in 1975, 1977, 1978 and 1988. And he was among the top 10 finishers, seven times. 
   Joe was remarkable off the race course, as well. At age 62 he scaled Alaska's Mount McKinley, keeping up with then 20-year-old musher, and four-time Iditarod champion, Susan Butcher. Redington made it to the peak of the 20,230 foot peak, a monumental task for a person of any age. 
   After hearing of Redington passing, fellow musher DeeDee Jonrowe was quoted in the Fairbanks News Miner as saying, ``Joe never thought (anything) wasn't possible. If you had a dream, he was about making it happen for you. He wasn't about telling you the pitfalls.'' 
   Joe Redington, Sr. was a good, kind and gentle soul. He was soft of voice, but had a big heart--he was a fitting recipient of the Alaskan of the Year Award in 1995. Joe came down with esophagus cancer in 1997, but until a month ago he was still planning to complete in the year 2000 Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. 
   While Joe Redington, Sr, won't be racing in the 2000 Iditarod, his spirit surely will light the way to Nome for mushers each March. More importantly, his legacy of hard work and never giving up will be with all Alsakans as we continue our efforts to improve the land that we love. ..... The land of The Last Fontier.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my friend, Senator DOMENICI. 
   Yesterday we had an opportunity to discuss the pending amendment at some length. I think I spoke for some 45 minutes, so I will not repeat what I said yesterday, but I am going to focus in on why we need this amendment. 
   This whole issue associated with the lack of security in our labs has received a lot of attention over the last several months. My committee, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, has held nine hearings. We had the pleasure of getting together with four other committees--the Government Affairs Committee, the Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee, joining with the Energy Committee--and it was the first time we had ever assembled four committees together. We had over 30 Senators present. So there has been a good deal of time, effort, and examination on this matter. 
   I am very pleased to join Senator DOMENICI, Senator KYL, and a number of other cosponsors, including Senators KERREY, LOTT, FEINSTEIN, SMITH, GREGG, HUTCHINSON, SHELBY, WARNER, BUNNING, HELMS, FITZGERALD, SPECTER, THOMPSON, and others in bringing this matter before the Senate. 
   We need this amendment because time is passing. This report, the Rudman report, entitled ``Science At Its Best, Security At Its Worst,'' in effect says it all. This was the expert panel authorized by the President, a special investigative panel of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board headed by former Senator Rudman. Again, the emphasis is on the title, recognizing that science has contributed probably the best in the world at the labs, but security at its worst. 
   Now, why do we need this amendment? Why do we need it now? 
   I will be very brief. I am going to give you a few quotes from the Rudman report.  
   Organizational disarray, managerial neglect and a culture of arrogance, both at the Department of Energy headquarters and the labs themselves, conspired to create an espionage scandal waiting to happen.  
   Further from the report:  
   The Department of Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy that has proven it is incapable of reforming itself.  
   Further:  
   Accountability at the Department of Energy labs has been spread so thinly and erratically that it is now almost impossible to find.  
   That is the key word--``accountability.'' We had no accountability, as we look back on the espionage charges associated with the alleged Wen Ho Lee affair, no accountability. There it is. 
   Further, I quote:  
   Never have the members of the special investigative panel witnessed a bureaucratic  culture so thoroughly saturated with cynicism and disregard for authority.  
   Further, I quote:  
   Never before has this panel found such a cavalier attitude toward one of the most serious responsibilities in the Federal Government: control of the design information relating to nuclear weapons.  
   Further, I quote:  
   Never before has the panel found an agency with the bureaucratic insolence to disrupt, delay and resist implementation of a presidential directive on security.  
   These are but a few of the quotes from the Rudman report. These few quotes and the full report itself speak eloquently about the need for this amendment, the justification for this amendment. While considering whether to vote for or against this amendment and the motion to invoke cloture, there is really only one relevant question: Do you want to put an end to lax management practices at the Department of Energy that have contributed to the poor security? In other words, do you want to fix it? Or do you want to do everything you can to prevent espionage from occurring again, further damaging national security? 
   I urge Members to vote for cloture.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to vote against the motion to discharge the Committee on Finance from further consideration of the resolution disapproving the extension of the Jackson-Vanik waiver for Vietnam. 
   The chairman of the Committee on Finance, Senator Roth, has explained why this is a premature and unnecessary motion because the underlying resolution is privileged, and if the House passes either resolution, then the full Senate would be required to take up the resolution. It is expected that the full House will vote on the measure soon. So let's keep our attention on the very important and timely legislation currently being considered by the Senate. 
   But I also want to stress that even if this were the right time to consider the Jackson-Vanik waiver, the Senate should not adopt a resolution of disapproval. Although it is often forgotten in the debate over normal trade relations, the Jackson-Vanik waiver's chief objective is promoting freedom of emigration. 
   The President extended Vietnam's Jackson-Vanik waiver because he determined that doing so would substantially promote greater freedom of emigration in the future in Vietnam. I support this determination because of Vietnam's record of progress on emigration and on Vietnam's continued and intensified cooperation on U.S. refugee programs. 
   According to testimony by the U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam, Pete Peterson, Vietnam's emigration policy has opened considerably in the last decade and a half. As a consequence, over 500,000 Vietnamese have emigrated as refugees or immigrants to the United States under the Orderly Departure Program, and only a small number of refugee applications remain. 
   So on the merits, the waiver is justified. But I also believe that since it was first granted in March 1998, the Jackson-Vanik waiver has been an essential component of our policy of engagement and has directly furthered progress with Vietnam on furthering U.S. policy goals. Goals which include, first and foremost, accounting for the missing from the Vietnam war--our MIAs, promoting regional stability, improving respect for human rights, and opening markets for U.S. business. 
   I support the President's decision because I continue to believe, and the evidence supports, that increased access to Vietnam leads to increase progress on the accounting issue. 
   Resolvin the fate of our MIAs has been, and will remain, the highest priority for our government. This nation owes that to the men and the families of the men that made the ultimate sacrifice for their country and for freedom. 
   In pursuit of that goal, I have traveled to Vietnam three times and I 
   held over 40 hours of hearings on the issue in 1986 as chairman of the Veterans' Committee. The comparison between the situation in 1986 and today is dramatic. 
   In 1986, I was appalled to learn that we had no first hand information about the fate of POW/MIAs because we had no access to the Vietnamese government or to its military archives or prisons. We could not travel to crash sites. We had no opportunity to interview Vietnamese individuals or officials. 
   In 1993, opponents of ending our isolationist policy argued that lifting the trade embargo would mean an end to Vietnamese cooperation. This is distinctly not the case. American Joint Task Force--Full Accounting (JTF-FA) personnel located in Hanoi have access to Vietnam's government and to its military archives and prisons. They freely travel to crash sites and interview Vietnamese citizens and officials. 
   During the post-embargo period, the Vietnam Government cooperated on other issues as well, including resolving millions of dollars in diplomatic property and private claims of Americans who lost property at the end of the war. 
   The Jackson-Vanik waiver has helped the U.S. government influence Vietnam's progress toward an open, market-oriented economy. It has also benefited U.S. companies by making available a number of U.S. Government trade promotion and investment support programs that enhance their ability to compete in this potentially important market. And I hope that soon our trade negotiators will be able to complete a sound, commercially viable trade agreement with Vietnam that will further expand market opportunities for American companies. 
   Before I close, let me urge my colleagues who may be unsure about their vote to consult with the U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam, Pete Peterson. Ambassador Peterson, a Vietnam veteran who himself was a prisoner of war, and who also served in the House of Representatives, has been a tireless advocate of U.S. interests in Vietnam. With his background and experience, his counsel should be trusted. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against the motion to discharge.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on behalf of my friend and colleague, Senator LANDRIEU, let me briefly comment on the status of the OCS revenuesharing legislation that we introduced some time ago. This is a significant addition to a much-needed reform and, as a consequence, it has been termed as the Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1999. 
   The bill itself reinvests OCS revenues. When I say ``reinvests,'' I am specifically noting the reality associated from where this revenue comes. It comes from OCS activities of some States. It could include other States if indeed they wanted to have OCS activity exploration and production off of their individual shores. Some of the States have chosen not to. I appreciate and recognize their reluctance. But let's be realistic and recognize that in order to have a successful Conservation and Reinvestment Act, we have to have a continuation of OCS revenues occurring off the shores of some of our States--Louisiana, Mississippi, and other States. 
   My State of Alaska has a very small OCS activity; most of our activities are on land. But it is interesting to note the breadth of support for this legislation, which is related, to some extent, to those States that see an opportunity to generate a source of revenue. That is fine. That is the way Senator LANDRIEU and I constructed the legislation. Make no mistake about it, in order for it to be successful, we have to have, and encourage, OCS revenuesharing, as we have off the coast of Texas, and other States that I could mention. 
   This is a coastal impact assistance and State coastal program funding mechanism for the land and water conservation fund, 
   including fulfilling a long-delayed promise of support for State, local, and urban park and recreation facilities, as well as State wildlife programs. 
   We have tried to cover a broad area of need, and I commend the Senator from Louisiana, Senator LANDRIEU, for her extraordinary ability to encompass, if you will, the various broad interest groups.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Senator from Louisiana. 
   At the risk of understating the importance of this bill, what we have attempted to do is find a balance, develop a compromise; but each time we accommodate one group's special interest associated with this, there is a reaction from another group that perhaps gave us support and is concerned that we have gone too far in any one area. 
   As chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, my goal and objective in working with Senator LANDRIEU is to report a bill to the Senate floor. We must have a bipartisan bill. The bill is going to have to remedy the existing inequity in the distribution of OCS revenues. It is going to have to provide funds for State conservation programs. It is going to have to provide guarantees for a role of Congress in Federal land acquisition. In other words, Congress is going to have to have something to say about Federal land acquisition and purchases. Finally, it is going to have to assure westerners that there will be no gain of Federal land in their States--no gain of Federal land in the Western States. 
   This isn't going to be easy, but I think, working with Senator LANDRIEU and others, it is going to be worth the effort. Therefore, I look forward to working with my colleagues on this exciting opportunity, this exciting legislation. Previously, all of the OCS revenue has gone into the general fund. Now we have an opportunity to address this with some meaningful legislation that involves the OCS impact assistance, land and water conservation fund amendments, and the wildlife conservation fund under a formula that has been agreed upon. 
   I encourage my colleagues, in consideration of this language, to allow the local people to make the decision, not a disinterested bureaucracy, a Federal Government that dictates one size fits all. 
   I thank my colleague, the Senator from Louisiana, for her graciousness in allowing me this time and for her efforts to bring this before the body. I thank the majority leader, Senator LOTT, as well. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Ms. LANDRIEU addressed the Chair.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I also rise to urge my colleagues to vote against the motion to discharge the Committee on Finance from further consideration of the resolution disapproving the extension of the Jackson-Vanik waiver authority for normal trade relations with China. 
   Beyond the procedural problems my colleagues outlined regarding taking up this measure today, there are clear and crucial reasons to oppose this motion because the underlying disapproval resolution should also be opposed on its merits. 
   Let me state that I agree with my colleague on the goals he seeks to achieve by pursuing this motion, but I disagree with his methods. 
   I too am concerned about the recent espionage reports and the implications for our national security. 
   I too am concerned about China's destabilizing weapons sales. 
   I too want China to resolve peacefully her territorial disagreements in the South China Sea. 
   I too want China to lower barriers to U.S. exports and to reduce her trade surplus with the United States. 
   I too want China to end her military threats against Taiwan and to resolve peacefully her differences with Taipei. 
   And I too want China to respect the basic human rights of its citizens. 
   But I do not believe that withdrawing normal trade relations status will force China to satisfy any of our objectives. Indeed, sanctioning China by withdrawing NTR runs the risk of making that country more belligerent and less cooperative on these and other issues. 
   Moreover, revoking NTR would be contrary to American interests and the interests of the American people. 
   Experience shows that unilateral trade sanctions generally don't work. The chances of success only improve when sanctions are applied in cooperation with our major allies. However, not one of these allies is even debating whether to withdraw NTR status from China. 
   Let's be clear on this point. If we revoke NTR status for China, Beijing would certainly be hurt, but so too would the United States. 
   As a result of withdrawing NTR, U.S. duties on goods imported from China would immediately rise to the tariff rates established under the highly protectionist, depression-era Smoot-Hawley tariff law. 
   Because NTR is provided on a reciprocal basis, China would respond to higher tariffs on her goods by slapping higher tariffs on U.S. goods. Such a move will slam the door shut on U.S. exports to the Chinese market--the fastest-growing market in the world for the highly competitive American aircraft, telecommunications, and automotive equipment industries. 
   These export opportunities will go instead to the Europeans, the Japanese,  the Canadians and firms from all the other countries in the world which continue normal commercial relations with China. 
   In addition to severely damaging U.S. exporters, the small and large American firms that have invested billions of dollars to penetrate the Chinese market would see their efforts and investments jeopardized. 
   The economic fallout from withdrawing China's NTR status is not only going to hit American companies, but also American consumers. Our lowest income citizens, in particular, would suffer from the dramatically higher prices they will have to pay for a variety of basic goods as a direct result of the imposition of substantially higher duties on Chinese imports. 
   There are those who claim that pricing Chinese goods out of our market through higher duties would be beneficial because the products we now import from China would be produced in the United States. But any business person will tell you the truth is that in almost all cases imports from China will be replaced not by American products but rather imports from other developing countries. 
   We must also recognize that cutting ourselves off from China by withdrawing NTR will severely limit our ability influence developments in China, including how China treat its citizens and whether it permits the development of a freer society. 
   Mr. President, it is also important to recognize that the United States already has specific, measured and targeted tools at our disposal that allow us to address problems with China without resorting to the indiscriminate and destructive approach of revoking NTR. 
   For example, we can adopt the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski amendment to reorganize the Department of Energy to prevent further losses at our national weapons laboratories. 
   We can involve targeted Section 301 sanctions for discrete discriminatory and unreasonable Chinese trade practices. 
   We can continue to expose and condemn China's repressive human rights record in this Chamber and in organizations around the world. 
   We can counter China's threats to Taiwan by considering sales of upgraded defensive weaponry to Taipei, as well as by reaffirming our unwavering commitment to a peaceful resolution of the dispute between Taiwan and China in the context of our one China policy. 
   We can rely on international law and the shared interests of the countries of Southeast Asia to counter aggressive Chinese territorial claims. 
   I want to note here, moreover, that neither the Taiwanese--who are never shy about voicing their opinions to Members of Congress--nor the countries of ASEAN which have territorial disputes with China, support the United States revoking NTR for China. 
   The bottom line, Mr. President, is that revoking NTR would not advance the goals for China which I share with my colleague, and will likely worsen our problems with China. And it would put at risk hundreds of thousands of American jobs and billions of dollars worth of American exports and investments. 
   With so much to lose and nothing gained, I urge my colleagues to vote against this motion.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. 
   Madam President, I rise in support of the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski-Kerrey  amendment. I will first identify the need for the amendment. 
   What we found in this issue concerning the Department of Energy is lack of accountability. What this amendment will do, in a nutshell, is to create a single agency in the Department of Energy, an Agency for Nuclear Stewardship, that will undertake all activities of our nuclear weapons laboratories programs, including the nuclear weapons laboratories themselves. It puts one person in charge, and that will be the Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship. That is the person in charge of and responsible for all aspects of the new Agency for Nuclear Stewardship. It creates a clear chain of command, a new Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship solely and directly reporting to the Secretary of Energy. 
   Why do we need this? I believe all my colleagues will agree that the Department of Energy, as far as its security arrangements are concerned, is badly broken. To suggest that we should take time to evaluate at greater length when we have in the report of the investigative panel, the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board--a report which I have before me entitled ``Science At Its Best, Security At Its Worst.'' 
   I am very proud of the role of the laboratories as far as science is concerned, but what we have is a severe breach of our national security. 
   In summary, the amendment would create a new agency within the Department of Energy called the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship. 
   The Agency for Nuclear Stewardship would be semiautonomous because it would be responsible for all of its activities. It provides that the Secretary of Energy shall be responsible for all policies of the agency; that the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship, headed by the Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship, would be just that, responsible, again, to the Secretary of Energy. The Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship shall report solely and directly to the Secretary; and that individual shall be subject to the supervision and direction of the Secretary. 
   Make no mistake about it, the chain of command is to the Secretary of Energy. The Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship will have authority over all programs at the Department of Energy related to nuclear weapons, nonproliferation, and fissile material disposition. 
   The agency's semiautonomy, as recommended by the Rudman report, is created by making all employees of the agency accountable to the Secretary and Under Secretary of Energy but not to other officials of the Department of Energy outside the agency. 
   Specifically, the language reads:  
   All personnel of the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship, in carrying out any function of the agency, shall be responsible to and subject to the supervision and direction of the Secretary and the Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship, or his designee within the agency, and shall not be responsible to or subject to the supervision or direction of any other officer, employee or agent of any other part of the Department of Energy.  
   The Secretary, however, may direct other officials, other departments who are not within the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship, to review the agency's programs and to make recommendations to the Secretary regarding the administration of such programs, including consistency with other similar programs and activities in the Department. 
   The Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship will have three deputy directors who will manage programs in the following areas: 
   First, Defense programs; that is, the lab directors and the heads of the production and test sites will report directly to this person; second, the nonproliferation and fissile materials disposition; and third, the naval reactors. 
   The Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship will appoint chiefs of--and they are as follows--first, counterintelligence--this must be a senior FBI executive whose selection must be approved by the Secretary of Energy and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation--second, is security; and third is intelligence. 
   These three chiefs shall report to the Under Secretary and shall have, statutorily provided, direct access to the Secretary and all other officials of the Department and its contractors concerning these matters. It requires the Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship to report annually to the Congress regarding the status and effectiveness of security and counterintelligence programs at the nuclear weapons facilities and laboratories, the adequacy of the Department of Energy procedures and policy for protecting national security information, and whether each DOE National Laboratory and nuclear weapons production test site is in full compliance with all departmental security requirements, and, if not, what measures are being taken to bring the lab into compliance--security violators at the nuclear weapons facilities and laboratories, foreign visitors at the nuclear weapons facilities and laboratories. 
   In other words, what we have is a complete listing of requirements for the Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship to report annually to the Congress. So not only will he report to the Secretary but he will report to the Congress. 
   It requires the Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship to 
   keep the Secretary and the Congress fully and currently informed regarding losses of national security information and requires every employee of the Department of Energy, the National Laboratories, or associated contractors to alert the Under Secretary whenever they believe there is a threat to or a loss of national security information. 
   In order to address concerns that Department of Energy officials were blocked from notifying Congress of security and counterintelligence breaches, the amendment contains a provision stating that the Under Secretary shall not be required to obtain the approval of any DOE official except the Secretary before delivering these reports to the Congress and, likewise, prohibits any other Department or agency from interfering. 
   As we look over the history of the debacle associated with the breach of our national security regarding the laboratories, clearly, we have case after case, as we look to the former Secretaries, where there was a lack of an effective transfer of information, transfer of security matters, and just the transfer of everyday activities associated with responsibility and accountability. The system failed. 
   The system failed because various people did not have access to the Secretary who were in charge of responsible security areas that mandated that they have such access in order to complete the communication within the chain of command. 
   As a consequence, I support this amendment. We need this amendment to protect the national security. We need it to keep our nuclear weapons secrets from falling into the wrong hands. We have already suffered a major loss of our nuclear weapons secrets. 
   According to the House Select Committee, the Cox report, the Chinese have stolen design information on all of the United States' most advanced nuclear weapons. This is simply unacceptable. 
   The question we now face is: Will we lose more national security information if we do not take action? The answer is: Certainly that we stand greater exposure. The problem is the management of the Department of Energy. The problem is lack of accountability and lack of responsibility. 
   Let me quote from the report of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, the Rudman report. Again, I refer to this report, ``Science at its Best, Security at its Worst.''  
   Organizational disarray, managerial neglect, and a culture of arrogance--both at DOE headquarters and the labs themselves--conspired to create an espionage scandal waiting to happen.  
   This is in the report itself. 
   Further:  
   The Department of Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy that has proven it is incapable of reforming itself.  
   Right out of this report. 
   I quote further:  
   Accountability at the Department of Energy has been spread so thinly and erratically that it is now almost impossible to find.  
   Right out of the report. 
   Further:  
   Never have the members of the Special Investigative Panel witnessed a bureaucratic culture so thoroughly saturated with cynicism and disregard for authority.  
   Further quote:   
   Never before has this panel found such a cavalier attitude toward one of the most serious responsibilities in the federal government--control of the design information relating to nuclear weapons.  
   Further:  
   Never before has the panel found an agency with the bureaucratic insolence to dispute, delay, and resist implementation of a Presidential directive on security.  
   If that isn't evidence enough that the security is at its worst, I do not know what other points to make. To date, the only DOE people who have been removed from their jobs as a consequence of the question of who is accountable are: Wen Ho Lee, who is alleged to have engaged in espionage at Los Alamos, is yet to be even charged with anything--not everyone a security violation; a gentleman by the name of Notra Trulock, the person who uncovered the alleged espionage and pushed perhaps too hard to stop it--which I might add, the Department of Energy felt a little uncomfortable with. 
   He was shuffled off to a sideline position in the Department of Energy because he was too aggressive in bringing this matter to light. A gentleman by the name of Vic Reis, Assistant Secretary of the Department of Energy for Defense Programs, has, I understand, resigned because he disagrees with the officials down there and happens to support the pending amendment, the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski amendment. 
   Not a single high-level bureaucrat at the Department of Energy, the FBI, or the Justice Department has been removed, demoted, or disciplined over this massive failure. One has to wonder with all the talent associated with these agencies who bears the responsibility for failure in this case? 
   The questions we must answer are certainly clear: How long are we willing to put up with this? Do we want to continue with the status quo? Our proposal is pending the cloture vote tomorrow. Those that are in opposition--who feel perhaps a bit uncomfortable with this--do they have a proposal to fix it? Clearly, they don't. We want to fix the problem. 
   For reasons that I fail to understand, the administration is very reluctant to address this problem with a strong proposal for identifying accountability in the Department of Energy. Unfortunately, Secretary Richardson is opposed to our amendment as it stands. When it came up the last time on the defense bill, Secretary Richardson sent two letters threatening a veto by the President. Why doesn't the administration want to do anything significant to correct this problem? They seem to be willing only to rearrange the deck chairs, so to speak. They seem to be willing to make changes, but only those that ultimately result in the status quo. 
   We want to steer the ship in a different direction so that it won't hit another iceberg. This Nation should not have to suffer from another massive loss of our most sensitive nuclear weapons secrets. The President's own intelligence advisory board agrees with our legislative solution. That is what the Rudman report said. 
   Our amendment is patterned after the Rudman report. Let me again quote from this report:  
   The panel is convinced that real and lasting security and counterintelligence reform at the weapons labs is simply unworkable within the Department of Energy's current structure and culture. Further, to achieve the kind of protection that these sensitive labs must have, they and their functions must have their own autonomous operational structure, free of all of the other obligations imposed by the Department of Energy management.  
   Well, today we have a situation where everybody is pointing the finger at everybody else. No one wants to take the responsibility. No one wants to be held accountable. 
   Fundamentally, the issue is how to create accountability and responsibility at the Department of Energy. I encourage my colleagues to examine our amendment because that is just what it does. It creates accountability. It creates responsibility. No longer can we have a situation such as we have seen within the Department, where it is impossible to determine who bears the responsibility for the Wen Ho Lee breach of security. It creates accountability and responsibility by establishing a new Agency for Nuclear Stewardship inside of the Department of Energy to be headed up by a new Under Secretary of Energy. 
   This new agency is now made responsible for all aspects of our nuclear weapons programs, including the previously loosely-managed laboratories. If there is a problem in the future, we will know who to point the finger at, who to hold responsible, a single agency with a single person heading it and in charge of all aspects of nuclear weapons programs. Our amendment also requires the new Under Secretary to report to the FBI and Congress all threats to our national security. No longer will we be kept in the dark, having to pretty much depend on the New York Times to find out what 
   is going on. 
   The Secretary of Energy is uncomfortable with this reorganization. Evidently, his idea is to rely on the same old management team, everyone in charge but no one responsible, no clear identifiable accountability. 
   In conclusion, let me quote the testimony of Mr. Vic Reis. This came up late last week. Mr. Reis is the Assistant Secretary of Energy for Defense Programs. He testified before the Energy Committee last week. 
   I might add, Mr. Reis' responsibility in the line of command is that the lab directors report directly to Mr. Reis. 
   Mr. Reis said:  
   You may recall at previous hearings, Mr. Chairman, you noticed me in the audience and you asked for my opinion as to who or what was to blame for the security issues at the national laboratories. I responded that I didn't think you would find any one individual but that there were organizational structures of the Department of Energy that were so flawed that security lapses are almost inevitable.  
   Now, this is the gentleman to whom heads of the labs report. He says that you can't find any individual to blame. The organizational structure was so flawed that security lapses were inevitable. 
   Then Mr. Reis went on to say:  
   The root cause of the difficulties at the Department of Energy is simply that the Department of Energy has too many disparate missions to be managed effectively as a cohesive organization. The price of gasoline, refrigerant standards, Quarks, nuclear cleanup and nuclear weapons just don't come together naturally. Because of all this multi-layered crosscutting, there is no one accountable for the operation of any part of the organization except the Secretary, and no Secretary has the time to lead the whole thing effectively. By setting up a semi-autonomous agency, many of these problems will go away.  
   Madam President, in short, if you want espionage to continue at the laboratories and maintain the environment where it can occur, then stick with the present system. But if you, like me, want to stop this atmosphere where espionage can flourish, I think you should vote for the motion and invoke cloture for the amendment. 
   What we have here is a situation where I think it is appropriate that we identify where the differences are between the Secretary, Senator KYL, Senator DOMENICI, Senator KERREY, and Senator MURKOWSKI and in our amendment. What we do is we create a single semiautonomous agency, as I have indicated, that reports directly to the Secretary of Energy. The new Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship will be responsible for both setting policy and implementation of policy, subject to the overall supervision and direct control of the Secretary of Energy. 
   I want to make that clear: Subject to the overall supervision and direct control of the Secretary of Energy. 
   Evidently, that is not what the Secretary wants. The Secretary is willing to allow the new Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship to implement policy but not set policy. There is a big difference, implementing and setting. More significantly, the Secretary wants to allow any part of the Department of Energy to set the policies that the new Under Secretary would have to follow. So somebody else is setting it. 
   The Secretary's proposal would violate our fundamental concept; that is, clear and identifiable lines of authority and responsibility--in other words, a direct chain of command. We have been discussing our differences, but so far we seem to be unable to resolve them. 
   There is one other thing I will mention that was said the other day that relates to this matter under discussion. Two current nuclear weapons lab directors and one former lab director said at a hearing that while they could report their problems and issues to Mr. Reis,  who is their supervisor, that Mr. Reis has no clear line of authority to pass those up through the chain of command to the Secretary. 
   So here we have it. This substantiates the justification for our amendment. Here is the gentleman who is responsible to have the input from the lab directors report to him, the three labs, Livermore, Sandia, Los Alamos. 
   But the gentleman in charge, Mr. Reis, under the current structure and chain of command within the Department of Energy, has no clear line of authority to pass those recommendations, those matters, up through the chain of command to the Secretary. So here you have the person that is responsible to get the information from the lab directors, but there is no provision, no requirement, no line of command up to the Secretary so that policy matters can be addressed. That one observation with these three lab directors illustrates the problem we are trying to fix with this legislation. 
   As it stands today, there is no chain or lines of authority and responsibility. Right now, everybody is in charge, but nobody is responsible. I guess it is fair to say there are several missing links, if you will, in the DOE chain of command and authority. The purpose of the amendment is to fix that problem. 
   I often think back to military concept and a ship at sea. Someone is in charge of the CON--in other words, the ship is under the direction of the officer in charge, and he has the CON. There is no question of where the responsibility sets. If he is relieved, the command of the ship is taken over and that person accepts the responsibility. In the DOE, we don't have those clear lines of authority, and that is the justification for the amendment pending before this body today. 
   Is this thing broke to the point where it mandates that the Senate take action? I think it is fair to say that the answer is clearly yes. The ineptness, the bungling, the pure mismanagement at all levels are things that have occurred within this agency. The Department of Energy never took the most basic precautions to guard against the theft of the nuclear secrets. The FBI conducted feeble investigations. The Department of Justice, led by Attorney General Reno, virtually ignored requests for warrants to search Wen Ho Lee's computers. What we have here are the results of one of the worst cases in the history of this Nation of our national security being jeopardized. 
   I have held about 9 hearings as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee on these matters, and three important discoveries were made by my committee. First, the Department of Energy and the FBI bungled the computer waiver issue. I have a chart here. The lab directors, the attorneys, and directors of counterintelligence all agree that the DOE had the authority to search Lee's computer because he signed a waiver. Well, this is the waiver. This is a copy of the waiver that actually Wen Ho Lee signed, dated April 19, 1995:  
   Warning: To protect the LAN system from unauthorized use and to ensure that the systems are functioning properly, activities on these systems are monitored and recorded and subject to audit. Use of these systems is expressed consent to such monitoring and recording. Any unauthorized access or use of this LAN is prohibited and could be subject to criminal and civil penalties.  
   Here is the part Wen Ho Lee signed:  
   I understand and agree to follow these rules in my use of the ENCHANTED LAN. I assume full responsibility for the security of my workstation. I understand that violations may be reported to my supervisor or FSS-14, that I may be denied access to the LAN, and that I may receive a security infraction for a violation of these rules.  
   Now, the issue here is that the FBI claimed that the Department of Energy told him there was no waiver; no such waiver existed. The FBI wrongly assumed, then, that they needed a warrant to search. What is the result of this inept communication? Well, Lee's computer could have been searched, but instead was not searched for some three years. When the computer was finally searched, they discovered evidence that Wen Ho Lee had downloaded legacy codes to an unclassified computer. 
   The fundamental problem is that nobody was looking at the big picture. Surely, protecting nuclear secrets and national security outweighs the feeble attempts that were made to get a possible 
   conviction. 
   What we have here is, one, the Department of Energy did not know that Wen Ho Lee had signed a waiver. They could not find it in his personnel file because the file had been mislaid. Had they known that, as I indicated earlier, they could have monitored his computer. Instead, the FBI said, no, they were doing an investigation, and since they didn't have a waiver, his computer was not monitored by the Department of Energy. Yet, they found later that the waiver existed, as evidenced by the poster I just showed in evidence. 
   The FBI and the Department of Justice next bungled the counterintelligence warrant or the FISA, as evidenced by chart 2. The FBI, not once or twice, but three times requested warrants from the DOE. This is chart 2. This is the FISA report. Department of Energy, FBI, Department of Justice, and the FISA warrant, approved or rejected. Notra Trulock briefs the FBI. An FBI request was made by John Lewis, then assistant director of the FBI National Security Division. An FBI request was made to Gerald Schroeder, Acting Director, Office of Intelligence Policy and Review. It was rejected. Here is the rejection. Here is the sequence of events. The first time we had the sequence of the DOE, FBI, and Department of Justice proceeding to authorize the FISA warrant to investigate the alleged counterintelligence and espionage charges alleged against Wen Ho Lee. 
   The second time, Notra Trulock and others continued to prod FBI's investigation of Wen Ho Lee. FBI request made to John Lewis, then Assistant Director of the FBI National Security Division. FBI request made to Gerald Schroeder. Again, it was rejected. The second time it was rejected by the Department of Justice. 
   Now, then the last time, Mr. Lewis, who is up there in the hierarchy, Assistant Director of the FBI, National Security Division, feels so frustrated that he makes a personal plea to Attorney General Janet Reno. Again, Notra Trulock and others continue to prod the FBI. John Lewis makes a personal request to the Attorney General because he feels so strongly that there is justification to authorize this investigation. But the personal appeal falls on deaf ears. 
   Why was it rejected? What happened? We don't know. Nothing happened. But we do know that the Attorney General ignored two pleas for help. Notra Trulock, then DOE Director of Intelligence, personally briefed Janet Reno in ``great detail'' about the Lee case in August of 1997. John Lewis, FBI Director of Intelligence, also indicated he personally pled to Janet Reno to approve the FBI's request for a warrant to search Lee in August of 1997. 
   Why did Attorney General Janet Reno ignore pleas from two top national security advisers? We don't know. We don't know because there is a great reluctance to provide the committees of jurisdiction with that information. 
   I am personally disappointed in the FBI and the Department of Justice's refusal to testify publicly. Probably 90 percent of what has been found in closed sessions is not really classified, in my opinion. 
   What we are looking for here is accountability. We in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee intend to continue to identify those persons whose inaction has led to one of the most potentially catastrophic losses in our national security history. Now we have a situation where they seem to want to hide behind the smokescreen of ``national security'' or to finger-point and say it is not our responsibility. That is simply an unconscionable set of circumstances. 
   Finally, as we address a couple of other points that may come up in the debate which I think deserve consideration, why create one semiautonomous agency within the Department of Energy? We are creating a hybrid that has no other identifiable comparison. Let me put that myth to rest. There are other semiautonomous agencies that function extremely well. That is what we are proposing with the amendment which has been laid down. 
   Let's look at three of those semiautonomous agencies. 
   DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, is a separate agency within the Department of Defense under a director appointed by the Secretary of Defense. It works.  
   NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, is the largest bureau within the Department of Commerce. It is a semiautonomous agency. It works. 
   NSA, the National Security Agency, was established by Presidential directive as a separate department organized as an agency within the Department of Defense. It was structured in that manner and form because it was necessary that there be accountability and responsibility within the National Security Agency. It is a semiautonomous agency. 
   I encourage my colleagues as we proceed to vote tomorrow--my understanding is that we are going to have one hour of debate equally divided on the cloture motion on the amendment--to recognize that the time to address this is now, that the responsibility clearly is within this body, and that the amendment we offered identifies the one thing that was lacking as we look at how this set of security breaches could have occurred, and that is, it addresses accountability and responsibility. 
   For those who feel uncomfortable, I encourage them to recognize that they have a responsibility of coming up with something that will work. We think that the amendment pending, the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski-Kerrey amendment--I understand that Senators THOMPSON, SPECTER, GREGG, HUTCHINSON, SHELBY, WARNER, BUNNING, HELMS, FITZGERALD, LOTT, KERRY, FEINSTEIN, and BOB SMITH are a few of the other Members of the Senate who are cosponsoring this amendment. 
   It is a responsible amendment. Let's get on with the job. Let's put this issue in the restructured form that provides for accountability and responsibility, and move on. The American people and the taxpayers certainly deserve prompt action by this body. We have that obligation. The time is on the vote tomorrow. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. 
   I see no other Senator wishing time. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to join my colleagues in the important debate on ensuring the health care rights of patients across America. 
   Our nation has the best health care in the world, yet there is a growing concern over changes in how most Americans receive health care. Individuals once accustomed to choosing a doctor and paying for medical treatment are now thrown into managed care systems or HMOs. Too often for the patient, HMO rules, restrictions and concern for profit seem of more consequence than providing quality health care. 
   The Republican plan, called Patients' Bill of Rights Plus, is a direct response to patient concerns. In a nutshell, the Republican bill guarantees affordable, quality health care and provides access to the best doctors and specialists available. 
   The Republican bill will protect the unprotected by establishing a Bill of Rights for patients whose plans are not already regulated by existing consumer protection laws. Under our bill, patients will have the right to talk openly and freely with their doctor about all treatment options; the right to coverage for emergency care; and the right to see the doctor of their choice. 
   It will make health insurance more affordable and accessible by accelerating full tax deductibility of health premiums for the self employed; and expanding the Medical Savings Account pilot program to all of America. 
   It will empower patients by providing a timely and inexpensive appeals procedure for all patients who are denied coverage by an HMO. 
   Why is the Republican plan a better alternative? 
   The Democrat bill, called ``The Patients Bill of Rights Act,'' may have a similar title to the Republican bill, but the two bills represent entirely different approaches to the role of government in health care: 
   The Democrat bill encourages litigation. 
   Our plan insures patients will get the care they need, not a trial lawyer knocking at their door. It creates a fair and efficient process to resolve disputes with HMOs. 
   The Democrat plan, will enhance lawsuits, not the delivery of health care. Mr. President, health care cannot be improved through the court system. 
   The Democrat plan creates massive Federal bureaucracy. The Democrat plan regulates all health insurance at the federal level--thereby pre-empting state laws. The Democrat plan is a litany of federal mandates on private health insurance. It's one step closer to a federal take-over of America's health care system. 
   The Democrat plan is a ``one-size-fits-all plan.'' The Democrat bill squeezes patients into a one-size-fits-all health plan. The Democrat plan puts one of the most ineffective agencies, the Health Care Financing Administration, in charge of it all! 
   Maybe that works in Massachusetts, but it won't work in my State of Alaska. Let me explain. 
   The Federal Intrusion in Alaska doesn't work. Mr. President, a one-size-fits-all'' approach doesn't fit Alaska's health care needs. Let me tell you the facts: 
   Alaska contains the most rural, remote areas in the nation; 
   Alaska is 74 percent medically underserved; and most importantly; 
   Alaska is a state in which the Federal Government, and in particular, the Health Care Financing Administration, just doesn't understand. 
   Let me tell you about three health care problems in Alaska that were exacerbated by Federal intrusion: 
   Federal intervention threatens to destroy Alaska's Rural Physician Residency Program. Alaska's rural health care problems are tough. Physician turn-over rate is high. At Bethel Hospital, 4 of the 16 primary care physicians on staff leave every year. Many villages populated by 25-1,000 individuals never even have access to physicians.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Snowe Amendment--an amendment to rid the tragic practice of drive-through'' mastectomies. 
   Mr. President, one out of nine American women will suffer the tragedy of breast cancer. It is today the leading cause of death for women between the ages of 35 to 54. 
   Alaskan women are particularly vulnerable to this disease. We have the second highest rate of breast cancer in the nation. 
   1 in 7 Alaska women will get breast cancer and tragically it is the Number One cause of death among Native Alaskan women. 
   We know that these deaths are preventable--and the key to prevention is early detection. It is estimated that breast cancer deaths can be reduced by 30 percent if all women avail themselves of regular clinical breast examination and mammography. I'm proud of the work that this body has done in the recent past to expand Medicare and Medicaid coverage for mammographies. 
   I am also proud of the efforts that my wife Nancy has done in expanding early detection efforts throughout Alaska. You see, Mr. President, for many Alaska women, especially native women living in one of our 230 remote villages, regular screening and early detection are often hopeless dreams. 
   For 25 years, my wife Nancy has recognized this problem and did something about it. In 1974, she and a group of Fairbanks' women created the Breast Cancer Detection Center, for the purpose of offering mammographies to women in remote areas of Alaska--regardless of a woman's ability to pay. 
   Now, the Center uses a small portable mammography unit which can be flown to remote areas of Alaska, offering women in the most rural of areas easy access to mammographies at no cost. 
   Additionally, the Center uses a 43-foot long, 14 foot high and 26,000 pound mobile mammography van to travel through rural areas of Alaska. The van makes regular trips, usually by river barge, to remote areas in Interior Alaska such as Tanana. 
   Julie Roberts, a 42-year-old woman of Tanana, who receives regular mammographies from the mobile mammography van, knows the importance of early screening: 
   There's a lot of cancer here (in Tanana)--a lot of cancer. That's why it's important to have the mobile van here...... I know that if I get checked, I can catch it early and can probably save my life. I have three children and I want to see my grandchildren. 
   I am proud to say that the Fairbanks Center now serves about 2,200 women a year and has provided screenings to more than 25,000 Alaska women in 81 villages throughout the states. To help fund the efforts of the Fairbanks Center, each year Nancy and I sponsor a fishing tournament to raise money for the operation of the van and mobile mammography unit. After just three years, donations from the tournament have totalled over $1 million. 
   Mr. President, Nancy and I are committed to raising more funds for this important program so that every women in Alaska can benefit from the advances of modern technology and reduce their risk of facing this killer disease. 
   But, Mr. President, the fight against breast cancer does not end with detection of the disease. That is why I stand in strong support of Senator SNOWE's amendment. Her amendment will once and for all put an end to the practices of so-called drive-through'' mastectomies. 
   In too many cases women who survive the trauma of a mastectomy are being forced to get out of the hospital only hours after their surgery. How can medical care professionals allow this? Simply because many insurance companies demand that the procedure of a mastectomy be considered an out-patient service.'' 
   Here's the horror that many insurance companies cause: 
   Nancy Couchot, a 60 year old woman had a radical mastectomy at 11:30 a.m. She was released from the hospital five hours --even though she was not able to walk or use the rest room without assistance. 
   Victoria Berck, had a mastectomy and lymph node removal at 7:30 a.m. Seven hours later, she was given instructions on how to empty two drains attached to her body and sent home. Ms. Berck concludes, No civilized country in the world has a mastectomy as an out-patient service.'' 
   Mr. President, it's for these very reasons that I am in strong support of Senator SNOWE's amendment. Specifically, the amendment will require health insurance companies to allow physicians to determine the length of a mastectomy patient's hospital stay according to medical necessity. In other words, the bill makes it illegal to punish a doctor for following good medical judgment and sound medical treatment. 
   This amendment is important follow-up to legislation that I and many in this Body worked on worked on to ensure that mastectomy patients have access to reconstructive surgery. Prior to our efforts in last year's Omnibus bill, scores of women were denied reconstructive surgery following mastectomies because insurers have deemed the procedure to be cosmetic'' and, therefore, not medically necessary. 
   Mr. President, far too often breast cancer victims, who believe that they have adequate health care coverage, are horrified when they learn basic and sound medical practices are not covered in their health plan. 
   Mr. President, these issues are not partisan issues. We may have our differences regarding managing and financing health reform, but I think we all endorse accessible and affordable health care that preserves patient choice and physician discretion. Cancer does not look to see the politics of its victims.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today Marcia Kozie, who heads up my State office in Fairbanks, will retire from Federal service. She has served in this capacity since 1981. 
   When I think of my Fairbanks office, I think of an advisor and friend, Marcia Kozie. She knows everyone in town and stays current on all the issues involving Federal, State and local governments. If I want to know the whole story, I call Marcia. I know the old addage goes, ``no one is irreplaceable,'' but Marcia's boots will be difficult to fill. She has trailblazed for me these many years and her calm demeanor and soothing voice can smooth out the many wrinkles we often encounter. 
   When you cross the threshold of the Fairbanks office, you are always welcomed by a cheerful smile, a kind word and a sympathetic ear. Marcia Kozie has always had these winning ways, even during the most difficult of times. We all sometimes shoot the messenger by mistake, but Marcia's demeanor has always worked like a charm. Her ability to see the glass half full instead of empty, her cool head in times of crises and her genuine concern for my constituency have been worth more to me and Nancy and my office than a ton of Alaska gold. You just can't buy this kind of service. 
   Even though Marcia made her way to Alaska via Vermont, New Hampshire, Colorado, and Texas, she lived in the Fairbanks community for over 19 years before she came to work for me. In typical Marcia fashion, she immersed herself in the community getting involved with her three children and their activities, her husband Walt's business and many philanthropic groups who provided a special insight into Fairbanks community affairs. 
   She told me in her first interview that even though she had not worked for many years, she was adaptable and proficient in whatever the task. She continued by saying this was a God-given talent and that she didn't think He had taken it away from her, yet. And I have never regretted that decision to hire Marcia. While her Federal service will end, I know she will be devoting her time to spreading those God-given talents around the community. 
   She will be missed by all the staff members in both the Washington, DC, and State offices. It is with deep appreciation and gratitude that I thank her for 18 years of a job well done. As a matter of fact, the mayor of Fairbanks has proclaimed today, June 30, 1999, as Marcia Kozie Day in Fairbanks. 
   Toodle-loo, my loyal friend. Thank you for your service to this country, the State of Alaska and the people of Fairbanks.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send to the desk the Military Lands Withdrawal Act of 1999. I am introducing this legislation on behalf of the Administration. At this point I am neither prepared to support nor object to any of the specific provisions contained within this legislative proposal. It is my intention however, to hold hearings on this important legislation and the withdrawal renewals contained within it. After those hearings have been held and we have had the benefit of input from the parties most effected by the withdrawals, I am prepared to offer an amendment in the nature of a substitute which makes such needed changes as are identified during the hearing process. 
   This legislation renews the withdrawals contained within P.L. 99-606, enacted by Congress in 1986. This Congressional action withdrew 7.2 million acres of public land for use by the Department of Defense at six installations. The affected bases are the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range in Arizona, Nellis Air Force Base and Naval Air Station Fallon in Nevada, the McGregor Army Range in New Mexico, and Fort Wainwright and Fort Greely in my home state of Alaska. These withdrawals were for a period of 15 years and expire in 2001. 
   I have a deep abiding recognition of the unique and critical role all of these military bases play in our national defense strategy and on the economies of the states within which they are located. However, I also understand that the issues surrounding the renewal of these withdrawals are complex and varied. Congress's ability to resolve these issues will ultimately define success or failure for this entire round of withdrawals. What we do here will have a lasting impact on these bases military mission, their local economies, and the environmental protection of the public lands. It is my firm belief that only through the Congressional hearing process can the concerns of all affected parties be recorded and factored into the renewal of these base withdrawals. 
   I am committed to the prompt consideration of this legislation. However, taking into consideration the fact that these withdrawals do not expire until 2001, I believe it is prudent that we move this legislation at a pace which allows both the public and our colleagues the opportunity to participate in a meaningful way and in the proper forum.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on July 6, 1924, the first non-stop flight between Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska occurred. The flight was made in an old water-cooled Hissopowered Standard J-1 open-cock-pit biplane and was flown by Noel Wien and Bill Yunker. 
   The Wein name is synonymous with Alaska aviation. It is said that Noel Wien's flight between Anchorage and Fairbanks was the start of Wein Air Alaska. I will quote for the RECORD an account of the early days as told by Noel Wein.  
   The change has been great both in aviation and the city of Fairbanks since that memorable day, July 6, 1924, when, sitting behind an old water-cooled Hisso powered Standard J-1 open-cockpit biplane, Bill Yunker and I landed here after flying non-stop from Anchorage. 
   We had flown up at night, thus taking advantage of the smoother air. The smoke was very thick for the last 80 miles and kept us guessing all the time. It was even difficult to follow the railroad tracks from Nenana on in. 
   There was intrigue about the stillness of the air and the frontier atmosphere of Fairbanks, which made me like the north from that first day. 
   For two weeks we couldn't find our way cross-country due to the forest fire smoke, but when it cleared up we were busy. People her took to the air quickly. They were of the hardy type, willing to take a gamble. Ben Eielson had made a number of flights that spring, before I arrived. He had also started a company the year before, in the summer of 1923, and had brought in an old reliable OX-5 Curtis Jenny JN-4D open cockpit World War I training plane. 
   Due to the interest created by Eielson's earlier pioneering, we had little trouble getting flying business to the outlying mining camps. Livengood, located 60 miles northwest of here, was one of the best of the gold producing camps. The first season in 1924, we made 34 flights to Livengood, and in the summer of 1925, 43 flights. 
   All went smoothly until mid-summer of 1925. We had purchased a supposedly major overhauled plane from Lincoln, Nebraska, one of the Hisso Standard build-up headquarters. The engine worked fine on the flight over to Livengood, but on the return trip something happened. All of a sudden the water from the cooling system of the engine gave us a shower bath. I knew that because of the loss of water the engine would get so hot it would stop running. We were about half-way back to Fairbanks, near Wickersham Dome. I spotted a shelf to one side of the dome which seemed like the only possible chance to get down without breaking up or going over on our back. We were cruising lower than the 2,500 foot shelf, so we had to use power to get up to it. The old engine was steaming plenty when we got to a landing approach. It turned out to be a fair landing place and we stayed right side up and landed without breaking anything. It turned out that the water pump had broken in flight, which in turn had thrown the water out. 
   The two passengers and myself walked in to Olnes, on the Chatanika River, over the tussuk covered trail. One passenger, an old Sourdough, had no trouble walking out. The other passenger, an insurance adjuster, had flown over on both business and pleasure. This passenger, I would say, was my first tourist, and possibly the first flying tourist passenger in Alaska. He had on oxford shoes and was about to give up before we arrived at the Chatanika River. 
   It is not my intent in these articles to be writing of my experiences, but instead to give some idea of the progress made in aviation and the change of times in the north. 
   Having had to discontinue flying in the fall of 1924 because of the open cockpit of the old Hisso Standard, a decision was made to try to get a cabin plane with an air cooled motor for use in wintertime. Because I was going ``outside'' for the winter to visit my folks in Minnesota, it worked out well for me to make a tour of the states to see what was being built. I found that about all that was being built was a very small number of open cockpit planes with old XO-5 and Hisso motors. One exception was the Huff Deland company which was building planes with an open front seat for two passengers and a pilot seat in the rear. This plane had an early model Wright air cooled engine of about 200 horsepower, but we had decided not to settle for anything but a cabin plane. 
   Both the Wright company and the Curtiss company did their best to locate the type of plane we wanted, but their efforts were unsuccessful. We finally had to settle on a Dutch built Fokker F-111 or F-3, a six-place monoplane which K.L.M. and early German airlines had already been using on some kind of schedule service in Europe. This plane had been built in 1921 and it was already the spring of 1925. There still were no cabin planes being built in the United States. 
   The Atlantic Aircraft Company, a dealer for Fokker, had three ships available. We bought one of them that had been used some, for $9,500. We shipped it all the way to Fairbanks via the Panama Canal. It had a German 6 cylinder engine of 235 horsepower. The cabin was very plush with curtains and all the trimmings. This ship proved conclusively that a cabin airplane was the type to use in Alaska even though we could not use it through the winter of 1925-26 because it had no brakes except for a tail skid which helped to stop it. It had a rather streamlined monoplane wing and took a minimum of 1,000 feet  to stop after the three points were firmly on the ground. We had some close shaves on sand bars and fields 1,000 or under, during the summers of 1925-26. Our flying out of Fairbanks was the only cross-country flying in the Territory at that time. There was one other airline at Ketchikan where Roy Jones was doing some flying with an old two-place navy training flying boat. We were successful with the flying of the Fokker F-111 and made the first commercial flight to Nome, carrying 4 passengers and 500 pounds of baggage, a 1,200 pound load. We flew non-stop back here in 6 hours and 55 minutes. That's all for now. Noel.--Originally published in the ``Wien Alaska Arctic Liner'' August 1956.  
   On July 6, 1999, the 75th anniversary of the first non-stop flight, the sons of Noel Wien, Richard and Merrill, will pay homage to their late father's legacy. In commemoration, they will retrace the journey in a refurbished Boeing Stearman biplane, which was built in 1943. This type of plane was used to train pilots in World War II. They will leave from the Delaney Park Strip in Anchorage, which is now a public park, and land at Fairbanks International Airport. The original landing site in Fairbanks, Weeks Field, has since been developed and houses the Noel Wien Public Library. 
   After all his years of flying, Richard gained a whole new respect for his father's flying ability when he and his son, Michael, flew the refurbished biplane from Seattle. They made the trip in early May and encountered winter conditions during the flight. It did not take long to realize that they weren't within the confines of a closed, heated cabin. 
   Both Richard and Merrill continued in their father's footsteps. They are both commercially rated pilots with thousands of flying hours between them. They were both involved with Wien Air Alaska and then when the family sold it, the brothers opened up a helicopter business. Although Richard and Merrill are no longer involved in the commercial side of aviation, it's in the blood. 
   Organizing this event was a labor of love for Richard Wien. He also credits his major sponsor the Alaska Airmen's Association for helping to make it happen in addition to other individuals and organizations. He is embarking on this trip to honor his father and also the 75th anniversary of the first airmail run made by Ben Eielson. 
   My heartiest congratulations to Richard and Merrill Wien for organizing this wonderful tribute to their father and also for keeping the pioneering aviation spirit alive through this commemorative flight.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am joined today by Senator JOHN BREAUX in introducing The Nuclear Decommissioning Funds Clarification Act. This change in the tax law is necessary because the electricity industry is rapidly moving from a regulatory monopoly model to the competitive marketplace. 
   In 1984, Congress enacted Code Section 468A which was designed to allow state public service commissions to authorize that future costs for decommissioning nuclear power plants could be charged by a utility to its customers to be dedicated to a nuclear decommissioning fund. Currently, utilities are permitted a deduction for contributions to their decommissioning funds. The amount that can be deducted is currently limited to the cost of service amount or the ruling amount. The cost of service amount is the amount of decommissioning costs included in the taxpayer's cost of service for ratemaking purposes. The ruling amount is the amount that the IRS determines to be necessary to provide for level funding of an amount equal to the taxpayer's nuclear decommissioning costs. 
   Since Section 468A was adopted, the electricity industry landscape has been substantially transformed. Since 1992, more than 20 states have approved plans to introduce competition and all states are considering deregulation. The Energy Committee which I chair has also held several hearings on Federal deregulation proposals and it is my hope that a federal deregulation bill will be adopted in this Congress. 
   Since deductible contributions made to a nuclear decommissioning fund are based on limitations reflected in cost-of-service ratemaking, companies operating in a competitive market can no longer deduct contributions to decommissioning funds. Our bill clarifies the deductibility of nuclear decommissioning costs in a market environment and codifies the definition of nuclear decommissioning costs that limit contributions. 
   This legislation also clarifies a number of tax issues relating to decommissioning funds to ensure that nuclear utilities can operate effectively in this new competitive environment.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to create a new regional office for the Environmental Protection Agency to be based in Alaska. I have been concerned for some time about the relationship between the federal government and my constituents. Alaska has always provided unique challenges for federal regulators. Its weather, remoteness, and the special problems caused by them have often resulted in a disconnect between federal regulators and my state. Currently, Alaska is part of Region 10 of the EPA based in Seattle. While it rains a lot in Seattle, the environment of Washington state is much more similar to Oregon and Idaho than Alaska. Alaska comprises 17% of America's total size and faces climactic extremes unheard of in the lower 48.  
   For example, many people have heard that the unique geography of Los Angeles creates extreme atmospheric inversion conditions that contributes to its air pollution. However, I have been told that my home town of Fairbanks actually has a greater inversion problem than not only Los Angeles, but also anywhere else in the world except for the South Pole. 
   I also believe that the cost issue is an important one since creation of a regional office would lower the tremendous travel and temporary duty costs faced by lower 48 based EPA staff who must fly back and forth to Alaska. Basing them in Alaska should significantly reduce these travel costs. 
   I recognize that some may feel that the creation of a new regional office in Alaska is unwise. I would point out that I do not believe that the Seattle office has regularly handled Alaska issues poorly, but I do believe that these issues could be handled better if there was a regional office located in Alaska. Alaska faces wetland challenges like no other state. Our nation has seen a tremendous loss in wetlands in states such as California that has lost over 80% of its original wetlands. In comparison, Alaska has lost less than half of one percent of our nation's wetlands due to development even though we are a large producer of our nation's natural resources. Alaska is a state where wetlands banking is not an appropriate solution to address the loss of wetlands in California. Alaska's wetlands are also very different than those found in California or anywhere else in our nation. Much of Alaska's wetlands are frozen for all but a few months of the year. 
   Even the Clean Air Act has a different application in Alaska. Low sulfur diesel in the lower 48 for on-road usage is not appropriate for my state where the percentage of diesel used for on-road uses is minuscule compared to that of the off-road uses. This situation is reversed in every other state. Fortunately, the EPA has seen fit to waive the low sulfur diesel requirement until a new lower national standard for both off and on-road diesel is in place during the next decade. However, we need to ensure that all federal regulations put into place reflect the realities of every state in our nation. Creation of a new Alaska based regional office of the EPA would be a firm step forward towards this goal. 
   In conclusion, Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill in order to make the EPA more efficient and responsive to some unique environmental challenges in my state.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on June 17, I introduced bipartisan legislation (1240) providing capital gains for the forest products industry and lifting the existing cap on the reforestation tax credit and amortization provisions of the tax Code. 
   Unfortunately, because of a clerical error, the section of the bill that lifted the cap on the tax credit and the amortization provisions of the Code was inadvertently omitted from the bill. Today I am reintroducing the bill as it was originally intended to be drafted.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to the steel quota bill, H.R. 975. Simply put, steel quotas are wrong. The protectionist measures proposed in this legislation represent a failed trade policy that the United States abandoned long ago. For the last 50 years, the United States has been the world's leading advocate of open markets. At the same time, we have grown to be the strongest and most productive economy on earth. Now is not the time for this government to reverse an economic policy that has served it so well. 
   Steel quotas are wrong for the world's economy, and by definition America's economy. In this era of global business, open markets are essential to international prosperity. In the midst of the Asian economic crisis, American leadership in keeping markets open has prevented a global financial meltdown. The U.S. and its allies have spent years developing an international trading system. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin was not exaggerating last week when he warned that the steel quota bill could set off a wave of market access restrictions that would undermine this system and threaten the world's financial health. 
   Steel quotas are also wrong for the American economy. There is no question that open markets present some difficult challenges for American companies. They lead to stiffer competition and force greater efficiency. But open markets also mean greater opportunities. As a nation, we are succeeding. The United States is the strongest and most prosperous nation on earth. We have the most skilled workforce, the most productive factories and the most innovative thinkers anywhere in the world. Our commitment to open markets has played a key role in this success. 
   In my home state of Alaska, for example, international trade is a vital part of the economy. Last year, Alaskan companies exported more than 750 million dollars worth of merchandise to foreign countries. And that was an off year in my state because of the Asian flue--in most years, our merchandise exports total nearly 1 billion dollars. 
   For many reasons, the quota bill will do more harm to the American economy than good. First, the steel quota bill will provoke foreign countries to retaliate against our exports. And the United States will be in no position to complain. The international trading system--the one that we played a leading role in creating--authorizes countries to retaliate against those who erect trade barriers such as quotas. This retaliation will be devastating to our farmers and factory workers. It will cost many more American jobs than it will save. As American companies lose sales abroad, they will be forced to cut jobs and close doors at home. 
   Second, the quota bill will deny American manufacturers the steel they need to make their products. Domestic steel companies are only able to meet about 75 percent of the demand for steel in this country. As a result, steel quotas could create dangerous steel shortages--shortages that hurt the oil industry in Alaska. In addition, the quota bill is completely insensitive to the types of steel that American companies need. There are many special types of steel that simply are not made in the U.S. Quotas could completely deny American companies access to those special types of steel, forcing them to reduce the quality of their products or move their production overseas. 
   Finally, by making a critical raw material more expensive, steel quotas will put many of our products at a world market disadvantage. Because American manufacturers will be forced to pay more for steel than their foreign competitors, their products will be more expensive. Again, the steel quota bill will result in lost sales abroad and lost jobs at home. 
   For all of these reasons, we must not pass the steel quota bill. It is wrong for the United States and wrong for the world's economy. As Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan recently warned, it will indeed be a great tragedy if we pass this legislation.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, if I may interrupt for a moment on a matter of procedure, I recognize the difficulty the leader has in trying to orchestrate things in the body. I know he is working very diligently to try to come up with time agreements and the possibility of stacking votes and holding them over until Monday. I remember that former Senator Jake Garn sort of had an affinity for a family-friendly process, and I want to commend the leadership for trying to follow that. 
   I want to point out that I happen, by coincidence, to live very far away. For me to make a Monday vote, I have to leave Sunday night and fly all night to get here. If I leave on the very first flight from Fairbanks, AK, on Monday and leave at 8 o'clock, I get arrive in Washington in the evening. Ordinarily, I don't go back to my State on a weekend; I stay here. But Father's Day and Mother's Day are fairly important, so I intend to go to Alaska today. 
   Unfortunately, I will miss the stacked votes that are proposed on Monday. I was inclined to object to the unanimous-consent agreement, but in  the spirit of cordiality, which I have pretty much maintained around here in the last 19 years, I will defer to the leadership. I wanted to explain this uniqueness to those who live in Chicago or for those who can take the train next door. I wish I could. It is a little different set of circumstances. 
   I have made my concerns known. As we plan events, I think we should recognize there are a couple of special days, and Father's Day is one of them. I have 11 grandchildren who are coming, so sayonara.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. My only frustration, I share with the leader, is that the assumption today was that we were going to have some votes. As a consequence, I made my plans accordingly for a 2 o'clock airplane. I could have gotten a 10:30 airplane. After 2 o'clock, there are no more airplanes. I share the frustration of the leader who, obviously, is today accommodating a number of Senators who want to get out of here early, even though the leader said today we are going to vote in the morning at least. We did vote in the morning. It works both ways, Mr. President. When the leader says so, the consistency of that statement, I think, should be followed through, if I can make an appropriate suggestion.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, less than 3 months ago this body adopted my amendment allowing commercial fishing and subsistence gathering, which consists primarily of gathering sea gull eggs in Glacier Bay. That issue came before this body, and passed 59 to 40. 
   It went to conference, along with the issue of the steel and oil and gas guarantees that are under discussion before this body. 
   I am here on behalf of the little people. I can't stand here and compete on the broad issues of steel dumping or the impact the decline of the price of oil has had on our stripper wells; or the economies of those areas dependent on steel, West Virginia and New Mexico; or oil and gas, as in Oklahoma. I stand here on behalf of a few of the native people of my State, the Huna Tlingit Indians, who have lived for centuries with access to an area known as Glacier Bay, which is one of our premier national parks. 
   Clearly, this issue is not in proportion with the importance of steel dumping, or the decline in the price of oil. I come before this body representing this small group of indigenous American Alaskan Indians who have been dependent on a subsistence lifestyle for thousands of years. 
   Glacier Bay is a large area in the northern end of the archipelago of southeastern Alaska. It is a magnificent area. Visitors in the summertime arrive on cruise ships. It is a great way for a visitor to enjoy this magnificent, scenic site. However, it is a very short season, roughly Memorial Day to Labor Day. 
   The rest of the time, the area has been utilized by very small, individual fishing vessels that are bound by the resource management of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. 
   In conference, there was a concern expressed by various House Members as to whether the fisheries resource in  Glacier Bay could be maintained and the impact commercial fishing would have on that resource. As a consequence, I have changed my amendment. My previous amendment simply allowed commercial fishing and subsistence gathering to remain in Glacier Bay until the court determined whether the State had the right to manage these waters within the State of Alaska. 
   I have now changed the amendment to propose a moratorium for 18 months. During that time, there would be a joint study between the State Department of Fish and Game and the Park Service to study the impact of this small amount of commercial fishing and subsistence gathering on Glacier Bay, and to make a determination whether there was any detrimental effect. If there was, obviously, it would cease. 
   It is interesting to note that the matter before the Senate is associated with a matter of substantial cost, because we are talking about dumping steel, we are talking about addressing relief, we are talking about oil and gas, we are talking about some type of relief for the stripper wells. It is my understanding that steel, oil, and gas amendments might amount to as much as $300 million. 
   I point out to my colleagues, there is zero cost associated with my amendment--no cost whatever. There is justice to residents of these communities of Alaska. 
   Let me describe the communities. Gustavus has 346 residents and is adjacent to Glacier Bay; 55 of those residents are actively engaged in fishing. Elfin Cove, outside the bay, has 54 people; 47 are engaged in fishing. Huna, which is a Tlingit Indian village directly across from Glacier Bay, has 900 people; 228 are in the fisheries. Pelican City has 187 residents; there are 86 in the fisheries. 
   These communities have no alternative. They can't go anyplace else. What is the justification for the attitude of the Park Service? There has not been one public hearing held--not one. They did not advertise for witnesses to determine the impact. They simply made an administrative decision and said we are closing it. 
   Let me show another chart demonstrating where commercial fishing is allowed by statutory law in National Parks: Assateague, in Virginia; Biscayne, in Florida; Buck Reef, in the Virgin Islands; Canaveral National Seashore, in Florida; Cape Hatteras, in North Carolina; Cape Krusenstern, in Alaska; Channel Islands, CA; Fire Island, NY; Gulf Islands, MS; Isle Royale, in Michigan; Jean Lafitte National Park, LA, to name several. But they have made a decision to close the fishing in my State of Alaska. 
   It is interesting, further, to note some of the other activities they allow in the park, because it reflects the attitude of the Park Service and the manner in which they initiate an action. 
   The Park Service saw fit some 3 months ago to initiate what was basically a raid on commercial fishing in Glacier Bay. They used Park Service personnel, they boarded the boats that were fishing there, they had sidearms, and they simply said they were going to close this area. The area was not, in fact, closed. Those fishermen had a right to be there at that time. That was a pretty heavy tactic to use, but they saw fit to use it. 
   Our Governor indicated his wish, as did our State and our legislature, that commercial fishing be allowed to continue in Glacier Bay. 
   To add insult to injury, the people of Glacier Bay have been dependent on the gathering of sea gull eggs since time immemorial. One wonders why they would need sea gull eggs. 
   Frankly, it is very difficult to raise chickens in Alaska. There is a lot of rain. This is a typical village in Glacier Bay. This is an 1889 photo. That village is no longer there, but this is the kind of village they used to have. You see there, they are drying the fish and so forth. The Huna villages today are not like that by any means--but the point is these people still live in a subsistence lifestyle. 
   What I want to say here is just the other day the Park Service decided to prohibit, if you will, what it had ignored previously and that was the gathering of sea gull eggs for harvest in Glacier Bay. They apprehended a Huna native for gathering sea gull eggs. I do not know how long they kept the sea gull eggs, but a couple of days later they gave them back to the Huna Indian Association. What is the consistency of this? I do not know that there is any, and it points out the Park Service is aggressively hostile to something that other agencies have seen fit to recognize as unique to the character of the subsistence lifestyle of the native people of Alaska. 
   It should be remembered that Canada and the United States reached an agreement several years ago allowing native people to take birds and eggs during the spring. That agreement was recognized by an amendment to the Migratory Bird Treaty. It has been nearly 2 years since the Senate approved the amendment to the treaty. What this amendment did was recognize the need of the native people to take birds and eggs in the spring, because in the fall those birds are gone. The reason is very simple; cold weather has come and the birds have left. 
   The State Department has not yet exchanged the instrument of ratification with Canada. This is the final formal exchange of documents necessary to put the new treaty into effect. Canada is eager to complete the process because the new treaty language is needed to comply with changes in its Constitution. I'm told the delay is due to the bureaucratic failure of the Department of the Interior to implement new regulations. Some of the State Department officials think that is needed before final documents are exchanged. I, personally, see no reason for the delay. 
   The point I want to make is an obvious one. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has recognized the necessity of the native people of Alaska, being dependent on subsistence, to take birds and eggs in spring, including sea gull eggs. But the Park Service--another branch of the Federal Government--has chosen to enforce a prohibition against taking sea gull eggs. What is the justification for that? I do not know, unless it is a very aggressive Park Service. But, clearly, if the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service sees fit to allow a modest taking of eggs and migratory birds for subsistence purposes, you would think the U.S. Park Service would recognize and honor and appreciate the tradition of the Native Alaskans and allow this to take place. Still, that is not the case.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURKOWSKI. In my amendment I propose this joint study take place, and it is quite legitimate to ask, Where is the money going to come from? For some time now the Park Service has been generating revenue from cruise ship receipts from a recreation fee demonstration program. They have approximately $2.8 million, of which $435,000 is unencumbered at this time. It is my suggestion this be used for the Park Service's joint evaluation, along with the State of Alaska, to study the renewability of the fisheries resources in Glacier Bay. 
   Somebody might ask, Why should a Glacier Bay moratorium be attached to  this bill--an appropriations bill? I hope the appropriators recognize this is a legitimate appropriations amendment. It is setting parameters for the expenditure of funds being appropriated. Further, the moratorium is a time-honored and time-tested device. This moratorium simply amends last year's appropriation bill which terminated the fishing in Glacier Bay. If fisheries can be closed on an appropriations bill and the field of participants can be narrowed in an appropriations bill, then it is not out of place to use the same process for a follow-up measure, and that is what we have done. This is a legitimate appropriation amendment setting parameters for the expenditure of funds being appropriated. 
   This belongs in this package because it went over to the House and Senate conferees as part of the supplemental package, along with steel and oil. It was a part of those issues that were considered. 
   But as we look at the issue of equity here, there is no question this amendment is an amendment substantially different from the previous amendment inasmuch as it gives a moratorium of 18 months in which to evaluate, in a joint study, the renewability of the fisheries resource. As evidenced by the concern of the conferees in the House, Senator STEVENS and I--I was given the opportunity in that conference to make a personal presentation. But that was a different amendment. That was simply to allow fishing to continue until such time as the court determined who had jurisdiction. This amendment sets to rest the concerns relative to the renewability of that resource by authorizing this joint study. 
   It also recognizes, in a sense, there is no real trustworthy information on the impact of fishing or subsistence use in Glacier Bay on the ecosystem. Opponents have argued from time to time there may be some consequences, but they have offered no real proof. On the other side, it is impossible to prove the negative that fishing has no lasting impact. 
   Before fishermen are permanently removed or restricted, which will have irreversible consequences for the fishermen, the processing companies and the communities affected, I think it is appropriate to actually test the hypothesis that fishing is detrimental in some way. That is why we have altered our amendment to require this 18-month study. 
   My worst fear, as I have indicated, about the Park Service harassment of the Alaska Native people, was realized this last week when they seized several dozen sea gull eggs from a Native resident of Hoonah, one particular resident. This was unwarranted harassment by the Park Service. I think it represents an insensitive, arrogant attitude and is reminiscent of the Indian policies of the 1800s, where we were simply driving individuals off the land they had traditionally had access to. Only passage of my amendment will end this harassment. 
   Again, this is only a few hundred people, but they have no other appeal. They do not want to live off welfare. They have no other place to go. There is no reason why they should be excluded from fishing in this area, as we recognize the Park Service allows fishing in the 16 other national parks. I have had letters from local residents repeatedly assuring me that previously they had been under the assumption the Park Service had no intention to eliminate the traditional use, including fish and subsistence gathering. 
   Why do they enforce such an action in Glacier Bay and not enforce it in the 16 other areas where they allow it by statute? This fishery consists of a small number of small vessels. They do a little salmon, crab, halibut, bottom fishing. It is important to the people, as I have indicated, of Elfin Cove, 34 people, Hoonah, 228 people, who fish. 
   There have been provisions that Senator STEVENS has been able to prevail on, allowing Federal funding for fishermen as a consequence of them losing the right to fish. The letters I have ask me why the Park Service is mandating they can no longer fish. Why isn't the Government more sensitive to their particular needs? Why is the Government singling them out when they have no place else to go? These are hard questions to answer. 
   This is a situation of justice. These little people are crying out, and they are crying out in the only voice they have, and that is the voice of the Congress of the United States. 
   That is basically where we are. It is my understanding there may be an effort to table this legislation. I personally cannot understand why the amendment would not be accepted and sent over with the rest of the package. Again, I appeal to fairness and equity and recognize, unlike the steel issue and the oil issue, this has absolutely no cost. This is simply an 18-month study on the merits of the resource--that is simply all it is--so these people can continue their rightful pursuit of their traditional use of fish and game.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is pretty much the case. They say fishing is a commercial activity, but if you look at this tour boat entering into the bay with 1,200 passengers, that obviously is a pretty significant commercial activity. 
   There was a cruise vessel that had an accident in Glacier Bay the other day. It hit a rock. As far as I know, it is still on the rock. It leaked a little fuel--a few gallons. They are working on it. They are going to get it off. There is not going to be damage to the ecology or the environment. Nevertheless, that is a commercial activity.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I will make one more point--I am sure there are others who want to be heard--relative to an inconsistency. That is, again, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service allows migratory bird taking in Alaska in the spring, and they have seen fit to do that, recognizing the subsistence needs of those native people, and egg gathering as well. But the U.S. Park Service, just within the last 2 weeks, has indicated they will not allow sea gull egg gathering in the park. We have two different agencies  with two different jurisdictions, I grant you that. But it is definitely an inconsistency. 
   Again, for those who are wondering what this issue is doing in the middle of steel and oil, I simply appeal to the floor managers to recognize the action that was taken when it was sent over to the House. Unlike steel and unlike oil, which did not have a vote on this floor, this issue had a vote. We had a good vote. As a consequence of that, it belongs in the package that is going back. Some may argue the intricacies of procedure, but a deal is a deal, and I made a commitment to my colleagues that I would bring this up again, and I intend to bring it up again and again because there is an injustice here. 
   If we are able to prevail on a tabling motion, why, then we run the risk of what may happen to it in the House. I urge the floor managers to take this amendment. 
   It is my intention to ask for the yeas and nays. I do not know what the procedure is, but it may be that the leaders want to delay voting on this matter until such time as they determine it is appropriate. I appeal to my colleagues to take the amendment.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. 
   I am disappointed to learn that my senior colleague intends to table the amendment. On the other hand, I know that he very much supports the continued fishing and subsistence harvest in  Glacier Bay. Nevertheless, we are faced with a situation here where the issue is kind of caught, if you will, between two major issues; namely, the guarantee on steel and the guarantee on oil. The reason it belongs here is because we voted on it in the supplemental in which we also had the steel and oil matters. We voted on it and passed it 59 to 40, and it went over to the conference. It was the same conference that addressed the Glacier Bay issue that addressed steel loan guarantees and the oil guarantee, which, I might mention, cost $270 million. My amendment costs absolutely zero. 
   I hope my colleagues will accept the amendment. But they may see fit not to. As a consequence, I believe we have an injustice occurring in Alaska for those few hundred Alaska Indian people who depend, and have for years and years, on subsistence access in Glacier Bay. The bureaucrats within the Park Service moved in and simply said: We are going to close it, and that is it. 
   We have been able, through the efforts of Senator STEVENS, to get remuneration for the potential loss of their rights. But the fact is, on this chart we have 16 national parks where commercial fishing is allowed. 
   I encourage my colleagues to reflect on the vote that prevailed, 59 to 40, to allow fishing in Glacier Bay. But this is a different amendment. I changed my amendment. Previously, we were going to wait until there was a determination by the State to decide who had jurisdiction. That was going to go to the courts. My current amendment is simply an 18-month moratorium to allow the State to work with the Park Service to evaluate whether or not the resource is in danger. The funding for that is available within the funds for the Park Service.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, finally, I believe that as an authorizer I have been caught, if you will, in this continued dilemma of the appropriators. 
   I remind you that we have not had hearings on the issue of steel, nor hearings on the issue of oil, as far as this guarantee package is concerned. 
   It reminds me of an issue that occurred last year with respect to the appropriations process. The Clinton administration decided to acquire Headwaters in Northern California for $315 million and the New World Mine Site in Montana at a cost of $65 million. That is $380 million. It did not go through my committee of jurisdiction, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. These decisions last year were made with no congressional involvement. The administration sought to bypass the authorizing committee entirely and have the appropriators essentially just write the check for the purpose. We are seeing more and more of this. 
   As an authorizer, I think we have a job to do, and we are either going to do our job or we might as well give it to the appropriators. 
   As chairman of the authorizing committee, I want the opportunity for the committee to carefully review the merits of this acquisition. Instead, $380 million went right out. As a consequence, we are seeing similar things today with regard to the merits of the loan guarantee on oil and steel. 
   Ultimately, my arguments failed last year. The authorizations and funding were included in the 1998 Interior appropriations bill, much to the administration's delight. There were never any hearings. There was never any open debate for any type of public review. 
   My little deal represents a few hundred Native people in Alaska, appealing, if you will, for 18 months to study the impact of their modest fishing and subsistence gathering, and they are depending upon the Senate in this regard because they have no other place to turn. 
   Give them money if you want, but they don't want handouts. They are a proud people; they want the right to continue to do what they have done. 
   I encourage my colleagues to recognize what is happening here. I hope some day we go to a 2-year budget process. 
   I appreciate the consideration of all my colleagues.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I will make one clarifying statement relative to the vote that was taken and a reference made by my senior colleague to the germaneness of my amendment. 
   I would like the Record to note that the moratorium that I proposed simply amended last year's appropriations bill which terminated fishing in Glacier Bay. If the fisheries could be closed and the field of participants could be narrowed in an appropriation, then it was certainly not out of place to use the same process for the Glacier Bay amendment, which failed under the tabling motion. I think it was a legitimate appropriation amendment. It set parameters for the expenditure of funds to be appropriated. That is certainly a time-honored, time-tested device. 
   I recognize all my colleagues were interested in saving their own individual bills, those who are interested in steel, those who are interested in oil guarantees; and, obviously, I was interested in saving fishing in Glacier Bay for native people. 
   But, hopefully, there will be another day. I will continue to work to convince my colleagues of the merits of my position. I particularly want to thank and recognize the explanation offered by my senior colleague, Senator STEVENS, who had indicated to me sometime ago he would move to table any amendments on this pending matter. That was certainly addressed as well by Senator BYRD. I appreciate and respect their opinion. 
   We will still be fighting for the native people associated with fishing in Glacier Bay.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to offer bipartisan legislation that would help ensure that our Nation maintains its position as a world leader in the forest products industry. I am pleased to be joined by Senators BREAUX, GORTON, COCHRAN, TIM HUTCHINSON, COLLINS, LINCOLN, SHELBY, SNOWE, MURRAY, SESSIONS, GORDON SMITH, KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, ROD GRAMS, and MARY LANDRIEU. 
   This industry is vital to the United States' economy. It ranks in the top ten of the country's manufacturing industries, representing 7.8 of the manufacturing work force. It employs 1.5 million workers, with a payroll of $40.8 billion. I ask my colleagues to attempt to imagine a single minute of their day that does involve the utilization of a forest product--from the paper this speech is written on, to the desk and chair in my office, to the lumber in my house, to the box my computer arrives in. Clearly, the health of the world economy is dependent on a vibrant forest products industry. 
   At the same time, the industry is facing serious international competitive threats. New capacity growth is now taking place in other countries, where forestry, labor and environmental practices may not be as responsible as those in the U.S. Additionally, a recent study using the Joint Committee on Taxation's estimating model shows that the U.S. forest products industry has the second highest tax burdens in the world--55 percent. 
   The Reforestation Tax Act recognizes the unique nature of timber and the overwhelming risks that accompany investment in this essential natural asset, and attempts to place the industry on a more competitive footing with our competitors. In short, it would reduce the capital gains paid on timber for both individuals and corporations and expand the current reforestation credit. Because it often takes decades for a tree to grow to a marketable size, it is important that we look carefully at the long-term return on investment and the treatment of the costs associated with owning and planting of timber. 
   The first part of the Reforestation Tax Act would provide a sliding scale reduction in the amount of taxable gain based on the number of years the asset is held (3% per year). The maximum reduction allowed would be 50 percent. Thus, if the taxpayer held the timber for 17 years, the effective tax rate for corporate holdings would be 17.5% and the rate for most individuals would be 10%. 
   The second part of the bill would encourage replanting by lifting the existing cap on the reforestation tax credit and amortization provisions of the tax code. Currently, the first $10,000 of reforestation expenses are eligible for a 10 percent tax credit and can be amortized over 7 years. No additional expenses are eligible for either the credit or the deduction, meaning that most reforestation expenses are not recoverable until the timber is harvested. The legislation removes the $10,000 cap and allows all reforestation expenses to qualify for the tax credit and to be amortized over a 5-year period. This change in the law will provide a strong incentive for increased reforestation by eliminating the arbitrary cap on such expenses. 
   These tax changes will provide a strong incentive for landowners of all sizes to not only plant and grow trees, but also to reforest their land after harvest. This is key to maintaining a long-term sustainable supply of fiber and to keeping land in a forested state. 
   Besides ensuring fairness, the Reforestation Tax Act will encourage sound forestry practices that keep our environment healthy for the future. Timberlands held by corporations help reduce the demand for timber from public lands. Moreover, by sequestering carbon, managed forests help to offset emissions that contribute to the ``greenhouse effect.'' Unfortunately, the current high tax burden on forest assets runs counter to our nation's commitment to preserve and invest in the environment. This bill would encourage reforestation--or reinvestment in the environment--by extending tax credits for all reforestation expenses and shortening the amortization period for reforestation costs and by making investment in timber viable. As we consider policies to counteract global warming and improve water quality, we need to ensure that our tax policy is aligned with and encourages sound forestry practices.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today there are 204 days left before the Y2K problem becomes a concrete reality for any entity throughout the world that has a computer system. 
   The Y2K issue has been publicized across this nation; sometimes to a greater degree than necessary. Some Americans have even resorted to hoarding food and planning for the end of the world. While no one has a magic answer as to what will happen on the first of the year, enough effort has been made by the public and private sector to ensure that Americans are aware of this issue. 
   However, I am concerned that under the current version of S. 96, companies may continue sales of non-Y2K compliant products even after enactment of this act without disclosing non-Y2K compliance to consumers. While I strongly support this important piece of legislation, I am concerned that unscrupulous marketers may attempt to deceive consumers by continuing to sell non-Y2K compliant products. A computer given for a Christmas gift isn't much of a gift when it stops working 7 days later. 
   Thus I planned to offer an amendment to section 5(b)(3) that would lift the cap on punitive damages for products sold after the date of enactment of this act if the plaintiff could have established by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant knowingly sold non-Y2K compliant products absent a signed waiver from the plaintiff. However, I have agreed to defer to the chairman so that this issue can be best addressed in conference.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce modest legislation that will eliminate controversy between the IRS and people who use their automobiles to perform charitable work. 
   Two years, ago I was successful in convincing my colleagues that the standard mileage rate for charitable activities should be raised to 14 cents a mile. I would have preferred that the mileage rate would have been set higher, but at least this was a step in the right direction. 
   It has recently come to my attention that if a charity reimburses a volunteer at a rate higher than 14 cents a mile, the volunteer must include such higher reimbursement in income. Thus, for example, if a person uses his car for a voluntary food delivery program or for patient transportation and the charity reimburses the volunteer 25 cents a mile, the individual would have 11 cents of income. That is absurd, Mr. President, especially when one considers that if a person was performing the same service as an employee of a company, the person could be reimbursed tax-free at the rate of 31 cents a mile. 
   I understand that there have been cases where volunteer drivers have been audited and subjected to back taxes, penalties, and interest because of unreported volunteer mileage reimbursement, even though that reimbursement did not exceed the allowable business rate and the dollar amounts were quite small. Does IRS have nothing better to do than audit such individuals? 
   My bill would eliminate this problem. It provides that all charitable volunteer mileage reimbursement is non-taxable income to the extent that it does not exceed the standard business mileage rate and appropriate records are kept. It is important to note that my bill does not increase the allowable deduction claimed by volunteers who are not reimbursed by a charity.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation on behalf of workers who have responsibly saved for retirement through collectively bargained, multiemployer defined benefit pension plans. I am pleased to be joined by Senators STEVENS and SANTORUM in sponsoring this bill. This legislation would raise the Section 415 limits and ensure that workers are not unfairly penalized in the amount they may receive when they retire. 
   Under the current rules, for some workers, benefit cutbacks resulting from the current rules means that they will not be able to retire when they wanted or needed to. For other workers, it means retirement with less income to live on. 
   The bill that I am introducing today will give all of these workers relief from the most confiscatory provisions of Section 415 and enable them to receive the full measure of their retirement savings. 
   Congress has recognized and corrected the adverse effects of Section 415 on government employee pension plans. Most recently, as part of the Tax Relief Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-34) and the Small Business Jobs Protection Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-188), we exempted government employee pension plans from the compensation-based limit, from certain early retirement limits, and from other provisions of Section 415. Other relief for government employee plans was included in earlier legislation amending Section 415. 
   Section 415 was enacted more then two decades ago when the pension world was quite different than it is today. The Section 415 limits were designed to place limits on pensions that could be received by highly paid executives. The passage of time and Congressional action has stood this original design on its head. The limits are forcing cutbacks in the pensions of middle income workers. 
   Section 415 limits the benefits payable to a worker in a defined benefit  pension plans to the lessor of: (1) the worker's average annual compensation for the three consecutive years when his compensation was the highest [the ``compensation-based limit'']; and (2) a dollar limit that is sharply reduced for retirement before the worker's Social Security normal retirement age. 
   The compensation-based limit assumes that the pension earned under a plan is linked to each worker's salary, as is typical in corporate pension plans. Unfortunately, that formula does not work properly when applied to multiemployer pension plans. Multiemployer plans, which cover more than ten million individuals, have long based their benefits on the collectively bargained contribution rates and years of covered employment with one or more of the multiple employers which contribute to the plan. In other words, benefits earned under a multiemployer plan have no relationship to the wages received by a worker form the contributing employers. The same benefits level is paid to all workers with the same contribution and covered employment records regardless of their individual wage histories. 
   A second assumption underlying the compensation-based limit is that workers' salaries increase steadily over the course of their careers so that the three highest salary years will be the last three consecutive years. While this salary history may be the norm in the corporate world, it is unusual in the multiemployer plan world. In multiemployer plan industries like building and construction, workers' wage earnings typically fluctuate from year-to-year according to several variables, including the availability of covered work and whether the worker is unable to work due to illness or disability. An individual worker's wage history may include many dramatic ups-and-downs. Because of these fluctuations, the three highest years of compensation for many multiemployer plan participants are not consecutive. Consequently, the Section 415 compensation-based limit for the workers is artificially low; lower than it would be if they were covered by corporate plans. 
   Thus, the premises on which the compensation-based limit is founded do not fit the reality of workers covered by multiemployer plans. And, the limit should not apply. 
   This bill would exempt workers covered by multiemployer plans from the compensation-based limit, just as government employees are now exempt. 
   Section 415's dollar limits have also been forcing severe cutbacks in the earned pensions of workers who retire under multiemployer pension plans before they reach age 65. 
   Construction work is physically hard, and is often performed under harsh climatic conditions. Workers are worn down sooner than in most other industries. Often, early retirement is a must. Multiemployer pension plans accommodate these needs of their covered workers by providing for early retirement, disability, and service pensions that provide a subsidized, partial or full pension benefit. 
   Section 415 is forcing cutbacks in these pensions because the dollar limit is severely reduced for each year younger than the Social Security normal retirement age that a worker is when he retires. For a worker who retires at age 50, the reduced dollar limit is now about $40,000 per year. 
   This reduced limit applies regardless of the circumstances under which the worker retires and regardless of his plan's rules regarding retirement age. A multiemployer plan participant worn out after years of physical challenge who is forced into early retirement is nonetheless subject to a reduced limit. A construction worker who, after 30 years of demanding labor, has well earned a 30-and-out service pension at age 50 is nonetheless subject to the reduced limit. 
   This bill will ease this early retirement benefit cutback by extending to workers covered by multiemployer plans some of the more favorable early retirement rules that now apply to government employee pension plans and other retirement plans. These rules still provide for a reduced dollar limit for retirements earlier than age 62, but the reduction is less severe than under the current rules that apply to multiemployer plans.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as we consider S. 96, the Y2K bill, I want to point out an area of concern that will affect many northern states, especially my home state of Alaska. January 1, 2000, will arrive in the middle of winter. Unlike many states in the lower 48, where a power failure on the first of the year is a major inconvenience, a power failure in Alaska can have serious consequences if climate control systems fail. 
   Earlier this year my home town of Fairbanks saw the thermometer plummet below 40 degrees Fahrenheit. While I do not doubt the industrious nature of my fellow Alaskans who have for so long used their ingenuity and determination to survive in Alaska's cold climate, any delay in resolving a health or safety related failure in Alaska cannot only be costly, but also deadly. 
   Therefore, I am offering an amendment that would require that companies notified of a Y2K problem must first respond to requests where the Y2K failures affect the health or safety of the public.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to speak briefly on a bill reported out of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on May 19, 1999. S. 744 provides for the continuation of higher education through the conveyance of certain lands in the State of Alaska to the University of Alaska, and for other purposes. 
   The purpose of S. 744 is to provide Alaska's federal land grant college, the University of Alaska, with a federal land grant of at least 250,000 acres. S. 744 would also transfer to the federal government 29 inholdings currently owned by the University within conservation system units in Alaska. 
   When this bill was passed out of Committee it was done so with an amendment that clarified the lands the University was to relinquish under Section 3 of the bill. Those lands are listed in a document entitled ``The University of Alaska's Inholding and Reconveyance Document'' and dated May 17, 1999. 
   I ask unanimous consent a copy of this document be printed in today's CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from New Mexico. I rise to join with Senators KYL, DOMENICI, and SHELBY to offer an amendment which I feel confident creates accountability in the Department of Energy for protecting our country's national security information. 
   Mr. President, it is clear that the Cox committee report and the Senate's investigation of Chinese espionage at the Labs highlighted, in a sense, a dysfunctional Department of Energy. Even though the Department of Energy's chief of intelligence, Notra Trulock, was ringing alarm bells starting back in 1995, it simply seems that nobody was listening. Today, we find that nobody is accountable. 
   We recognize the structure of the system simply didn't work. For Mr. Trulock to get approval to brief senior officials, he had to go through more junior officials. He could not brief the Congress without approval. He didn't have access to the executive branch. What the amendment that is pending creates is real accountability--accountability at DOE, accountability for the President, and accountability for the Congress. It puts into law an Office of Counterintelligence and mandates that the director report to the Secretary, the President, and the Congress, any actual or potential threat to or loss of national security information. 
   We have seen a situation where the individual responsible simply didn't have the capability to get the message through the process--to any of the four Secretaries of Energy whom we could identify for the record. 
   Further, this would require a report once a year to the Congress regarding the adequacy of the Department of Energy's procedures and policies for protecting national security information, and whether each Department of Energy Lab is in full compliance with all Department of Energy security requirements. The National Labs clearly had different security arrangements previously. 
   The amendment also would prohibit any officer or employee of the Department of Energy or any other Federal agency from interfering with the director's reporting. No interference, Mr. President. 
   Secretary Richardson has introduced several initiatives aimed at correcting the security problems at the Labs. I commend him for his efforts. I welcome the Secretary's initiative, energy, and enthusiasm, but without a legislative overhaul, I doubt his ability to change the mindset at the Department of Energy which has plagued every other reform initiative. 
   It is kind of interesting to go back and look at the attempted reforms. Victor Rezendes, a director of the GAO, who has closely followed security initiatives at the Labs, made the following observation:  
   DOE has often agreed to take corrective action, but the implementation has not been successful.  
   A former head of security at Rocky Flats weapons plant, David Ridenour, was more blunt. He was quoted in USA Today on May 19:  
   It's all the same people and I think they'll continue to fall back into old ways. If there's a problem, classify it, hide it and get rid of the people who brought it up.  
   Recall the so-called Curtis plan, which was put forth by Deputy Secretary Curtis. A good plan, but after Mr. Curtis left the Department, it was either disregarded or forgotten. It was so quickly forgotten, as a matter of fact, that Mr. Curtis' successor as Deputy Secretary wasn't even informed of its existence. There is no excuse for that. 
   The New York Times reported that a November 1998 counterintelligence report contained some shocking warnings, including that foreign spies ``rightly view the Department of Energy as an inviting, diverse and soft target that is easy to access and that employees are willing to share information.'' 
   So change is necessary. I think creating this new line of responsibility will help change the mindset at the Department of Energy. The amendment puts the DOE on the road to accountability by creating under the law an Office of Counterintelligence, an Office of Intelligence, and a Nuclear Security Administration. 
   More legislation, obviously, is going to be needed. We simply don't have all of the answers now. But the Cox report fills in some of the shocking details. After months of investigation, they have revealed frightening information about the true ineptness of the espionage investigation. 
   I understand that the Secretary of Energy opposes this amendment. I am sorry to hear that. I gather he sent a letter up here indicating that he will recommend that the President veto the bill because Congress is taking action to fix the problem. But what does he want Congress to do? Wait to take action until U.S.-designed nuclear weapon warheads are launched at U.S. cities? 
   The problem is precisely that serious. After what we have learned about security failures at the Department of Energy, I dare--I dare--the President to veto this legislation. 
   It is time for action, and that is what we are talking about with this amendment. 
   If one looks at where we are today, I am struck by three revelations. 
   First, we have in the Cox report stunning information about a compromise of our national security that was self-inflicted. We can blame the Chinese for spying. But this happened as a consequence of our own failure to maintain adequate security in the Laboratories. Security of our most important Laboratories has been marginal at best. 
   We find that U.S. companies--Loral and Hughes--allowed their commercial interests to override our national security interests. We gave the Chinese a roadmap on how to shoot their missiles straight and how to arm those missiles with nuclear weapons. Aimed at whom? Well, that is another concern. 
   Second, how much of this happened on President Clinton's watch? 
   Third, the balance of power in the Asia-Pacific region could be affected by the information they have obtained. 
   Based on these finding, I believe now is the time for Congress to demand accountability from those who allowed this to happen. We should not allow the administration to simply promise change with reforms that in previous efforts have been tried but have failed. 
   One would not respond to, say, a burglary by saying that the robber is irrelevant. Our Nation has been robbed. Years of research and hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars are lost to the Chinese. Who is responsible? 
   What should be done is that the Attorney General should testify in public and tell the American people why the Department of Justice denied requests for access to computer and wiretaps.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am really appalled at the state of affairs on the floor. Earlier today, I asked that an order for a quorum call be rescinded in order to discuss further the Kyl amendment which Senator DOMENICI, Senator KYL, and I have participated in developing. I was really disappointed we were denied that opportunity. I am pleased we have this limited time available to us. 
   When we offered the amendment, we each had 10 minutes. That is not very much time to explain it. I had hoped the minority would have granted more time. I can only assume the minority is very much opposed to a full discussion of the circumstances surrounding the greatest breach of our national security, as evidenced by the Cox report which came down yesterday. 
   I am further shocked that the administration has succeeded in temporarily derailing this amendment. And that is what they have done; they have derailed the amendment. The administration seems to be more concerned about how the bureaucracy within the Department of Energy is organized than whether the national security of the United States is protected. We had an obligation prior to this recess to initiate a corrective action within the Department of Energy. The minority has precluded us from proceeding with that opportunity today. 
   As chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I have held seven hearings. These hearings have revealed the shocking, dismal state of security at our weapons labs. Those on the other side do not want to repair it now; they want to study. How long have they studied it? It has gone through at least four Secretaries, that we know of. 
   It has gone back a decade. Why, for the life of me, do we delay now? I don't know. 
   The pending Kyl amendment would have provided some assurances to the Congress and the American people that this will not happen again. This amendment was about accountability--accountability by the Department of Energy, accountability by the Department of Energy laboratories, accountability by the Secretary of Energy, accountability by the President--because it would provide, if you will, reporting not just to the Secretary but to the Congress and to the President. 
   This would have provided accountability to the people of the United States. They are entitled to it. But not now. The administration and the minority have succeeded in derailing it. 
   The opponents of the amendment claim that it would make the DOE, the Department of Energy, bureaucracy unworkable. Well, I have news for you. Unworkable? It is already unworkable. That bureaucracy is so unworkable, it has allowed all our secrets--all our secrets--that we have spent billions of dollars on, to simply pass over to the Chinese, and perhaps other nations as well. 
   The Department of Energy's bureaucracy has proven time and time again that no matter how diligent any individual Secretary of Energy is, the bureaucracy can outwait the Secretary, the bureaucracy can ignore the Secretary, the bureaucracy can do whatever it pleases without fear of any consequences. 
   Let me just give you one example. 
   In 1996, the Deputy Secretary of Energy, Charles Curtis, implemented the so-called Curtis Plan. It was a security plan. It was a good plan. It was a plan to enhance security at the DOE laboratories. 
   But in early 1997 he left the Department of Energy. And guess what. Not only did the Department of Energy bureaucracy ignore the Curtis Plan, the DOE bureaucracy did not even tell the new Secretary about the Curtis Plan. 
   I have had the opportunity in hearings to personally ask the new Secretary if he was familiar with the Curtis Plan. The specific response was: Well, it was never transmitted. 
   Why wasn't it transmitted? 
   Well, we don't know. We just have fingers pointing the fingers back and forth. 
   I certainly commend Secretary Richardson for his efforts to improve security. He has improved security. But the plans, the traditional Department of Energy security plans, seem to have the life of a fruit fly. 
   The loss of our nuclear weapons secrets is just too important to ignore or to trust to the bureaucracy of an agency that has time and time again proven that it simply cannot be trusted, because the bureaucracy does not work, the checks and balances are not there. 
   So I am extremely disappointed that the Secretary has said in a letter he will demand that the President veto the bill because Congress is taking action--Congress is taking action--to fix the problem. Can you imagine that? We are taking action to fix the problem, and they are saying it is too hasty, we should not fix the problem. 
   This is just part of the problem. This amendment is just part of the answer.  But at least we are trying to do something. The Democrats on the other side say: Oh, no, you're too early. 
   The pending amendment would have created accountability and responsibility for protecting the national security at the Department of Energy; but not now, as a result of the administration's objections. 
   The pending amendment would have created three new organizations within the Department of Energy to protect our national secrets; but not now, as a result objections from the minority and the administration. 
   The pending amendment would require the Department of Energy to fully inform the President and the Congress about any threat to 
   or loss of national security information; but not now, as a result of the objections of the minority and the administration. 
   President Clinton will rightfully be able to claim ignorance--claim ignorance--again on what is going on, because he will be ignorant of what is going on. 
   The amendment would have prohibited anyone in the Department of Energy or the administration from interfering with reporting to Congress about any threat to or loss of our Nation's national security information; but not now, as a result of the objections of the minority and the administration. 
   The amendment would have required the Department of Energy to report to Congress every year regarding the adequacy of the Department of Energy's procedures and policies for protection of national security information and whether each DOE laboratory is in full compliance with all the DOE security requirements; but not now, as a result of the objections of the minority and the administration. 
   The amendment would have required each Department of Energy laboratory director to certify in writing whether that laboratory is in full compliance with all departmental national security information protection requirements; but not now, as a result of the objections of the minority and the administration. 
   In short, this amendment would have gone far--not all the way--but it would have gone far in preventing further loss of our nuclear weapons secrets to China; but not now--well, it is evident--as a result of the objections by the minority and by the administration. 
   I suggest that the administration has made a tragic mistake, that the minority has made a tragic mistake. The American people expect a response from the Congress, the Senate, now in this matter--not next week or next month. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. 
   I ask what the time remaining is.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we have had a lot of conversation here on the floor as we have looked at the examples of finger-pointing. It is apparent also that we have had bungling at the very highest level. 
   I'd like to share a couple of examples with my colleagues. Why wasn't Wen Ho Lee's computer searched to prevent the loss of our secrets? Because the FBI claims that the DOE told the FBI that there was no waiver. The FBI then assumed they needed a warrant to search. 
   Well, Wen Ho Lee did sign a computer access waiver. This is the waiver on this chart. I can't tell you how many days of communication it took to get this waiver, because the first explanation was that it didn't exist. When the FBI asked the Department of Energy if there was a waiver on Wen Ho Lee, the Department of Energy examined their records and they could not find a waiver. Here is a waiver signed by Wen Ho Lee, April 19, 1995. It says:  
   These systems are monitored and recorded and subject to audit. Any unauthorized access or use of this LAN is prohibited and could be subject to criminal and civil penalties. I understand and agree to follow these rules.  
   There it is. We found it. What is the result? Lee's computer could have been searched, but instead was not searched for 3 long years. There was a waiver the entire time. What is the excuse of the bureaucrats for that? They point to one another. 
   Then there is the role of the Justice Department. The Justice Department thwarted the investigation by refusing to approve a warrant, not once, twice, but three times. We still have not heard a reasonable explanation. The Attorney General owes to the American people and the taxpayers an explanation as to why it was turned down. 
   What is frightening, as well as frustrating, is that nobody put our national security as the priority. The FBI and the Department of Justice were more concerned about jumping through unnecessary legal hoops than about preventing one of the most catastrophic losses in history. The events involved throughout the Lee case are not only irresponsible, they are unconscionable. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we will soon vote on a $15 billion spending bill that will, among other things, further fund the war against Yugoslavia. Although the Administration requested some $6 billion for military and humanitarian needs for the Kosovo operation, this amount has almost doubled, and is well over $11 billion. Sadly, this higher figure will not get our readiness back where it needs to be--where we could, at the drop of the hat, successfully wage two full scale wars at the same time--as directed in the ``Quadrennial Defense Review.'' 
   It also illustrates something seriously gone wrong here in Washington, D.C. Only a small amount of these funds are subject to offsets--its as if there is this notion, both in the Administration and in Congress, that this is ``free money.'' Well it's not, Mr. President. For every dollar spent, another priority loses out. And I can think of a whole host of areas where this money would be better spent than in fighting a war in a part of the world where most Americans can't clearly identify on a map. Tax cuts, Social Security, Education, to name just a few. 
   I will vote against this bill for two reasons: (1) our Kosovo policy is seriously flawed and the only way we in Congress can truly voice our opposition is voting where it hurts the most--the pocketbook; and (2) this is a spending bill gone mad--there is no fiscal accountability here, nor is there any notion of fiscal responsibility. 
   This vote, at least for me, will be one of the toughest I have had to cast in my tenure in the United States Senate. I strongly support our military, and am proud of our men and women in uniform. I certainly do not want to jeopardize our people who are charged with carrying out this war. But even so, this is not a vote against our military--rather, it is a vote in opposition  to the Administration's seriously flawed, if not inept Kosovo policy. 
   No one disputes that Milosevic is a bad person and that he should be stopped. His brutal, persistent attacks on the Albanian Kosovar people is akin to Germany in the Second World War. But air strikes alone are not going to do it--they will level Yugoslavia, destroy most of its infrastructure, terrorize its civilian population, and most likely, not be successful stopping Milosevic. 
   I do not believe that our war fighters' are being given sufficient latitude to make this mission a success. Their decisions are subject to dual-review: (1) the ``political'' review of the White House; and (2) the ``consensus'' of our NATO allies through every step of the war. 
   A few examples. General Clark's request to deploy gunships continues to be denied by ``senior military advisors in Washington, D.C.'' Who are these people? The Joint-Chiefs of Staff? Or Sandy Berger and Madeleine Albright? 
   It took over a month to get Apache helicopters to the region; and they sit grounded because the ``polls'' show no support for a ground campaign. 
   It seems to me that one of the first priorities in waging a war is to cut off the supply lines of the other side--and oil, in particular, so that they cannot fuel their tanks and planes. 
   Unbelievably, the NATO alliance refused to cut off the flow of fuel that fires Milosevic's war machine. Although the U.S. proposed a blockade to stop the oil, it was defeated by France which opposed implementing a blockade without a formal declaration of war. 
   We are executing massive, full scale air bombings every day; people are being killed; but the French believe a declaration of war must be a precondition for a blockade. 
   Our bombs have gone off course several times, hitting refugee convoys, the country of Bulgaria, and the Chinese embassy in Belgrade--which is technically Chinese soil in Yugoslavia. 
   At least in the case of the Chinese embassy, it wasn't the bombs at fault, it was our intelligence. Although the tourist maps in Belgrade accurately place the Chinese embassy in that locale, our intelligence was using an outdated map that led them to believe it was a procurement center for the Serbian military. 
   The Chinese people are outraged, and well they should be. But the American people should be just as outraged--not just by this 
   bombing, but by the continued incompetence which has come to typify this policy. 
   I fail to understand how waging this war by NATO consensus is getting us anywhere except more deeply involved militarily, and less likely to find a diplomatic solution to this crisis. Mr. President, wars should not be waged by consensus, and diplomacy should not be directed by polls. 
   Internationally, the world is a much less stable place than it was even two months before. There was a sense of optimism that Russia might help broker a diplomatic solution to Kosovo. The possibility remains, but Russia is far less stable than previously thought: President Yeltsin survived an impeachment proceeding, but he has again disbanded his government to the degree that it is unclear who in Russia has the power to help negotiate an end to this crisis. 
   The Chinese are no longer just a sideline observer. While China has opposed the NATO bombings from the outset, it didn't have a dog in this fight until we bombed their embassy in Belgrade. If a deal on Kosovo is reached, it will have to pass muster with the Chinese who hold veto authority on the U.N. Security Council. 
   We continue to bomb Iraq daily--stretching our Air Force readiness even further. Saddam Hussein shows no signs of letting up, and will most likely use this as an opportunity to push us even further. 
   And last, but not least, the Korean Peninsula continues to be a crisis in waiting. Starvation in North Korea is rampant, food supplies are gone, and the country is undergoing one of the worst droughts in history. If the North Koreans decide to engage us militarily, we will be fighting three wars at the same time--beyond that envisioned by our military strategists in the Quadrennial Defense Review, and perhaps much more than we are currently prepared to do. 
   Again, we will soon vote on this supplemental funding package. Over $15 billion. And when the war is over, we will be asked to vote on additional funding to rebuild Yugoslavia. We will probably vote to rebuild the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. And if we approve additional funds for the military campaign, the end costs of rebuilding Yugoslavia will only continue to mount. 
   My vote does not undermine my support, concern or pride for our military. But I do believe that a diplomatic solution to this problem should have been found, can still be found, and must be found if we are to avoid the further escalation of this war. Failure to do so will cost us precipitously--not just in dollars, but in American lives. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to give tribute to Admiral Bud Nance. His recent death is a great loss to this institution and to this country. His list of accomplishments is long, his list of friends even longer. I want to express my sympathy to his wife and family. I also want to extend that same sympathy to my friend from North Carolina, Senator HELMS, who has lost a great friend and advisor. 
   I first met Bud in 1991 when he came out of a well-deserved military retirement and took over as Staff Director of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I was a member of the Committee at that time. His career as a Navy Commander brought a steady hand and a cool head to the Committe. I knew that when I had new staff member starting in the Senate I could send him or her to Bud and he would put the staff member on the right track with his fatherly guidance. His maturity and mentoring role will be almost impossible to replace. I also knew that Bud would provide me with clear-headed advice. He was plain spoken and honest, and I truly admired him for that. Even after I left the Committee, I often turned to Bud for assistance or guidance on a particular issue, and he always gave me an honest answer. That counts for a lot up here.  
   Mr. President, the Admiral's many accomplishments have been noted previously by my colleagues. Although I knew of his military background prior to joining the Senate, Bud was too modest to let the rest of us in on just what he had gone through in his previous career as a Navy officer. He saw active duty in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. It has been reported that during World War II he endured 162 Japanese air and kamikaze attacks. One of the papers reminded me of one of Bud's great lines when the Committee was considering whether U.S. Ambassadors should receive additional benefits, including hardship pay. ``I fought at Iwo Jima,'' he said, ``That's hardship.'' His life experiences helped him keep our work here in perspective. 
   Mr. President, I noted the obituary from the Charlotte Observer was entitled, ``Bud Nance, Monroe Native Was an Officer and a Gentleman.'' This was certainly a fitting description of the man, and he will be remembered fondly by all who knew him.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, at the request of the Administration, Senator BINGAMAN and I are introducing the President's proposed electricity legislation. The Administration's legislation is being introduced as two separate bills because Title X of their proposed legislation amends the Internal Revenue Code. I will speak first with respect to the restructuring portion of the Administration's legislation, Titles I through IX. 
   Mr. President, I am not introducing the restructuring portion of the Administration's legislation because I support it--I do not. Some of its provisions I agree with, but many of its key provisions I am opposed to. Instead, I am introducing the Administration's legislation in order to initiate the debate in the hope that through the legislative process Congress can craft legislation that will enjoy bipartisan support and will benefit consumers. 
   At the outset, let me observe that our electric power industry isn't broken. We have the finest electric system in the world bar none. Our electric utilities have done an excellent job supplying electricity to the consumers of this Nation. As a result, today electricity is both reliable and reasonably-priced. But that isn't to say that improvements cannot, and should not, be made. I believe that consumers will benefit through enhanced competition. The key question we face is: Should we try to enhance competition through increased reliance on the free market, or through increased use of government regulation? I think the answer is self evident. 
   Although deregulation is our goal, some regulation will remain necessary to protect consumers. However, such regulation should not be made the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal government, as some have suggested. The retail market has traditionally been the jurisdiction of the States, and it should remain that way. States are the closest to the people, and are best able to determine what is in their consumers' best interests. Let me speak now about some of the key provisions of the Administration's legislation. 
   There are several important components of the Administration's legislation that I strongly support. For example, it proposes to repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA) and the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA), two anticompetitive laws that cost consumers billions of dollars every year in above-market electric rates. If we do nothing else, repeal of PUHCA and PURPA would materially advance competition and reduce electric rates to consumers. 
   The Administration's legislation also shows a clear interest in addressing several contentious issues left out in their bill in the last Congress. For example, the Administration's legislation includes provisions that will begin the debate on what to do about the Federal utilities--the Federal power marketing administrations and the Tennessee Valley Authority. The Administration's legislation also takes a significant step forward by addressing the very difficult issue of creating a level playing field between municipal and private utilities--the tax-exempt municipal bond issue. This is an issue that must be dealt with. The Administration's bill also addresses reliability and it makes all wholesale transmission open access, two very important matters. Also of note is the Administration's recognition of the need to deal with the high cost of electricity in rural communities. Senator DASCHLE and I have introduced legislation to deal with this problem, and the Administration's legislation incorporates part of our bill. 
   There are, however, several provisions in the Administration's legislation that I am opposed to. First, I do not support its Federal retail competition mandate which overrides State law. I see no need for this. The States are moving aggressively to implement retail competition in a manner and a time frame that benefits consumers. According to the DOE's Energy Information Administration, twenty States have already enacted restructuring legislation or issued a comprehensive regulatory order. More than half the U.S. population live in these twenty States. Again according to DOE's Energy Information Administration, twenty-eight of the remaining thirty States are in the process of deciding what is in the best interests of its residents. Accordingly I ask: With States making such good progress on retail competition what need is there for a Federal mandate--assuming such a mandate is Constitutional? Moreover, because the Administration's proposed mandate would apply even to the twenty States that have already acted, I am concerned that such a Federal mandate would upset the progress these States have made. In this connection, I am not convinced that the Administration's ``opt-out'' provision will in fact  protect consumers from the adverse consequences of Federally-mandated retail competition. 
   Second, the bill's so-called ``renewable portfolio mandate'' is also a significant problem. For reasons that I do not understand, the Administration has decided to exclude hydroelectric power from the definition of renewable energy, even though hydro is this Nation's most significant renewable energy source. Without hydroelectric power being counted, to meet this new Federal mandate ``renewable'' generation would have to increase to 7.5 percent by the year 2010. Clearly, an impossibility. 
   Third, I am also troubled with the Administration's so-called ``public benefits'' fund. It puts a Federal $3 billion per year tax on electric consumers, that a Federal board gets to spend for vaguely defined public purposes. It also appears to require a matching $3 billion per year State expenditure. At the very outset, this eats up a very large share of the claimed consumer savings resulting from enactment of the Administration's bill. 
   Finally, the Administration's bill also contains numerous new Federal 
   oversight, regulatory and environmental programs, many of which give the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission major oversight--much of which comes at the expense of the States. There are far too many of these in the Administration's legislation to identify and discuss here. Some of these may be worthwhile, but clearly many are not. Each will have to be carefully scrutinized and will have to be justified on their own merits if it is to be included in a final bill. I will speak now about the tax provisions of the Administration's proposed legislation which I am introducing as a separate measure. 
   Mr. President, at the request of the Administration I am also introducing the portion of their electricity restructuring bill that deals with tax-exempt debt issued by municipal utilities. This is Title X of the Administration's proposed legislation. In addiition, the Administration's bill clarifies the tax rules regarding contributions to nuclear decommissioning costs. 
   Mr. President, if consumers and businesses are to maximize the full benefits of open competition in this industry it will be necessary for all electricity providers to interconnect their families into the entire electric grid. Unfortunately, this system efficiency is significantly impaired because of current tax law rules that effectively preclude public power entities--entities that financed their facilities with tax-exempt bonds--from participating in State open access restructuring plans, without jeopardizing the exempt status of their bonds. 
   No one wants to see bonds issued to finance public power become retroactively taxable because a municipality chooses to participate in a state open access plan. That would cause havoc in the financial markets and could undermine the financial stability of many municipalities. At the same time, public power should be obtain a competitive advantage in the open marketplace based on the federal subsidy that flows from the ability to issue tax-exempt debt. 
   The Administration's proposal attempts to resolve this issue by prohibiting public power facilities from issuing new tax-exempt bonds for generating facilities and transmission facilities. However, tax exempt debt could be issued for new distribution facilities. In addition, the Administration's proposal ensures that outstanding bonds would not lose their tax-exempt status if transmission facilities violate the private use rules because of a FERC order requiring non-discriminatory open access to such facilities. Outstanding debt for generation would not lose it's tax-exempt status if the private use rules were triggered simply because the entity entered into a contract in response to a marketplace based on competition. 
   Mr. President, I am not endorsing every concept in the tax portion of the Administration's proposal. I believe it is a good starting point for discussion of how we transition from a regulated environment to a free market competitive landscape. It is my hope that the public power and the investor owned utilities will sit down and come to a reasonable compromise on how to resolve the tax issues affecting the industry. My door is always open to hear all sides on this issue and see whether we can fix the problems that exist in the tax code so that competition in the industry becomes a reality. 
   Mr. President, the introduction of the Administration's bill is just the beginning of a very long and arduous process. I hope to be able to work with the electric power industry, my Republican and Democratic colleagues to both the Finance Committee and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and DOE Secretary Richardson to craft legislation that will benefit consumers and our Nation.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the production of oil and gas in the United States is fast becoming a thing of the past. I am introducing two bills today to halt, and if possible, reverse that trend. 
   The economic consequences of the 1973 oil embargo were severe and long lasting. Whole sectors of our economy underwent significant changes and dislocations. Parts of the United States were plunged into recession which remained for a decade as they adjusted to the fluctuations and insecurity of energy supplies in the 1970's. At the time of the embargo, imports made up 36% of our oil consumption. 
   Our foreign policy was modified to reflect our growing dependence and protecting oil-producing regions of the world took on a new importance. By the time of the Gulf War of 1990-91, oil imports were roughly 50%. 
   Today, the United States depends upon foreign sources for some 56% of our supply. This is despite Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE) standards for cars which have almost doubled gas mileage. This is despite the creation of the Department of Energy. This is despite the untold billions of dollars which have been invested by U.S. industry in energy-saving equipment and processes in order to remain competitive in a world economy. 
   If no changes are made in federal policy to protect our domestic oil and gas industry--the ``pilot light'' of our nation's economy and security upon which all productive enterprise depends--our future indeed may be bleak. The Department of Energy predicts 68% dependency on foreign oil by the year 2010. This is just shy of a doubling of our oil imports since the embargo of 1973. 
   In two recent hearings the Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee examined the state of the domestic oil and gas industries and their future. What we learned has been the impetus for my introduction of these bills today. 
   During the past 18 months, 136,000 U.S. oil wells and 57,000 gas wells have been shut in. 50,000 men and women throughout the United States have lost their jobs in these industries--15% of all employees. With operating oil rigs at an all-time low and new investment in the U.S. drying up, the future for domestic production of oil and gas is grim. 
   While the consumption of natural gas is favored by the Administration as a means to reduce emissions, unless changes are made now in federal policy to make production and delivery of natural gas easier, the projected 50% increase in the need for natural gas by the year 2010 will not be met without severe price shocks for American citizens. 
   The price of oil today is high enough for investment in the U.S. by those who will or can still invest in our domestic oil and gas economy. However, the fact is that the fundamentals for investment in America are not good. Access to prospective areas is severely restricted, environmental costs are extremely high and production rates from U.S. wells are liable to be quite low, in comparison to other areas in the world.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, pursuant to an executive communication referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, at the request of the Department of Energy, I introduce a bill cited as the ``Energy Policy and Conservation Act Amendments.'' The bill would amend and extend certain authorities in the Energy and Policy Conservation Act which either have expired or will expire September 30, 1999. I would like to submit a copy of the transmittal letter and the text of the bill and ask that it be printed in the RECORD. I do this on behalf of myself and Senator BINGAMAN. 
   The Act was passed in 1975. Title I of the Act authorized the creation and maintenance of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve that would be used to mitigate shortages during an oil supply disruption. Title II contains authorities essential for meeting key United States obligations to the International Energy Agency. 
   The proposed legislation would extend the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and International Energy Program authorities to September 30, 2003. It would also delete or amend certain provisions which are outdated or unnecessary.

As reported by the Committee last Congress, the legislation would have created an industry committee to establish minimum wage levels similar to committees that had been created for other territories and that still exist for American Samoa. The legislation would also have established a mechanism for the extension of federal immigration laws if the government of the Northern Marianas proved unable or unwilling to adopt and enforce an effective immigration system. The legislation that I am introducing today does not include any provisions dealing with wages. I continue to believe that an industry committee is preferable to outright extension of federal wage rates, but the Northern Marianas, the Administration, and some of my cosponsors would prefer to have that debate on another vehicle. 
   Immigration, however, is at the heart of the problems facing the Northern Marianas. This legislation reflects the recommendation of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources last Congress. What appears on the surface to be a prosperous diversified economy in the Northern Marianas, is in fact a far more fragile economy that is becoming ever more dependent on a system of imported labor. Unemployment among US residents remains high and the public sector is rapidly becoming the only source of employment for US citizens residing in the Marianas. The public sector workforce has doubled over the past several years and payroll is the largest expense of the government. The recent downturn in tourism as a result of economic problems in Asia has only served to aggravate the situation in the Marianas, increase the pressures on public sector employment, and tighten the dependence of the Marianas on imported labor for the private sector, mainly garment manufacturing. 
   The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) is a three hundred mile archipelago consisting of fourteen islands stretching north of Guam. The largest inhabited islands are Saipan, Rota, and Tinian. Magellan landed at Saipan in 1521 and the area was controlled by Spain until the end of the Spanish American War. Guam, the southernmost of the Marianas, was ceded to the United States following the Spanish-American War and the balance sold to Germany together with the remainder of Spain's possessions in the Caroline and Marshall Islands. 
   Japan seized the area during World War I and became the mandatory power under a League of Nations Mandate for Germany's possessions north of the equator on December 17, 1920. By the 1930's Japan had developed major portions of the area and begun to fortify the islands. Guam was invaded by Japanese forces from Saipan in 1941. The Marianas were secured after heavy fighting in 1944 and the bases on Tinian were used for the invasion of Okinawa and for raids on Japan, including the nuclear missions on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In 1947, the Mandated islands were placed under the United Nations trusteeship system as the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI) and the United States was appointed as the Administering Authority. The area was divided into six administrative districts with the headquarters located in Hawaii and then in Guam. The TTPI was the only ``strategic'' trusteeship with review by the Security Council rather than the General Assembly of the United Nations. The Navy administered the Trusteeship, together with Guam, until 1951, when administrative jurisdiction was transferred to the Department of the Interior. The Northern Marianas, however, were returned to Navy jurisdiction from 1952-1962. In 1963, administrative headquarters were moved to Saipan. 
   With the establishment of the Congress of Micronesia in 1965, efforts to reach an agreement on the future political status of the area began. Attempts to maintain a political unity within the TTPI were unsuccessful, and each of the administrative districts (Kosrae eventually separated from Pohnpei District in the Carolines) sought to retain its separate identity. Four of the districts became the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshalls became the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Palau became the Republic of Palau, all sovereign countries in free association with the United States under Compacts of Free Association. The Marianas had sought reunification with Guam and US territorial status from the beginning of the Trusteeship. Separate negotiations with the Marianas began in December, 1972 and concluded in 1975. 
   In 1976, Congress approved a Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States (PL 94-241). The Covenant had been approved in a United Nations observed plebescite in the Northern Mariana Islands and formed the basis for the termination of the United Nations Trusteeship with respect to the Northern Mariana Islands in 1986 together with the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. Prior to termination, those provisions of the Covenant that were not inconsistent with the status of the area (such as extension of US sovereignty) were made applicable by the US as Administering Authority. Upon termination of the Trusteeship, the CNMI became a territory of the United States and its residents became United States citizens. Under the terms of the Covenant certain federal laws would be inapplicable in the CNMI, including minimum wage to take into consideration the relative economic situation of the islands and their relation to other east Asian countries. 
   Although the population of the CNMI was only 15,000 people in 1976 when the Covenant went into effect, the population now exceeds 60,000 and US citizens are a minority. The resident population is probably about 24,000 with about 28,000 alien workers and estimates of at least 10,000 illegal aliens. Permits for non-resident workers were reported at 22,500 for 1994, the largest category being for manufacturing. Tourism has climbed from about 230,000  visitors in 1987 to almost 600,000 in 1994. Total revenues for the CNMI for 1993 were estimated at $157 million. 
   The 1995 census statistics from the Commonwealth list unemployment at 7.1%, with CNMI born at 14.2% and Asia born at 4.5%. Since no guest workers should be on island without jobs, the 4.5% suggests a serious problem in the CNMI. The 14.2% local unemployment suggests that either guest workers are taking jobs from local residents, or the wage rates or types 
   of occupation are not adequate to attract local workers. 
   The Covenant established a unique system in the CNMI under which the local government controlled immigration and minimum wage levels and also had the benefit of duty and quota free entry of manufactured goods under the provisions of General Note 3(a) of the Harmonized Tariff Schedules. The Section by Section analysis of the Committee Report on the Covenant provides in part:  
   Section 503.--This section deals with certain laws of the United States which are not now applicable to the Northern Mariana Islands and provides that they will remain inapplicable except in the manner and to the extent that they are made applicable by specific legislation enacted after the termination of the Trusteeship. These laws are: 
   The Immigration and Naturalization Laws (subsection (a)). The reason this provision is included is to cope with the problems which unrestricted immigration may impose upon small island communities. Congress is aware of those problems. ..... It may well be that these problems will have been solved by the time of the termination of the Trusteeship Agreement and that the Immigration and Nationality Act containing adequate protective provisions can then be introduced to the Northern Mariana Islands. ..... 
   The same consideration applies to the introduction of the Minimum Wage Laws. (Subsection (c)). Congress realizes that the special conditions prevailing in the various territories require different treatment. ..... In these circumstances, it would be inappropriate to introduce the Act to the Northern Mariana Islands without preliminary studies. There is nothing which would prevent the Northern Mariana Islands from enacting their own Minimum Wage Legislation. Moreover, as set forth in section 502(b), the activities of the United States and its contractors in the Northern Mariana Islands will be subject to existing pertinent Federal Wages and Hours Legislation. (S. Rept. 94-433, pp.77-78)  
   The Committee anticipated that by the termination of the Trusteeship, the federal government would have found some way of preventing a large influx of persons into the Marianas, recognizing the Constitutional limitations on restrictions on travel. In part, the Covenant attempted to deal with that possibility by enacting a restraint on land alienation for twenty-five years, subject to extension by the CNMI. The minimum wage issue was more difficult, especially in light of the Committee's experience in the Pacific. The extension of minimum wage to Kwajalein was a proximate cause of the overcrowding at Ebeye in the Kwajalein Atoll as hundreds of Marshallese moved to the small island in hope of obtaining a job at the Missile Range. The CNMI, at the time the Covenant was negotiated, had a limited private sector economy and was under the overall Trust Territory minimum wage, which was considerably lower than the federal minimum wage. The Marianas also had been a closed security area until the early 1960's, further limiting development. Congress fully expected that the Marianas would establish its own schedule and would, within a reasonable time frame, raise minimum wages as the local economy grew. At the time of the Covenant, Guam's local minimum wage exceeded the federal levels, and the Committee anticipated that the Northern Marianas would mirror the history of Guam. 
   Shortly after the Covenant went into effect, the CNMI began to experience a growth in tourism and a need for workers in both the tourist and construction industries. Interest also began to grow in the possibility of textile production. Initial interest was in production of sweaters made of cotton, wool and synthetic fibers. The CNMI, like the other territories, except for Puerto Rico, is outside the U.S. customs territory but can import products manufactured in the territory duty free provided that the products meet a certain value added amount under General Note 3(a) of the Tariff Schedules (then called Headnote 3(a)). The first company began operation in October, 1983 and within a year was joined by two other companies. Total employment for the three firms was 250 of which 100 were local residents. At the time, Guam had a single firm, Sigallo-Pac, also engaged in sweater manufacture with 275 workers, all of whom, however, were U.S. citizens. 
   Attempts by territories to develop textile or apparel industries have traditionally met resistence from Stateside industries. The use of alien labor in the CNMI intensified that concern, and efforts began in 1984 to sharply cut back or eliminate the availability of duty free treatment for the territories. The concerns also complicated Senate consideration of the Compacts of Free Association in 1985 and led to a delay of several months in floor consideration when some Members sought to attach textile legislation to the Compact legislation. By 1986, conditions led the Assistant Secretary, Territorial and International Affairs of the Department of the Interior to write the Governor on the situation and that ``[w]ithout timely and effective action to reverse the current situation, I must consider proposing Congressional enactment of U.S. Immigration and Naturalization requirements for the NMI''. 
   By 1990, the population of the CNMI was estimated at 43,345 of whom only 16,752 had been born in the CNMI. Of the 26,593 born elsewhere, 2,491 had entered from 1980-1984, 2,591 had entered in 1985 or 1986, 6,438 had entered in 1987 or 1988, and 12,955 had entered in 1989 or 1990. Of the population in 1990, 21,332 were classified as Asian. The labor force (all persons 16+ years including temporary alien labor) grew from 9,599 in 1980 to 32,522 in 1990. Manufacturing grew from 1.9% of the workforce in 1980 to 21.9% in 1990, only slightly behind construction which grew from 16.8% to 22.2% in the same time frame. The construction numbers track a major increase in hotel construction. At the same time, increases in the minimum wage were halted although wages paid to U.S. citizens (mainly public sector and management) exceeded federal levels. 
   In 1993, in response to Congressional concerns, the CNMI stated that it proposed to enact legislation to raise the wage rates from $2.15 to federal levels by stages and that legislation would be enacted to prevent any abuse of workers. 
   Repeated allegations of violations of applicable federal laws relating to worker health and safety, concerns with respect to immigration problems, including the admission of undesirable aliens, and reports of worker abuse, especially in the domestic and garment worker sectors, led to the inclusion of a $7 million set aside in appropriations in 1994 to support federal agency presence in the CNMI. The Administration was not prepared to commit agency resources to the CNMI absent the funding, but with an agreement for reimbursement, the Department of the Interior reported to the Committee on April 24, 1995 that: 
   1) $3 million would be used by the CNMI for a computerized immigration identification and tracking system and for local projects; 
   2) $2.2 million would be used by the Department of Justice to strengthen law enforcement, including the hiring of an additional FBI agent and Assistant US Attorney; 
   3) $1.6 million would be used by Labor for two senior investigators as well as for training; and 
   4) $200,000 would be used by Treasury for assistance in investigating violations of federal law with respect to firearms, organized crime, and counterfeiting. 
   In addition, the report recommended that federal law be enacted to phase in the current CNMI minimum wage rates to the federal minimum wage level in 30 cent increments (as then provided by CNMI legislation), end mandatory assistance to the CNMI when the current agreement was fulfilled, continue annual support of federal agencies at a $3 million/year level (which would include funding for a detention facility that meets federal standards), and possible extension of federal immigration laws. 
   During the 104th Congress, the Senate passed S. 638, legislation supported by the Administration, that in part would have enacted the phase in of the CNMI minimum wage rate to US levels in 30 cent increments. No action was taken by the House, and, in the interim, the CNMI delayed the scheduled increases and then instituted a limited increase of 30 cents/hour except for the garment and construction industries  where the increase was limited to 15 cents/hour. The legislation also required the Commonwealth ``to cooperate in the identification and, if necessary, exclusion or deportation from the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands of persons who represent security or law enforcement risks to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or the United States.'' (Section 4 of S. 638) At the same time that Congress began to consider legislation on minimum wage and immigration issues, concern over the commitment of federal agencies to administer and enforce those federal laws already applicable to the CNMI led the Committee to include a provision in S. 638 that the annual report on the law enforcement initiative also include: ``(6) the reasons why Federal agencies are unable or unwilling to fully and effectively enforce Federal laws applicable within the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands unless such activities are funded by the Secretary of the Interior.'' (Section 3 of S. 638) 
   In February, 1996, I led a Committee trip to the CNMI. We met with local and federal officials as well as inspecting a garment factory and meeting with Bangladesh security guards who had not been paid and who were living in substandard conditions. Their living conditions were intolerable. There was no running water, no workable toilets, the shack--and that is being kind--was in deplorable condition. As I said at the time, this was a condition that should never exist on American soil. It existed in the shadow of the Hyatt Hotel. 
   I raised my concerns with the Governor and with other officials in Saipan. We were assured that corrective action would be taken. Those assurances, especially those dealing with minimum wages, seem to have disappeared as soon as our plane was airborne. As a result of the meetings and continued expressions of concern over conditions, the Committee held an oversight hearing on June 26, 1996 to review the situation in the CNMI. At the hearing, the acting Attorney General of the Commonwealth requested that the Committee delay any action on legislation until the Commonwealth could complete a study on minimum wage and promised that the study would be completed by January. That timing would have enabled the Committee to revisit the issue in the April-May 1997 period after the Administration had transmitted its annual report on the law enforcement initiative. While the CNMI Study was not finally transmitted until April, the Administration did not transmit its annual report, which was due in April, until July. On May 30, 1997, the President wrote the Governor of the Northern Marianas that he was concerned over activities in the Commonwealth and had concluded that federal immigration, naturalization, and minimum wage laws should apply. 
   Given the reaction that followed the President's letter, I asked the Administration to provide a drafting service of the language needed to implement the recommendations in the annual report and informed the Governor of the Commonwealth of the request and that the Committee intended to consider the legislation after the Commonwealth had an opportunity to review it. The drafting service was not provided until October 6, 1997 and was introduced on October 8, 1997, shortly before the elections in the CNMI. The Committee deferred hearings so as not to intrude unnecessarily into local politics and to allow the CNMI an opportunity to review and comment on the legislation after the local elections.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the work of three Girl Scouts from Ketchikan, Alaska. Angela Pfeifer, Chelsea Pfeifer and Tennille Walker are each working towards the Girl Scout Gold Award. As a part of their service, they are attempting to enhance the visibility, respect and care of the American flag in Ketchikan. 
   The following is an excerpt from a letter in which Chelsea explains the pride and respect she has for our nation's flag.  
   This Spring Break I went down to Florida to visit my grandparents. My Grandfather served in World War II. At 87, he still put up the U.S. flag every morning, and takes it down every night. It makes my think of the number of people who died serving this country, so that we could have the freedoms that we enjoy today. The flag serves as a symbol of the respect and honor that should be given to those who fought. I observed that many of the retired people display the Flag proudly on a daily basis outside their homes. It would be my goal to see that my generation carry out this tradition and be proud to be an American.  
   In their efforts to instill this same sense of pride and respect. Chelsea, Angela and Tennille have conducted school assemblies at Ketchikan area elementary schools, have placed flags in every classroom at Ketchikan High School and have spoken to local governments officials about erecting a new flag pole in Ketchikan City Park. 
   Currently, there is no flag flying in Ketchikan City Park. Angela, Chelsea and Tennille have addressed this with Ketchikan--Gateway Borough Mayor Jack Shay. As a result, the Mayor and Borough Assembly agreed to install a flag pole in City Park. 
   It is my honor to present these three outstanding Alaskans with an American flag flown over the United States Capitol. The flag will be presented to the City of Ketchikan on June 14, 1999, Flag Day, and will be the first flag to fly in City Park. 
   I commend the work of Angela, Chelsea and Tennille and the Girl Scouts of Ketchikan. They have shown their ability to make a difference and have made a lasting impression on their community.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the motion to table the resolution authorizing the President to use whatever force and means necessary to carry the military campaign against Yugoslavia to a successful conclusion. As written, this resolution would provide the President with blanket authority to wage this war, including the right to deploy ground troops in the Balkans. There are too many unanswered, if not ignored questions about this war. If the Senate were to give the President this blanket authorization, we would abrogate our responsibility to our troops and to the American people to get real answers to these questions. 
   First of all, what would constitute a ``successful conclusion'' to this war? Would it be the overthrow of Slobodan Milosevic and his government? Perhaps the removal of all Serbian troops from Kosovo and the subsequent return of all refugees to their homeland? Or would a successful conclusion to the war simply be forcing Milosevic to agree to the terms of the peace agreement which failed at Rambouillet? I, for one, do not feel this question has been sufficiently addressed, and I have a hunch that most, if not all of my colleagues would agree with this assessment. 
   Mr. President, even if we can agree to what would constitute a ``successful conclusion'' to the war, what else are we agreeing to? Surely the use of ground troops. But how many are we talking? 50,000? 100,000? 200,000? more? We have already committed our pilots to the conflict. But as to ground  troops--I think this is an issue which mandates a separate Senate debate specifically on this issue. We owe it to the American people, and we surely owe this to the troops whose lives lay in the balance of this decision. 
   What about the costs of this operation? I do not think we have a clue what this will cost--in lives or in dollars. We know that the President has requested somewhere in the realm of $6 billion, but the actual floor debate hasn't even begun and the figure is already fluctuating between $8 and 13 billion. 
   There is another matter about this resolution, and about this war, which troubles me greatly. When the military completed its Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), we were assured that our readiness state would allow us to successfully respond to two full scale wars at the same time. This would mean that although we are engaged in the air, and perhaps on the ground, in Kosovo, we would be ready to fight a full scale operation at the same time in another theater--the Korean Peninsula and Iraq come to mind as real possibilities. 
   Prior to the Kosovo operation, the Department of Defense assessed the risks associated with responding to a second major theater war as ``high.'' But now, because of our large commitment in the Balkans, and the fact that we are running dangerously low on cruise missiles and other munitions, our same military planners have changed this assessment to ``very high.'' If I understand this correctly, and I think I do, some of our own military strategists are concerned that our readiness is insufficient at this time to take on Milosevic and Saddam Hussein (Iraq) or Kim Jung-il (North Korea) at the same time. 
   Given this Administration's track record in dealing with Iraq and North Korea, I think we have a real problem on our hands. This is a catastrophe of virtually untellable proportions waiting to happen. 
   President Clinton has not asked the Congress for this blanket authorization on this war--and he continues to oppose the use of ground troops. While I strongly believe that it would be wrong for him to deploy ground troops absent clear Congressional authorization, I also do not believe that we should grant him this authority before he makes the request and the case for this authority. 
   On a final note, I want to congratulate Reverend Jesse Jackson for his efforts this past weekend, and convey my deep relief and pleasure that the three American soldiers were released and are now reunited with their families. 
   Mr. President, I support the motion to table, and urge my colleagues to do the same.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to honor the opening of the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage, Alaska. 
   The Heritage Center, the first of its kind in Alaska, is a twenty-six acre campus that offers a unique opportunity to learn and explore the traditional ways of Alaska Native cultures. The Center will be a ``gathering place'' where local residents and visitors to Alaska can meet Native Tradition Bearers, artists and performers. While visiting, they can learn about the Native traditional lifestyle by participating in workshops and guided tours of the five traditional village settings that have been built around a lake on the campus. 
   In 1994, I was privileged to add the Stevens/Murkowski Alaska Native Culture and Arts Development Act as an amendment to the School-to-Work Opportunities Act. This amendment paved the way for authorizing federal funding for the Alaska Native Heritage Center. Congressman DON YOUNG was instrumental in winning House approval for the measure. Over the past six years, Senator STEVENS has been successful in securing matching federal funds for the Center--I am proud to say the Center isn't just a federal project, but a statewide project funded by individuals, private companies, Native Corporations and friends from outside the State who were united in a common dream. 
   Finally, I would like to commend the vision and relentless dedication of the Chairman of the Alaska Native Heritage Center, Mr. Roy Huhndorf. The Heritage Center is a tribute to his leadership and determination to ensure a vibrant and continuing celebration of Alaska Native traditions and cultures for years to come.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator STEVENS in introducing legislation that will allow Alaska Native Corporations to establish settlement trusts designed to promote the health, education, welfare and cultural heritage of Alaska Natives. 
   Mr. President, in 1987, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act was  amended to permit Native Corporations to establish settlement trusts to hold lands and investments for the benefit of current and future generations of Alaska Natives. Assets in these trusts are insulated from business exposure and risks and can be invested to provide distributions of income to Native shareholders and their future generations. 
   Although the 1987 amendments were designed to facilitate the development of settlement trusts, many Native Corporations have been stymied in their efforts because the tax law, in many cases, imposes onerous penalties on the Native shareholders when the trusts are created. For example, when assets are transferred to the trust, they are treated as a de facto distribution of assets directly to the shareholders themselves to the extent of the corporation's earnings and profits. 
   Even though the current shareholders receive no actual income at the time of the transfer into the trust, they are liable for income taxes as if they received an actual distribution. This not only requires the shareholder to come up with money to pay taxes on a distribution he or she never received, but also can result in a situation where a trust fund beneficiary is required to prepay taxes on his share of the entire trust corpus, which may be substantially more in taxes than the amount of cash benefits he or she will actually receive in the future. 
   Our legislation remedies this inequity by requiring that a beneficiary of a settlement trust will be subject to taxation with respect to assets conveyed to the trust only when the actual distribution is received by the beneficiary. Moreover, the legislation provides that distributions from the trust will be taxable as ordinary income even if the distribution represents a return of capital. In addition, to ensure that these trusts do not accumulate excessive levels of the corporation's earnings, the legislation requires that the trust must annually distribute at least 55 percent of their taxable income. 
   Mr. President, Alaska Native Corporations are unique entities. Unlike Native American tribes in the lower 48, Alaska Native corporations are subject to income tax. But unlike ordinary C corporations, Alaska Native corporations have diverse purposes, one of which is to preserve and protect the heritage of the Native shareholders. The settlement trust concept is well suited to the special needs of Alaska's Natives. As the Conference Committee Report to ANSCA amendments of 1987 stated:  
   Trust distributions may be used to fight poverty, provide food, shelter and clothing and served comparable economic welfare purposes. Additionally, cash distributions of trust income may be made on an across-the-board basis to the beneficiary population as part of the economic welfare function.  
   Settlement trusts will ensure that for generations to come, Native Alaskans will have a steady stream of income on which to continue building an economic base. The current tax rules discourage the creation of such trusts with the result that Native corporations are under extreme pressure to distribute all current earnings rather than prudently reinvesting for the future. 
   Mr. President, it is my hope that we will be able to see this legislation adopted into law this year. For the long-term benefit of Alaska Natives, this tax law change is fundamentally necessary.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the seventh and eighth graders from Dzantik'i Henni Middle School. They are doing important work by educating the public on something that affects much of Alaska in the winter: Seasonal Affective Disorder or SAD. This disorder causes severe depression during the winter months in Alaska when there can be up to 24 hours of darkness in some places. 
   About one in three Alaskans suffer from mild to severe Seasonal Affective Disorder. Researchers suggest SAD may play a role in a variety of Alaska's social and medical problems, ranging from spousal abuse to alcoholism. 
   These incredible students, led by teacher Robert Traul Jones, developed a community health project to combat SAD. The project had two major goals. The first was to educate people about depression and its impact on northern communities and their residents. The second goal was to provide affordable treatment for this condition. The students did this by designing, marketing and building high-intensity light boxes, which they distributed to the surrounding communities. The light boxes combat the daily darkness outside with light therapy. 
   Their efforts were extraordinarily successful. The students projected 10 units being sold and ended up selling 39 units. The students are currently working with the Juneau Economic Development Commission to transfer their business to a local nonprofit organization. 
   Mr. President, it is with great pride that I recognize the achievements of these students. Their hard work and dedication is an inspiration to us all. These are the future leaders of our country and our single greatest resource. The seventh and eighth grade students from Dzantik'I Heeni Middle School should be proud of their achievements in combating SAD.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation cosponsored by Senator HAGEL, who is here, Senator BYRD, Senator CRAIG, Senator ROBERTS, Senator GRAMS, Senator HUTCHINSON, Senator ENZI, and, of course, Senator HAGEL. 
   This is a bill that deals with the issue of the potential climate change that we have heard so much about in this body over the last several months. 
   Our specific bill would do three things, Mr. President. First, the bill would create a new $2 billion research, development, and demonstration program designed to develop and enhance new technology to help stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. 
   This would be a cost-shared partnership with industry to spur innovation and technology so that we can use this technology and have it deployed in the United States, as well as have it exported around the world. Think about the tremendous advancements that have been made in technology in the last decade, Mr. President. Apply the same basis of need for that technology to be used to reduce greenhouse gases and address climate change. The necessity of doing this, Mr. President, is obvious. 
   We have seen discussed and examined the costs of Kyoto. The cost of complying with Kyoto is estimated to be up to $338 billion in lost gross domestic product by the year 2010. That equates to $3,068 per household by that year. So it is a substantial investment and deserves our attention now. 
   Our bill would improve the provisions in existing law which promote voluntary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Our emphasis remains on encouraging voluntary action and not creating new regulatory burdens. 
   Finally, our bill would establish greater accountability and responsibility for climate change and related matters within the Department of Energy by establishing a statutory office of global climate change. Somebody needs to be accountable in the Department of Energy for policies in this area. While the Secretary is ultimately accountable, we want to see greater program direction and focus in this area. It is justified, Mr. President, when we think of the costs associated with meeting the demands and requirements of Kyoto. We can do this and achieve this through technology, and it is an investment well spent. 
   Now, there are other commonsense approaches we continue to work on that we or others will later propose in separate bills or as amendments to this bill as we get into the debate. For example, we would like to protect the U.S. Global Climate Change Research Program from politics and ensure that it is conducting high-quality, merit-based, peer-reviewed science; we would like to remove regulatory obstacles that stand in the way of voluntary greenhouse gas emissions reduction; we would like to promote voluntary agricultural management practices that sequester, or trap, additional carbon dioxide in biomass and soils; we would like to promote forest management practices that sequester carbon. Mr. President, we encourage the growth of more trees. 
   We would like to promote U.S. exports of clean technologies to nations such as China and India, who are belching greenhouse gases and choking on their own pollutants. For this to be a global approach to a global issue, the developing countries must be engaged in the solution--unlike Kyoto, where there is a mandate that developing countries simply get a free ride. The recognition is--if you buy that logic--there is no net gain, no substantial decrease in emissions. Under our proposal, the technology would be applicable to the developing nations, so there would be a substantial net decrease in greenhouse gases. 
   Where sensible and cost effective, we would like to pursue possible changes to the Tax Code to promote certain activities or practices designed to reduce, sequester, or avoid greenhouse gas emissions. 
   These are all approaches that we plan to pursue, in a bipartisan manner, to address the issue of greenhouse gas emissions and potential climate change, because we believe the potential threat of human-induced climate change will best be solved on a global basis, and solved with technology and American innovation over the long term. 
   This is the reason we are engaging the developing nations to come aboard--by getting new technology into the marketplace, get it out there and installed and reduce emissions. 
   Compare our approach with that taken by the Kyoto protocol, which gives developing nations a free ride. 
   Kyoto explicitly ignores the provision of the Byrd-Hagel resolution, which passed this Senate 95 to 0 in 1997. 
   We are, of course, a body of advice and consent. We gave the administration our advice 95 to 0, so they shouldn't expect our consent. Ninety-five Senators, Mr. President, rarely agree on anything. As a consequence, I think we have spoken relative to the merits of the treaty that was brought before us. 
   Although the President may seek short-term political gain in simply signing a treaty that imposes burdens long after his watch is over--and that is the applicability of these targets--these targets will come long after the current administration is gone. So it is very easy to set these targets, because this administration won't be held accountable. If the President chooses to ignore our advice, then I don't think he should expect our consent. That is kind of where we are now. 
   If we recall the Byrd-Hagel resolution, it said that all nations must be included in emission targets and that serious economic harm must not result--serious economic harm. But what serious economic harm? Mr. President, I suggest that a cost to this Nation of $338 billion in lost GDP in the year 2010 is significant economic harm. 
   Yet the Kyoto proposal does not include all nations. Only 35 industrial nations are subject to emission limits, even though the 134 developing nations will surpass them in emissions by the year 2015. Moreover, the Kyoto protocol's regulatory approach requires legally binding quantified emissions reductions of 7 percent below 1990 levels by the years 2008-2012. That is roughly a 40-percent decrease in emissions from our current baseline. We simply can't get there from here without endangering energy supply, reliability, or our economy. 
   According to the economic analysis of the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration, if we were to adopt Kyoto, here is what American consumers could face in the year 2010:  
   53 percent higher gasoline prices; 
   86 percent higher electric prices; 
   Upward pressure on interest rates; 
   New inflationary pressures. 
   There goes your surplus. 
   At a recent hearing of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, one witness testified that the economic downturn accompanying the Kyoto implementation would depress tax revenues, erase the surplus we have earmarked to shore up Social Security, and reduce the public debt. 
   With the Kyoto approach, we say goodbye to the budget surplus, goodbye to the hopes of saving Social Security, and goodbye to the economic prosperity in this country today. 
   What do we get for enduring this economic pain? Do we stabilize the greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere under Kyoto? The answer is clearly no. Do we even reduce global greenhouse gas emissions? No, because any reductions by the 35 developed nations and the parties to the treaty would be overwhelmed by the growing emissions from the 134 nations that aren't covered by the Kyoto emissions limit. 
   That is what is wrong with Kyoto. Make no mistake about it, Mr. President, the Kyoto protocol is an expensive, short-term, narrowly applied regulatory approach that will erode U.S. sovereignty, punish U.S. consumers, and do nothing to enhance the global environment. 
   We are, with this bill and others that will follow, charting a different, a new, a progressive course. Ours is a long-term, technology-based, global effort. If human-induced greenhouse gas emissions are indeed changing the climate for the worse--and there remains substantial scientific uncertainty at this point--then we should act in a prudent manner to reduce, sequester, or avoid those emissions through technology. 
   I would like to address criticisms leveled by the administration about our bill that are based, I hope, on a misunderstanding. 
   A recent administration ``fact sheet,'' after recognizing that there are ``positive features'' in the bill, and noting that it ``makes improvements to current law'' regarding voluntary efforts to curtail emissions, goes on to incorrectly erroneously state that our bill ``rolls back energy efficiency and clean energy programs with a long history of bipartisan support.'' 
   The administration ``fact sheet'' is incorrect. Our bill does not roll back funding for renewable energy or energy efficiency. Instead, it authorizes $200 million per year in new money; it does not deauthorize any existing programs. 
   With that clarification, it would be my hope that the administration would support our bill and join us in a prudent, common sense approach to greenhouse gas emissions and climate. 
   Mr. President, I think I had 20 minutes under special orders this morning.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today, along with Mr. AKAKA, Mr. STEVENS, and Mr. INOUYE, I am introducing legislation that will provide a measure of relief to the citizens of Alaska and Hawaii who must rely on air transport far more than citizens in the lower 48. 
   When Congress adopted the balanced budget legislation in 1997, one of the provisions of the tax bill re-wrote the formula for calculating the air passenger tax for domestic and international flights. As part of this formula change, Congress adopted a per passenger, per segment fee which disproportionately penalizes travelers to and from Alaska and Hawaii who have no choice but to travel by air. 
   The legislation we are introducing today would reinstate the prior law 10 percent tax formula for flights to and from our states. In addition, the $6 international departure fees that are imposed on such flights would be retained at the current level and would not be indexed. I see no reason why passengers flying to and from our states must face a guaranteed increase in tax every year because of inflation. We don't index tobacco taxes, we don't index fuel taxes; why should government automatically gain additional revenue from air passengers simply because of inflation? 
   Mr. President, this legislation requires that intrastate Alaska and Hawaii flights will be subject to a flat 10 percent tax if such flights do not originate or terminate at a rural airport in our states. In addition, the definition of a rural airport is expanded to include airports within 75 miles of each other where no roads connect the communities. This provision not only benefits Alaska, but many island communities throughout the United States. In many towns in Alaska, air transport is the only viable means of transportation from one community to another. There is no reason these airports should be denied the benefit of the special rural airport tax rate simply because our state does not have the transportation infrastructure or geographic definition that exists in most of the lower 48.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss certain aspects of our military campaign in Kosovo that deeply trouble me. 
   We are now into the fourth week of the NATO bombing campaign, and so far things are far worse for the Albanian Kosovars who have been systematically uprooted from their homes and either killed or driven into exile in neighboring countries. Many of their homes have been burned to the ground. Whole villages have been destroyed, with the result that hundreds of thousands of people have become refugees with no worldly possessions except what they could carry on their backs. 
   On March 23, on the eve of NATO's bombing campaign, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright stated that there was a specific purpose, and that was to:  
   Deter Slobodan Milosevic from continuing on this rampage and going in and torching--having his soldiers and special police torch the villages. So it is designed to deter that, and also to damage his capability to do that.  
   Well, less than 4 weeks later, it is clear that Secretary Albright and the Administration seem to have misjudged Milosevic. NATO bombing has in no way deterred the torching and ethnic cleansing. It has, in fact, intensified since the bombing began. There can be no doubt that if, as Secretary Albright stated, our goal was to deter the rampage against the ethnic Albanians, our policy has failed. 
   When it became apparent to the Administration that its policy of protecting the Albanian Kosovars had failed, the Administration in early April shifted the message and claimed that the bombing was designed to ``degrade'' Serbia's military capacity. However, we appear to be doing this indirectly in that our bombs and cruise  missiles have been targeting infrastructure, specifically bridges, oil refineries, rail lines, and telecommunications, rather than hitting tanks, heavy guns and, of course, the troops. 
   Despite the massive air campaign, the Serbs' ability to wage war on Kosovo continues unabated. Fuel for the Serbian war machine flows through Montenegro, whose ports are filled with tankers. Although we have sought to blockade the ports, our allies, primarily the French, have blocked that effort for fear of widening the conflict. 
   What greatly concerns me, however, is that while the Serbian war machine continues to roll south unimpeded, it is the American military that has been substantially degraded by the shortsighted policies of the Clinton administration. 
   When NATO bombing began, the military fired between 30 and 50 air-launched cruise missiles targeted primarily against Serbian air defenses. The air-launched cruise missiles are a critical element in our military because they can be fired hundreds of miles away from heavily guarded targets without directly risking pilots and other air personnel. In addition, since they rely on global positioning satellites for navigation, they can hit their targets in both good and bad weather. 
   Unfortunately, there is a crucial shortage of cruise missiles because the Administration has had a propensity to use them for some dubious purposes in the past. In the short 4-day bombing that occurred in Iraq, Operation Desert Fox, the United States used 90 air-launched cruise missiles. We fired an additional barrage of cruise missiles against Sudan and Afghanistan last summer. In both instances, it is not clear that we achieved any policy objectives beyond using up a large percentage of our arsenal of cruise missiles. 
   Now, what is truly astonishing is that today the United States is not, and I emphasize not, producing a single cruise missile. There is not a single production line operating that is manufacturing or refitting cruise missiles to replace the missiles in our arsenal. 
   Today there are only 90 to 100--that's right--90 to 100 air-launched cruise missiles in our inventory. They apparently won't be replaced any time soon. 
   Because of operations in Kosovo, the Office of Management and Budget has requested $51 million to convert 92 nuclear-tipped cruise missiles into conventional cruise missiles. That is what it cost--almost a half million dollars each for that conversion. However, the first converted cruise missile would not be available for at least 7 months, by November at the earliest. If the production line for new air-launched cruise missiles was reopened at Boeing, it would take several million dollars of commitment and funding simply to restart it. Even if that happened, the line would not even begin producing new missiles for more than a year. 
   Why have the cruise missile production lines closed? The answer appears to be that a new generation of air-launched cruise missiles will be added to the Air Force's inventory, and the military hence decided it no longer needed to add to its current inventory. However, the new generation of missiles will not be available before 2001 or 2002 at the earliest. 
   Given President Clinton's propensity to fire off cruise missiles apparently at whim, and given Secretary Albright's blustery rhetoric, we wonder if anyone in the Administration in recent years gave consideration in advance to reopening the closed production lines to allow us to rebuild our inventory before we began the air campaign in Yugoslavia. Or did they believe that diplomatic bluster from the State Department would convince adversaries that military confrontations would not happen until our new generation cruise missiles were on line in 3 to 4 years? 
   A similar, but less dangerous, scenario exists with the Navy cruise missile, the Tomahawk. During the past 10 years, we have had approximately 2,500 Tomahawks in our inventory. That number is down considerably--down to about 2,000 since we used 330 during the 4-day bombing in Operation Desert Fox and 150 by the Navy so far in Kosovo. As in the case with the Air Force, the Tomahawk production line has also been shut down because a new generation of missiles will be produced. However, again that missile production will not be available before the year 2003. 
   By one estimate, the cost of restarting the Tomahawk production line would be $40 million, and it would take 2 1/2 years before a missile, a single missile, would come off that line. Clearly, this is not an option. Although the Navy is seeking $113 million to remanufacture 324 older model Tomahawks, those will not be available in the foreseeable future. 
   Mr. President, there are very strong indications that if nothing changes, the bombing campaign in Yugoslavia could last through the summer. Quite frankly, I do not believe that anyone in the Administration really knows how long this campaign is going to continue. But so long as the air campaign continues, the shortage of cruise missiles means that it is our pilots who will have to take greater risks and they will be subjected to those risks. 
   It is our pilots who will have to hit the facilities that cruise missiles could have hit. They will have to deal with the surface-to-air missiles and ground fire that have a minimal impact on the unmanned cruise missiles. They will have to deal with the vagaries of the weather, something that does not affect the capabilities of our cruise missiles. 
   Moreover, we have many responsibilities and vital interests in other areas throughout the world. What would happen if Saddam Hussein began posing threats to Kuwait again? What would happen with regard to threats that we have seen regularly coming from North Korea? A recent article in the Washington Post quoted Russian analysts who have been interviewed from time to time and have picked up sensitive material advising us of the North Korean officials and their continued threat. North Korean officials have indicated that the NATO bombing has had a sufficient impact on their Government that could lead to further upgrades of its missile and military capability. 
   Clearly, the severe shortage of cruise missiles diminishes 
   some of our military options and surely makes the world a more dangerous place. 
   But the shortage of cruise missiles also reflects on the shortsightedness and overcommitments made by the Administration over the last few years. At the same time that this Administration was committing us to military interventions of some dubious purposes, they have been cutting military spending. They have shortchanged our military readiness because they have been unwilling to sacrifice domestic spending and provide our troops with the necessary means to carry out our military objectives, and particularly to have an adequate inventory. 
   Now that we are engaged in this very serious mission in Kosovo, the shortfalls in our military spending are becoming dangerously obvious. I believe it is incumbent on the Administration and Congress to realistically assess the state of our military readiness and to provide the appropriate funds to maintain that we, indeed, have a technological support base for our troops and adequate inventories of cruise missiles and other military armaments. 
   At the same time, we need to have a real debate about the goals in this conflict in Yugoslavia and our strategy to achieve those goals. I fear the Administration completely miscalculated when it launched the air campaign. It is my view that they thought the air campaign would be a short campaign. I believe they assumed that the Serbs would immediately retreat when the bombs began to descend and that the Serbs would passively accept Secretary Albright's demand that NATO troops be positioned in Kosovo. 
   That has not happened. And now the question is, What is next? Why are we to assume that if bombing had not worked in this last 4 weeks, that another 4 weeks or another 4 months of bombing will change anything on the ground? History suggests that bombing by itself tends to steel the will of the people who are under assault. Why would the Serbian people react any differently than the people of London, who endured far harsher bombings by the Nazis and still never gave in? 
   Mr. President, it has been said that when it comes to the Balkans, there are no good options. What is clear to me is that even if the refugees would somehow be allowed to return to Kosovo, a very large occupation force on the ground, including Americans,  would be needed to maintain any semblance of peace, and that force would be required to stay not for months but for years, and perhaps decades. 
   This is not an outcome I can support. We were told by the President that we were only going to be in Bosnia for 1 year. Four years later, we are still there and there is little sign that Bosnian peace can survive without a military presence to maintain that peace. 
   I think it was shortsighted of the Administration to allow cruise missile production to end and to initiate a conflict without an adequate inventory. That same shortsightedness marks our foreign policy. And the result today is that we are engaged in a conflict, with NATO's credibility on the line. 
   I believe the only solution to the crisis in Kosovo is to re-engage the Serbs in diplomatic negotiations. Most importantly, we need to recognize that the ethnic conflicts in the Balkans have a long history and the people living there may never live in peace so long as the borders are drawn as they are today. Unfortunate as this may be, it may ultimately become necessary to redraw some of those borders in the Balkans to reflect political and ethnic realities. 
   Mr. President, I came across an article written by David Greenberg. Mr. Greenberg writes the History Lesson column for Slate and is a Richard Hofstadter fellow in American history at Columbia University. 
   This particular article poses the question, What solution does history dictate for Kosovo? 
   I thought it an excellent treaty on the history and background. Knowing the Presiding Officer's familiarity with this particular subject, I will read this article into the RECORD at this time. 
   Mr. Greenberg writes:  
   Ever since the United States began contemplating doing something about war and ethnic cleansing in the collapsing state of Yugoslavia in 1991, all sides have invoked history as a guide to action. Those who opposed involvement in Bosnia in the early '90s--and who doubt that NATO can bring peace to Kosovo today--argue that the long record of intractable ethnic tension among the Balkan peoples means we should stay out. Any settlement, they say, is doomed to be temporary. Robert Kaplan's book ``Balkan Ghosts,'' which advances this thesis regarding Bosnia, reportedly convinced President Clinton to steer clear of military action there for a time. 
   Interventionists also invoke history. They note the longstanding claim of ethnic Albanians to the territory of Kosovo dating back to 1200 B.C., when the Albanians' supposed ancestors, the Illyrians, settled there. This ancient history forms the basis of demands for self-determination on the part of the long-suffering Albanian Kosovars. But the Serbs, too, stake a historical claim. Their Slavic forebears migrated to Kosovo around A.D. 500, and they contend that Serbs have lived there ever since. 
   In fact, each of these assertions is subject to qualification, as is made clear in Noel Malcolm's masterly (but misnamed) ``Kosovo: A Short History'' (my main source along with Hugh Poulton's ``The Balkans: Minorities and States in Conflict''). The tie of today's Albanian Kosovars to the ancient Illyrians is fairly attenuated. And while Slavs did move into the area around 500, when the Bulgarian Empire conquered the Balkans, the Serbs didn't gain control of Kosovo until the 12th century, when a dynasty of their leaders known as the Nemanjids invaded it after a period of Byzantine rule. 
   For two centuries the Nemanjids basked in their Balkan kingdom. Serb nationalists today are fond of noting that in 1389 it was in Kosovo that the Serbian Prince Lazar and his armies made their last stand against the invading Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Kosovo. They're less likely to note that the Albanians of Kosovo fought alongside them. (Explicit references to the Albanian people as opposed to the Illyrians begin to appear around the 11th century.) 
   During Turkey's 500-year rule, most of Kosovo's Albanians--and Albania's Albanians, also subjects of the Ottoman Empire--converted to Islam. The Serbs remained Orthodox Christians. That may be one reason that the Serbs sought independence first. In 1804 they rose up and in 1828 broke free. Kosovo, however, remained largely content under Turkish rule. Serbs, believing that Kosovo still rightfully belonged to them, did briefly conquer it in 1877 when, along with Russia, the new Serbian state made war on Turkey. But under the Russian-Ottoman armistice a year later, Serbia was forced to withdraw. 
   At this point, the Albanians--of both Kosovo and Albania proper--commenced their so-called ``national awakening.'' A group called the League of Prizren, named for the Kosovo town where it met, lobbied for autonomy within the Ottoman Empire. A generation later, this movement flowered into insurrection, as Albanians throughout the western pocket of the Balkans revolted. Albania secured statehood in 1912, but before the status of Kosovo could be resolved, the entire region was rocked, in quick succession by the First Balkan War (1912), the Second Balkan War (1913) and, for good measure, World War I (1914-18). 
   First to invade Kosovo in these years were the Serbs. The Serbs were knocked out by the Austrians, who were knocked out by the French. The French handed the province back to their allies the Serbs. After the war, the Allies, following Wilsonian ideals of self-determination, straightened up Europe into tidy nation-states. With minimal thought on the part of the mapmakers, Kosovo was folded into Serbia, which joined five neighboring Balkan territories to form the new state of Yugoslavia. Albania appealed to the Allies for control of Kosovo but, considered an insignificant state, was rebuffed in deference to Serbian claims. 
   As the largest republic in the multinational state, Serbia dominated Yugoslavia. Its capital of Belgrade, for example, was the nation's capital too. Under Serbian rule, Kosovo again became a battleground. 
   In the late 19th century, Serbian nationalists had built up national myths about the heroics of Prince Lazar and cast Kosovo's status as a Jerusalem-like holy land populated with Orthodox religious shrines. Throughout the 1920s and '30s, the central government in Belgrade pushed Albanians out of the region and moved Serbs in--efforts the Albanian majority resisted, often to their peril. 
   In World War II, Kosovo again resembled Europe's Grand Central Station. The Axis powers rolled in and carved up the region: Albania's Fascist government, headed by a puppet of Mussolini's, seized the biggest chunk, while Bulgaria and Germany each occupied a strip. Communist partisans retook the province in 1944, and when the war ended, the partisan leader Josip Broz Tito became dictator of the reconstituted Yugoslav federation. The Communists considered ceding Kosovo to Albania but instead decided that it should revert to its antebellum status quo. They deemed Kosovo not an autonomous republic but a province of Serbia. 
   In the name of Yugoslav unity, Tito suppressed most assertions of ethnic identity. He jailed or killed thousands of Albanian Kosovars and banned Albanian-language publications. But he was, to some degree, an equal opportunity tyrant: He also halted Serbian efforts to settle Kosovo. In 1968, with uprisings sweeping the globe, student protests triggered a wave of demands for greater Kosovar autonomy. Tito acceded to a series of reforms, culminating in a new Yugoslav Constitution in 1974, which gave Kosovo control over much of its internal affairs. That year marked the high point for Kosovar aspirations to independence, and it remains the benchmark for NATO's demand at Rambouillet for a restoration of Kosovo's ``pre-1989'' autonomy. 
   Tito died in 1980. The next year, Albanian Kosovar students erupted again, with some Kosovars clamoring for republichood. Belgrade, no longer restrained by Tito's aversion to exacerbating ethnic conflict, cracked down. Polarization followed: Slobodan Milosevic--first as a Communist and then as a Serbian nationalist--whipped up anti-Albanian sentiment. In 1989, he stripped Kosovo of its cherished autonomy. Meanwhile, Albanian Kosovars proclaimed their territory a republic and, through channels violent and nonviolent, sought actual independence. Unrelenting, Milosevic undertook the massacres of the last year, which finally precipitated NATO's bombing. 
   That, in a nutshell, is the history of Kosovo. If you can find a solution to today's mess in there, let me know. Take a snapshot at 1200 B.C. and the Albanians can claim it; look at A.D. 1200 and it's a Serbian kingdom. The United States prefers to use the 1974 benchmark. Milosevic points to 1989. But even at those points, the snapshot looks pretty blurry. 
   Before NATO began bombing Yugoslavia March 24, the proposed Rambouillet solution--restoring Kosovo's autonomy but not granting it independence--seemed like a plausible outcome. Now it's hard to imagine Kosovars accepting any kind of Serbian rule. If victorious, NATO may grant Kosovo independence or perhaps divide it up. History won't decide Kosovo's fate. Our actions in the weeks ahead will decide history. 
   I bring this to the attention of my colleagues simply to highlight a little history and point to the complexities in reaching a resolution to this very difficult foreign policy question. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to honor students from my home State of Alaska who have garnered a host of honors recently--all very well deserved. 
   As an avid outdoorsman and hunter I have more than passing skill with a rifle, but I am in awe at the accomplishments of the University of Alaska Fairbanks Rifle Team. On Friday, March 12 the team won the NCAA national title in team rifle competition during the annual championships held at Norwich University in Northfield, VT. 
   While the Nanooks won the team Rifle Championships, the students had several other firsts. Ms. Kelly Mansfield, a junior at the University, became the first person ever to win both the small-bore and individual titles in the same year. And the Nanooks set a record with eight team members earning All-American status, record number of All-Americans in rifle competition from a single University. Of the team's eight All-Americans six earned honors in both the small-bore and air rifle disciplines, another record. 
   Besides Ms. Mansfield, I would like to congratulate the other seven All-Americans who competed with such distinction during the national collegiate championships. Earning praise are sophomore Dan Jordan, freshman Johan Lindberg and sophomore Melissa Mulloy, all double All-Americans first team in both events. Also earning praise are junior Joacim Trybom, who earned first-team, small-bore and second team air rifle honors; Grant Mecozzi, who earned second-team honors in both categories; and Amber Darland, who made the second team in small-bore. 
   I also would like to mention senior Kelly Bushong, who won honorable mention on the small-bore squad. 
   All of the students from the University's Fairbanks campus performed wonderfully, an obvious reflection on their coach, Randy Pitney, who has done a sensational job of teaching and preparing his team this year. All Alaskans wish to offer our praise and our thanks for the team's hard work and dedication. Excellence in marksmanship takes skill and discipline. It also takes desire--the desire to practice, the desire to be the best. That was particularly hard this past January in Fairbanks when the temperature was often -50 degrees F. 
   I can't say enough for the accomplishments of these young women and men. Everyone in Alaska is very proud of the Nanooks' achievements during the 1998-99 season. Again, congratulations on a great year.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and Senator STEVENS to introduce legislation that would resolve a dispute that has existed for several years between the IRS and native whaling captains in my state. Our legislation would amend the Internal Revenue Code to ensure that a charitable donation tax deduction would be allowed for native whaling captains who organize and support subsistence whaling activities in their communities. 
   Substence whaling is a necessity to the Alaska Native community. In many of our remote village communities, the whale hunt is a tradition that has been carried on for generations over many millennia. It is the custom that the captain of the hunt make all provisions for the meals, wages and equipment costs associated with this important activity. 
   In most instances, the Captain is repaid in whale meat and muktuck, which is blubber and skin. However, as part of the tradition, the Captain is required to donate a substantial portion of the whale to his village in order to help the community survive. 
   The proposed deduction would allow the Captain to deduct up to $7,500 to help defray the costs associated with providing this community service. 
   Mr. President, I want to point out that if the Captain incurred all of these expenses and then donated the whale meat to a local charitable organization, the Captain would almost certainly be able to deduct the costs he incurred in outfitting the boat for the charitable purpose. However, the cultural significance of the Captain's sharing the whale with the community would be lost. 
   This is a very modest effort to allow the Congress to recognize the importance of this part of our Native Alaskan tradition. When this measure passed the senate two years ago, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that this provision would cost a mere three million dollars over a 10 year period. I think that is a very small price for preserving this vital link with our natives' heritage.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senator TED STEVENS in introducing legislation that would clarify a provision in the tax code that exempts the State of Alaska from the IRS diesel dyeing rules. 
   The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 included a provision that exempted Alaska from the diesel dyeing requirements during the period the state was exempted from the Clean Air Act low sulfur diesel dyeing rules. For various reasons, it was believed at the time that Alaska would ultimately be permanently exempted from the Clean Air Act rules. However, technological changes suggest that Alaska may in the next few years lose its exemption from the low sulfur rules. 
   However, in our view, whether Alaska is exempted from the low sulfur rules, it is imperative that Alaska be permanently exempted from the IRS diesel dyeing rules. That is what our bill does. 
   Today, more than 95 percent of all diesel fuel used in Alaska is exempt from tax because it is used for heating, power generation, or in commercial fishing boats. Under the diesel dyeing rules in place in 49 states, exempt diesel must be dyed. If these diesel dyeing rules were applied to Alaska, refiners would have to buy huge quantities of dye, along with expensive injection systems, to dye all of this non-taxable diesel fuel. 
   Although the Joint Tax Committee originally estimated in 1996 that repealing the dyeing rules for Alaska could cost the Treasury $500,000 a year, some refiners were spending as much as $750,000 on dye alone. Add on another $100,000 for injection systems and you begin to wonder what happened to common sense regulation. Congress saw it that way and decided to exempt Alaska. Now that exemption should be made permanent. 
   Approximately 65 percent of the state's communities are served solely by barges. For many of these communities, the fuel oil barge comes in only once a year when the waterways are not frozen. It is absurd to require these communities to build a second storage facility for undyed taxable fuel simply for the few vehicles in town that are subject to tax. 
   It is currently projected that the state will have to spend from $200 million to $400 million just to repair fuel storage tanks in hundreds of rural communities because of leaking fuel problems. If IRS dyeing rules were in place, millions more would have to be spent simply to maintain a small supply of taxable diesel in each of these communities. 
   Mr. President, in 1996, Congress acted sensibly in exempting Alaska from the IRS diesel dyeing rules. It is my hope that we will again see the wisdom of exempting Alaska, this time making it a permanent exemption.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon in support of the National Monument Public Participation Act of 1999. This legislation puts the ``Public'' back into public land management and the ``Environment'' back into environmental protection. 
   Passage of this Act will insure that all the gains we have made over the past quarter century in creating an open participatory government which affords strong environmental protection for our public lands are protected. 
   For those of you who thought those battles were fought and ``won'' with the passage of National Environmental Protection Act in 1969, the Federal Land Policy Management Act in 1976, and the National Forest Management Act of 1976, I have bad news. There is one last battle to be fought. 
   Standing in this very Chamber on January 30, 1975, Senator Henry M. ``Scoop'' Jackson spoke to the passion Americans feel for their public lands. He said:  
   The public lands of the United States have always provided the arena in which we American's have struggled to fulfill our dreams. Even today dreams of wealth, adventure, and escape are still being acted out on these far flung lands. These lands and the dreams--fulfilled and unfulfilled--which they foster are a part of our national destiny. They belong to all Americans.  
   Amazingly, there exists today ``legal'' authorities by which the President, without public process or Congressional approval and without any environmental review, can create vast special management units. Special management units which can affect how millions of acres of our public lands are managed, what people can do on these lands, and what the future will be for surrounding communities. 
   This is a powerful trust to bestow upon anyone--even a President. 
   On September 12, 1996, the good people of Utah woke up to find themselves the most recent recipient of a philosophy that says: ``Trust us we're from the federal government, and we know what's best for you''. On that day, standing in the State of Arizona, the President invoked the 1906 Antiquities Act to create a 1.7 million acre Nation Monument in Southern Utah. By using this antiquated law the President was able to avoid this nation's environmental laws and ignore public participation laws. With one swipe of the pen, every shred of public input and environmental law promulgated in this country over the past quarter of a century was shoved into the trash heap of political expediency. 
   What happened in Utah is but the latest example of a small cadre of Administration officials deciding for all Americans how our public lands should be used. It is a classic example of a backroom deal, catering to special interests at the expense of the public. It is by no means the only one. 
   As a Senator from Alaska, I have a great deal of personal experience in this area. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter used this law to create ``17'' National Monuments in Alaska covering more than 55 millions acres of land. This was followed in short order by this Secretary of the Interior Cecil Andrus who withdrew an additional 50 million acres. All this land was withdrawn from multiple uses without any input from the people of Alaska, the public, or the Congress of the United States. All this occurred while Congress was considering legislation affecting these lands, while Congress was conducting workshops throughout Alaska and holding hearings in Washington, DC to involve the public. 
   With over 100 million acres of withdrawn land held over Alaska's head like the sword of Damocles, we were forced to cut the best deal we could. Twenty years later the people of my state are still struggling to cope with the weight of these decisions. President Carter cut his deal for his special interests to avoid the public debate on legislation, just as President Clinton did with the Grand Staircase/Escalante. 
   I would not be here this afternoon if the public, and Congress were not systematically being denied a voice in the creation of National Monuments. I would not be here if environmental procedures were being followed. But the people of this nation are being denied the opportunity to speak, Congress is being denied its opportunity to participate, and environmental procedure are being ignored. The only voice we hear is that of the President. Without bothering to ask what we thought about it, he told the citizens of Utah and the rest of the country that he knew better than they what was best for them. 
   It has been a long time since anyone has had the right to make those kinds of unilateral public land use decisions for the American public. Since passage of the Forest Service Organic Act and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act in 1976 we have had a rock hard system of law on how public land use decisions are to be made. Embodied within these laws are public participation. Agencies propose an action, they present that action to the public, the public debates the issue, bad decisions can be appealed, the courts resolve disputes, and finally the management unit is created. Where was this public participation in the special use designation of 1.7 million acres of federal land in southern Utah? 
   Since the passage of the National Environmental Policy Act in 1969 activities which effect the environment are subject to strict environmental reviews. Does anyone believe there is no environmental threat posed by the creation of a national monument? 
   The economic and social consequences of this decision will have enormous and irrevocable impacts not only on the land immediately affected, but on surrounding lands and communities. All these effects on the human environment would have been evaluated under the land management statutes and the environmental procedural review. Where is the NEPA compliance documentation associated with this action? 
   The Constitutions explicitly provides that ``The Congress shall have the power to dispose of, and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States.'' The creation of specialized public use designations such as National Parks and Wilderness Areas are debated within the Halls of Congress. These Debates provide for the financial and legal responsibilities which come with the creation of special management units. Where are the proceedings from those debates? 
   They simply do not exist because, in the heat of political expediency, the Administration determined that public process, environmental analyses, and Congressional deliberations were a waste of time. 
   Mr. President, either you believe in public process or you do not, you can't have it both ways. We can no longer trust the Administration to involve the public in major land use decisions and we can no longer tolerate the blanket evasion of the laws designed to protect our natural resources. The time has come for Congress to reassert its Constitutional responsibility under Article IV. 
   The legislation which Senator CRAIG and I offer today will require that any future designations of National Monuments to follow the public participation principals laid down in law over the past 25 years. 
   No poetic images, no flowery words, no smoke and mirrors, no special coverage on Good Morning America, just good old fashion public land management process. 
   Before these special land management units can be created, our legislation will require that agencies gather and analyze resource data affected by these land use decisions; that full public participation in the designation of  the units takes place (with all appeal rights protected); that there be compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act; and that Congress review and approve final designation. No longer will an administration be able to side-step public participation and environmental reviews to further its political agenda and cater to special interest. 
   Nobody--not even the President--should be above the law. The National Monument Participation Act will make all future land use decisions a joint responsibility of the public through the Congress, that they elect. This legislation reasserts the Constitutional role of the Congress in public land decisions. 
   I do not question the need for National Monuments. If the national benefit can be demonstrated, then by all means a national monument should be created. But, if they are to serve the common good, they must be created under the same system of land management law that has managed the use of the public domain for the past 25 years and pursuant to the document that has governed this Nation for the past 225 years. 
   There has always been a sacred bond between the American people and the lands they hold in common ownership. No one-regardless of high station or political influence--has the right to impose his will over the means by which the destiny of those land is decided. 
   This legislation re-establishes that bond.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, trails are one of America's most popular recreational resources. Millions of Americans hike, ski, jog, bike, ride horses, drive snow machines and all-terrain vehicles, observe nature, commute, and relax on trails throughout the country. A variety of trails are provided nationwide, including urban bike paths, bridle paths, community green ways, historic trails, motorized trails, and long distance hiking trails. 
   The American Discovery Trail, or ADT, will be established by this legislation. The ADT is being proposed as a continuous, coast to coast trail to link the nation's principal north-south trails and east-west historic trails with shorter local and regional trails into a nationwide network. 
   By establishing a system of Discovery Trails, this new category will recognize that using and enjoying trails close to home is equally as important as traversing remote wilderness trails. Long-distance trails are used mostly by people living close to the trail and by week-end'ers. Backpacking excursions are normally a few days to a couple of weeks. For example, of the estimated four million users of the Appalachian Trail each year, only about 100 to 150 walk the entire trail annually. This will be true of the American Discovery Trail as well, especially because of it proximity to urban locations throughout the country. 
   The ADT, the first of the Discovery Trails, will connect six of the national scenic trails, 10 of the national historic trails, 23 of the national recreational trails and hundreds of other local and regional trails. Until now, the element that has been missing in order to create a national system of ``connected'' trails is that the existing trails for the most part are not connected. 
   The ADT is about access. The trail will connect people to large cities, small towns and urban areas and to mountains, forest, desert and natural areas by incorporating local, regional and national trails together.  
   What makes the ADT so exciting is the way it has already brought people together. More than 100 organizations along the trail's 6,000 miles support the effort. Each state the trail passes through already has a volunteer coordinator who leads an active ADT committee. This strong grassroots effort, along with financial support from Backpacker magazine, Eco USA, The Coleman Company and others have helped take the ADT from dream to reality. 
   Only one more very important step on the trail needs to be taken. Congress needs to authorize the trail as part of our National Trails System. 
   The American Discovery Trail begins (or ends) with your two feet in the Pacific Ocean at Point Reyes National Seashore, just north of San Francisco. Next are Berkeley and Sacramento before the climb to the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail and Lake Tahoe, in the middle of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. 
   Nevada will offer Historic Virginia City, home of the Comstock Lode, the Pony Express National Historic Trail, Great Basin National Park with Lehman Caves and Wheeler Peak. 
   Utah will provide National Forests and Parks along with spectacular red rock country, until you get to Colorado and Colorado National Monument and its 20,445 acres of sandstone monoliths and canyons. Then there's Grand Mesa over Scofield Pass, and Crested Butte, in the heart of ski country as you follow the Colorado and Continental Divide Trails into Evergreen. 
   At Denver the ADT divides and becomes the Northern and Southern Midwest routes. The Northern Midwest Route winds through Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. The Southern Midwest Route leaves Colorado and the Air Force Academy and follows the tracks and wagon wheel ruts of thousands of early pioneers through Kansas and Missouri as well as settlements and historic places in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky until the trail joins the Northern route in Cincinnati. 
   West Virginia is next, then Maryland to the C&O Canal into Washington D.C. The Trail passes the Mall, the White House, the Capitol, and then heads on to Annapolis. Finally, in Delaware, the ADT reaches its eastern terminus at Cape Henlopen State Park and the Atlantic Ocean. 
   Between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans one will experience some of the most spectacular scenery in the world, thousands of historic sites, lakes, rivers and streams of every size. The trail offers an opportunity to discover America from small towns, to rural countryside, to large metropolitan areas, 
   When the President signs this legislation into law, a twelve year effort will have been achieved--the American Discovery Trail will have become a reality. The more people who use it, the better.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an amendment to the Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 to provide Indian Tribal Trust fund beneficiaries the option of having their trust funds managed according to their wishes, which could add measurably to the value of their trust funds. For individual Indian trust fund beneficiaries, the legislation would allow them to earn greater returns through government-regulated trust departments than allowed by current law. 
   This bill is an outgrowth of a joint hearing held March 3rd of this year by the Senate Committees on Indian Affairs and Energy & Natural Resources to investigate the Department of Interior's efforts to reform the trust management systems for individual Indians and Indian Tribes. 
   The Secretary of the Interior, on behalf of the U.S. government, acts as the trustee for some 1,500 tribal trust funds for 338 Indian tribes with assets of $2.6 billion. He performs a similar service for 300,000 individual Indian accounts totaling some $500 million. For well over 100 years, these accounts have been in severe disarray, and in my mind, recent reform efforts under the Indian Trust Fund Management Act show few tangible signs of improvement. 
   Funds are unaccounted for, paperwork is missing, and Indians are uncertain about the accuracy of the amounts reported in their trust accounts. Recent newspaper reports tell of an ongoing inability or unwillingness on the part of the Departments of the Interior and Treasury to comply with requests from the U.S. District Court to produce documents relating to a small number of trust accounts. The Chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Senator BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL, has shown an unflagging commitment to ensure that the Indian trust fund debacle is cleaned up and put upon a sound footing for the Indian beneficiaries whose only sin has been to trust the word of the Federal Government. 
   While I look forward to working with Chairman CAMPBELL on his efforts to compel the Department of the Interior to institute the reforms necessary to come to grips with the ongoing problems of the Indian trust fund management, this bill is not designed to tackle that daunting task. 
   This will would grant Indian Tribes the option of having their funds treated the same way trust beneficiaries' funds are treated by prudent bank trust departments throughout this nation. Presently, federal law prohibits the Office of Trust Management from investing Indian trust funds in anything other than government-guaranteed instruments. This severely limits the rate of return Indians receive, to the point that they receive the lowest rate of return of any trust beneficiaries in the country. 
   Virtually all other trust funds in the country are managed under the ``prudent investor'' rule, which, when coupled with government regulation of trust departments, ensures that trust funds are managed conservatively but wisely for the long term best interests of the trust beneficiary. 
   The express prohibition against investment of Indian trust funds in all but government-guaranteed instruments has a dual effect on America's first--and poorest--residents. First, it restricts the growth of their trust funds. Second, it means that Indian trust funds will not be available for investment in Indian Country. 
   Under my proposal, the Secretary of the Interior, working with the Comptroller of the Currency, would contract with qualified financial institutions that are regulated by a federal bank regulatory agency for the investment of funds managed for Indian Tribes and individuals. Tribes would still have the option of keeping their money in government-guaranteed low-yield instruments if they so choose. 
   Those funds invested with government-regulated trust institutions would be managed according to the prudent investor rules governing all other trusts throughout the country. The U.S. government would still act as the guarantor of those funds through its regulatory and enforcement mechanisms. Because stated balances of trust funds may not be accurate due to historical mismanagement, the legislation is intended to ensure that if Indian trust funds are managed by private financial institutions, possible claims against the government for accurate balances are not extinguished. 
   Moreover, the Secretary would be directed, in the selection of a qualified financial institution, to comply with the Buy-Indian Act (25 U.S.C. 47). This would mean that if qualified Indian-owned financial institutions were properly regulated and certified, investment of Indian trust funds could act as investment capital for expanding economic opportunities in Indian country. 
   It is my hope that through the successful implementation of this legislation, we will see Indian people finally getting a fair return on their dollars, which might very well be generated from new enterprises via investments of their own monies. The American dream should not be allowed to be continued to be denied to the First Americans. 
   Mr. President, the Secretary of the Interior, is not an investment banker. There are a variety of things that the federal government does not do well, and the management of trust funds is one of them. We have financial institutions that are regulated and who have the experience of managing large trust funds. We have a large body of law governing the fiduciary responsibility of trustees. It is long past time for the Secretary to focus on the accounting of receipts and let those who know something about investments handle the actual management of these trust funds.  The present situation simply perpetuates the cycle of dependence for too many tribes and denies them the same reasonable expectation of return that all non-Indian trust beneficiaries have a right to expect.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the University of Alaska (the University) is Alaska's oldest post-secondary school. The University was chartered prior to statehood and has played a vital role in educating Alaskans as well as students from around the world in the United States' only arctic and sub-arctic environment. Additionally, the University has served as an important  cornerstone in Alaska's history. For example, the University housed the Alaska Constitutional Convention where the fathers of statehood carved out the rights and privileges guaranteed to Alaska's citizens. Further, the University of Alaska is proud of the fact that it began life as the Alaska Agricultural and Mining College. However, Mr. President, what makes the University of Alaska truly unique is the fact that it is the only land grant college in the Nation that is virtually landless. 
   As my colleagues know, one of the oldest and most respected ways of financing America's educational system has been the land grant system. Established in 1785, this practice gives land to schools and universities for their use in supporting their educational endeavors. In 1862, Congress passed the Morrill Act which created the land grant colleges and universities as a way to underwrite the cost of higher education to more and more Americans. These colleges and universities received land from the federal government for facility location and, more importantly, as a way to provide sustaining revenues to these educational institutions. 
   The University of Alaska received the smallest amount of land of any state, with the exception of Delaware, that has a land grant college. Even the land grant college in Rhode Island received more land from the federal government than has the University of Alaska. In a state the size of Alaska, we should logically have one of the best and most fully funded land grant colleges in the country. Unfortunately, without the land promised under the land grant allocation system and earlier legislation, the University is unable to share as one of the premier land grant colleges in the country. 
   Previous efforts in Congress were made to fix this problem. These efforts date back to 1915, less than 50 years after the passage of the Morrill Act, when Alaska's Delegate James Wickersham shepherded a measure through Congress that set aside potentially more than a quarter of a million acres, in the Tanana Valley outside of Fairbanks, for the support of an agricultural college and school of mines. Following the practice established in the lower 48 for other land grant colleges, Wickersham's bill set aside every Section 33 of the unsurveyed Tanana Valley for the Alaska Agricultural College and School of Mines. Alaska's educational future looked very bright. 
   Many Alaskans saw the opportunity to set up an endowment system similar to that established by the University of Washington in the downtown center of Seattle, where valuable University lands are leased and provide funding for the University of Washington which uses those revenues in turn to provide for its programs and facilities. 
   Mr. President, before that land could be transferred to the Alaska Agricultural College and School of Mines (renamed the University of Alaska in 1935), the land had to be surveyed in order to establish the exact acreage included in the reserved land. The sections reserved for education could not be transferred to the College until they had been delineated. According to records of the time, it was unlikely, given the incredibly slow speed of surveying, that the land could be completely surveyed before the 21st century. Surveying was and is an extraordinarily slow process in Alaska's remote and unpopulated terrain. In all, only 19 section 33's--approximately 11,211 acres--were ever transferred to the University. Of this amount, 2,250 were used for the original campus and the remainder was left to support educational opportunities. 
   Recognizing the difficulties of surveying in Alaska, subsequent legislation was passed in 1929 that simply granted land for the benefit of the University. This grant totaled approximately 100,000 acres and to this day comprises the bulk of the University's roughly 112,000 acres of land--less than one third of what it was originally promised. In 1958, the Alaska Statehood Act was passed which extinguished the original land grants for all lands that remained unsurveyed. Thus, the University was left with little land with which to support itself and thus is unable to completely fulfill its mission as a land grant college. 
   Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today would redeem the promises made to the University in 1915 and put it on an even footing with the other land grant colleges in the United States. The bill provides the University with the land needed to support itself financially and offers it the chance to grow and continue to act as a responsible steward of the land and educator of our young people. The legislation also provides a concrete timetable under which the University must select its lands and the Secretary of the Interior must act upon those selections. 
   This legislation also contains significant restrictions on the land the University can select. The University cannot select land located within a Conservation System Unit. The University cannot select old growth timber lands in the Tongass National Forest. Finally, the University cannot select land validly conveyed to the State or an ANCSA corporation, or land used in connection with federal or military institutions. 
   Additionally, under my bill the University must relinquish extremely valuable inholdings in Alaska once it receives its state/federal selection awarded under Section 2, of this bill. Therefore, the result of this legislation will mean the relinquishment of prime University inholdings in such magnificent areas as the Alaska Peninsula & Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, The Kenai Fjords National Park, Wrangell St. Elias National Park and Preserve, and Denali Park and Preserve. So, Mr. President, not only does this bill uphold a decades old promise to the University of Alaska, it further protects Alaska's parks and refuges. 
   Specifically, this bill would grant the University 250,000 acres of federal land. Additionally, the University would be eligible to receive an additional 250K acres on a matching basis with the state for a total of 500K additional acres. This, obviously, would be done through the state legislative process involving the Governor, the Legislature, and the University's Board of Regents. 
   Mr. President, the state matching provision is an important component of this legislation. Most agree with the premise that the University was shorted land. However, some believe it is solely the responsibility of the federal government to compensate the University with land while others believe it is solely the responsibility of the state to grant the University land. The legislation I am introducing today offers a compromise giving both the state and the federal government the opportunity to contribute while at the same time providing the federal government with valuable inholdings in parks and refuges. 
   Finally, this bill contains a provision that incorporates a concept put forth by the Governor of Alaska. This provision directs the Secretary of the Interior to attempt to conclude an agreement with the University and the Governor of Alaska providing for sharing NPRA leasing revenues in lieu of land selections north of latitude 69 degrees North. The provision restricts any agreement regarding revenue sharing to prevent the University from obtaining more than ten percent of such annual revenues or more than nine million dollars each fiscal year. If an agreement is reached and provides for disposition of some portion of NPRA mineral leasing revenues to the University, the Secretary shall submit the proposed agreement to Congress for ratification. If the Secretary fails to reach an agreement within two years of enactment, or if Congress fails to ratify such agreement within three years from enactment, the University may select up to 92,000 of its 250,000 initial land grant from lands within NPRA north of latitude 69. 
   Therefore, this bill has been substantially changed from versions introduced in previous Congresses in two dramatic ways. First, in response to concerns from the Administration and environmental organizations the old growth areas of the Tongass National Forest are off limits for selection by the University. The only areas of the Tongass that could be selected by the University are those areas previously harvested. It is important that the University be allowed to select lands in this area as having the ability to study and manage as such areas are important tools for the University's School of Forestry. 
   The second substantial change to the bill, which was previously noted, is the  revenue sharing component. This aspect provides an alternative means of providing for the needs of the University. 
   With the passage of this bill, the University of Alaska will finally be able to act fully as a land grant college. It will be able to select lands that can provide the University with a stable revenue source as well as provide responsible stewardship for the land. 
   This is an exciting time for the University of Alaska. The promise that was made more than 80 years ago could be fulfilled by passage of this legislation and Alaskans could look forward to a very bright future for the University of Alaska and those who receive an education there.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this legislation requires the Secretary of the Interior to issue a report to the Congress that details the specific steps the Department of the Interior will take to contract activities and programs of the Department to Alaska Natives.  
   Legislation already exists for contracting with and hiring Alaska Natives. Sections 1307 and 1308 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act and section 638 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act are clear on these matters. The problem is that the law have been largely ignored. 
   Outside of a few studies that were contracted to Native Associations during the past two years, the record of the Department in contracting and local hiring is abysmal. 
   I have been told by representatives of this Administration that there are obstacles in both contracting with and hiring local Natives. When pressed, the obstacles are not well explained, if at all. 
   Mr. President, if there are valid obstacles, we should know specifically what they are so that Congress can address them. If there are not obstacles, then the Administration should begin to implement the law. My legislation requires a complete explanation of the ``Obstacles'' and a plan for implementing the law in accordance with the Alaska National Interest Lands Conversation Act and the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. 
   In addition to the report required by this legislation, the Secretary is also directed to initiate a pilot program to contract various National Park Service functions, operations and programs in northwest Alaska to local Native entities. 
   Mr. President, the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the other agencies within the Department have an opportunity to hire and contract with local Alaska Natives who were born, raised and live near and in our parks, refuges and public lands in Alaska. These individuals are more familiar with the area than persons hired from outside Alaska. They know the history, they know the hazards, they know about living and working in arctic conditions. Given the levels of unemployment in the area, it makes absolutely no sense not to hire these individuals. 
   I do not understand why any of one of these agencies or bureaus keep filing positions with persons from the lower 48--individuals who have little experience in Alaska--when they have a qualified individuals in the immediate area. 
   If we can just get the Federal agencies in the State of Alaska to read sections 1307 and 1308 of ANILCA and section 638 of ISEAA it would be a major step in the right direction. If Alaska Natives are given the opportunity to contract with and be employed by the Federal agencies in my State, everyone wins, no one loses, and the American public will be better served.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Inbox Privacy Act of 1999 on behalf of myself, Senators TORRICELLI, BURNS and REID. Our legislation provides a solution to the burden of junk e-mail, also known as spam, that now plagues the Internet. There are five main components to this legislation: 
   Online marketers must honestly identify themselves 
   Consumers have the ultimate decision as to what comes into their inbox 
   Consumers and domain owners can stop further transmissions of spam to those who do not want to receive it 
   Internet Service Providers are relieved from the burdens associated with spam 
   A federal solution is provided to a nationwide problem while giving states, ISP's, and the Federal Trade Commission authority to go after those who flood the Internet with fraudulent emails. 
   The burden of spam is evident in my home state of Alaska. Unlike urban and suburban areas of the nation where a local telephone call is all it takes to log onto the Internet, rural areas of Alaska and many other states have no such local access. 
   Every minute connected to the Internet, whether it is for researching a school project, checking a bank balance, searching for the latest information on the weather at the local airport, or even shopping online incurs a per minute long distance charge. The extra financial cost of the longer call to download spam may only be a small amount on a day to day basis, but over the long term this cost is a very real financial disincentive to using the Internet. Some estimates place the cost at over $200 per year for rural Americans. 
   If Internet commerce is to continue to expand, all Internet consumers must be able to avoid costs for the receipt of advertising material such as spam that they do not want to receive. As I've said before, the Internet is not a tool for every huckster to sell the Brooklyn Bridge. 
   Last Congress I was the author of Title III of S. 1618 which unanimously passed the Senate and was supported by a variety of interested Internet groups. Some wanted an outright ban on such solicitations, but banning non-fraudulent Internet commerce is a dangerous precedent to set, particularly where the problem today is caused by fraudulent marketers. I also recognize that there are First Amendment concerns raised by any Internet content legislation and am pleased that our approach has the support of civil liberties organizations. 
   The most significant difference between this legislation and Title III of S. 1618 is the addition of a domain-wide opt-out system that allows Internet domain owners to put up an electronic stop sign to signify their desire to not receive unsolicited commercial email to addresses served by their domain. However, to ensure that the Internet consumer has the ultimate choice, consumers would be able to inform their ISP of their continuing desire to receive junk e-mail. While I doubt that there will be too many Internet consumers who want to receive junk e-mail, Congress should not make the decision for them by banning junk e-mail outright, no matter how annoying it may be. Not only should consumers have the ultimate choice, but if Congress bans junk e-mail, what else on the Internet will we ban next? 
   Finally, I have included a state enforcement provision that allows all states to enforce a national standard on junk e-mail. As Congress has seen before in the Internet Tax Freedom debate, a unified approach to any Internet legislation is key to promoting the development of the Internet. Just as having 50 state tax policies on Internet transactions represents a poor policy decision, so would having 50 state policies on spam legislation. My approach solves this dilemma by setting such a national standard that provides for even greater protection that what a few states have already enacted. By setting a national standard, it also solves the constitutional dilemma that many states face regarding long-arm jurisdiction. 
   Mr. President, the Inbox Privacy Act represents a significant step forward for Internet consumers and domain owners and I urge its adoption by my colleagues.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am joined today by Senator JEFF BINGAMAN in introducing the Commemorative Coin Amendments Act of 1999. Our legislation would extend the new commemorative quarter program to include the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands. As one of the few Members of Congress who can remember when my home state was a territory and as Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee with jurisdiction over the territories of the United States, I feel that it is more than appropriate for the U.S. Mint to recognize the contributions of these six entities. 
   However, Mr. President, the reason for minting these six coins goes beyond historical significance. Americans who work in the mining and transportation industries will benefit from my legislation. The U.S. Treasury will benefit as collectors remove quarters from circulation. The government spends 5 cents to mint each quarter. Any quarter removed from circulation by collectors earns the U.S. Treasury a profit of 20 cents. A study by Coopers and Lybrand found that the the federal Treasury could take in more than $2 billion dollars for the first fifty quarter designs. Six more coins will certainly add to that revenue windfall. 
   Mr. President, let me turn to the historical reasons for this bill. The District of Columbia was the only land designated by the U.S. Constitution. It has served as the home of Congress and the White House for all but brief periods of time. Within its boundaries reside the Archives of the United States, home of the original Constitution and Declaration of Independence. The District of Columbia is home to numerous monuments honoring important Americans who have changed the course of history as well as events that have changed the course of our nation. The District of Columbia was where Martin Luther King spoke his moving ``I have a dream'' address. And finally, it is the place that the world looks to for political and economic leadership. 
   The inclusion of the territories of the United States in this legislation serves as an important reminder of our history. With very few exceptions, such as Texas and those States that formed the original thirteen Colonies, all of my colleagues come from States that at one time were territories. Four of us actually remember the days when our constituents were not represented in the Senate and were afforded only a non-voting delegate in the House. The history of our Nation is written in the development of the territories--the social and economic forces that forged our Nation. 
   Our current inhabited territories are an integral part of that heritage and are also a part of our future. Guam, the southernmost of the Mariana Islands, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico were acquired at the conclusion of the Spanish- 
   American war, as was the Philippines. Their acquisition and subsequent development was the focus of a spirited debate in Congress, the Administration, and eventually in the Supreme Court over the nature and applicability of provisions of the Constitution. Not since the Louisiana Purchase a century earlier had there been such a debate over the boundaries of the United States. Guam, acquired in one war, was occupied by Japan in another. The sacrifices of the residents of Guam prior to liberation led to the granting of citizenship and the establishment of full local self-government. Former President Bush was forced to ditch his plane during the conflict in the Marianas and our former colleague, Senator Heflin, was wounded in the liberation of Guam. 
   Puerto Rico, with a population approaching 4 million and an economy larger than many States, has set the mark in political self-government for those territories that are not fully under the Constitution. Puerto Rico was the first territory to achieve local self-government pursuant to a locally  drafted Constitution other than as part of either Statehood or Independence. Since that time, however, both American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas have adopted local constitutions and both Guam and the Virgin Islands exercise similar authorities under their Organic legislation. Puerto Rico has the longest continually occupied capital in the United States, San Juan, and was the site where one of its Governors, Ponce de Leon, sailed for Florida. 
   American Samoa was acquired under Treaties of Cession in 1900 and 1904 following the Tripartite Agreement between Great Britain, Germany, and the United States. The history of the Samoas demonstrates both the European conflicts in the Pacific as well as the emergence of the United States as a Pacific power. American Samoa, the only territory south of the Equator, demonstrates the diversity that marks this Nation. American Samoa is the only territory where the residents are nationals rather than citizens of the United States. Past Governors, such as Peter Coleman, have been important representatives of the United States in the Pacific community and respected leaders. 
   The United States Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark in 1916 for $25 million. The purchase did not provoke the divisive debates that surrounded the Louisiana Purchase nor some of the merriment that accompanied the purchase of Alaska. The Danish heritage continues to be evident in the capitol at Charlotte Amalie on St. Thomas as well as at Christiansted National Historic Site on St. Croix, the heart of the former Danish West Indies. Salt River Bay, on St. Croix, is the only known site where members of the Columbus expedition actually set foot on what is now United States soil. 
   The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is the newest territory of the United States. The area had been part of a League of Nations Mandate to Japan prior to World War II and saw some of the fiercest fighting of the Pacific theater, especially on Saipan. The attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki which brought the war to an end were launched from Tinian. After the war, the area became part of a United Nation's Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. In 1976 the United States approved a Covenant to establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, a document that had been negotiated with representatives of the Marianas government and approved in a local U.N. observed plebescite. Formal extension of United States sovereignty came with the termination of the Trusteeship by the Security Council a decade later. As an interesting historical note, the acquisition of the Northern Mariana Islands ends the artificial division created in 1898 when the United States acquired Guam and Spain sold the remainder of its possessions in the Marianas to Germany. 
   Mr. President, the District of Columbia and the territories are an important part of our heritage and our future. They encompass territory where our nation's government resides, where Columbus landed in the Virgin Islands, and where ``America's Day Begins'' in the Pacific. It is altogether fitting that their unique character and contributions be recognized by the issuance of appropriate coins.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President I rise today to recognize the outstanding accomplishments and distinguished service of Captain Dorothy C. Stratton, U.S. Coast Guard Reserve (Ret), on this her 100th birthday. She has served her country with honor as an educator, naval officer and public official. 
   Born in Brookfield, Missouri, Captain Stratton earned a Bachelor of Arts from Ottawa University in Ottawa, Kansas; a Master of Arts in Psychology from the University of Chicago; and a Doctorate of Philosophy in Student Personnel Administration from Columbia University. Captain Stratton joined Purdue University as the Dean of Women and Associate Professor of Psychology in 1933, becoming a full professor in 1940. 
   In June, 1942, with our nation embroiled in war, Professor Stratton left Purdue to join the Women Appointed Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES). She was assigned as the Assistant to the Commanding Officer of the U.S. Naval Training Station in Madison, Wisconsin. Due to the military's pressing need for personnel, Congress authorized the Women's Reserve of the U.S. Coast Guard. The Act creating the Women's Reserve was signed into law by President Roosevelt on November 23, 1942, and within hours, Stratton became the first director of the new organization. She was the first female officer accepted for service in the history of the U.S. Coast Guard. She rose from Lieutenant Commander to the rank of Commander on January 1, 1944 and to the rank of Captain one month later. 
   One of Captain Stratton's first acts as Director of the U.S. Coast Guard Women's Reserve was to coin the famous name that would distinguish them from the Navy WAVES and the Army WACS. In a memo to the Commandant ADM Russell R. Waesche, Stratton explained: ``The motto of the Coast Guard is `Semper Paratus--Always Ready.' The initials of this motto are of course, SPAR. Why not call the members of the Women's Reserve SPARS?.......As I understand it, a spar is often a supporting beam and that is what we hope each member of the Women's Reserve will be.'' Admiral Waesche agreed, and the rest, as they say, is history. 
   Captain Stratton led over 10,000 volunteers who responded to their nation's call for help between 1942 and 1946. She completed her service as Director of the SPARS in January, 1946 and was awarded the Legion of Merit. She then served as Director of Personnel for the International Monetary Fund from 1946 to 1950, and as the National Executive Director of the Girl Scouts of America from 1950 to 1960. 
   Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Captain Dorothy Stratton and to thank her for all she has done for this great country of ours. She is a shining example to us all, and it is truly a pleasure to wish her a happy birthday today.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that would require the Secretary of the Interior to report to Congress on the feasibility and desirability of recovering the cost to taxpayers of rescuing high altitude climbers on Mt. McKinley in Denali National Park and Preserve in the State of Alaska. 
   Mr. President, Denali National Park and Preserve attracts approximately 355,000 visitors per year who come to see the wildlife, the grandeur of our State, and to gaze at America's highest peak. Most are unaware that while they are taking in the breathtaking vista that is Mt. McKinley, there are approximately another 1,100 persons per year that are attempting to attain the 20,320 summit. 
   Climbing Mt. McKinley is certainly no easy walk in the Park. A typical year sees a dozen major rescue incidents and one or two fatal accidents. Extreme and unpredictable weather on Mt. McKinley make high altitude rescues very dangerous and very expensive. 
   Over the last few years the National Park Service has actively and successfully worked to reduce the loss of life and injury to climbers who have attempted to climb this mountain. The NPS spends more than $750,000 per year for education; pre-positioning supplies and materials at various altitudes on the mountain; the positioning of a special high altitude helicopter in the Park; and actual rescue attempts. 
   Just last year the military and the Park Service spent four days and $221,818 rescuing 6 sick and injured  British climbers who disregarded warnings and advice from park rangers stationed on the mountain. This rescue included what is probably the world's highest short haul helicopter rescue at 19,000 feet and entailed a very high level of risk for the rescue team. This is just one example of many rescues the Park Service conducts each year on Mt. McKinley. 
   Mr. President, I personally do not feel that the American taxpayer should be left with the bill for rescues on this mountain. The Federal Government does not force these climbers to climb; they engage in this activity voluntarily and with full knowledge of the risks. While I admire the courage and tenacity of mountain climbers, I do not think it is fair to divert scarce park funds from services that benefit the majority of park visitors for the purpose of providing extraordinarily expensive services to a small number of users who put themselves in harm's way with their eyes wide open. Mountain climbers are a special breed who are proud of their self-sufficiency and independence-- and rightly so. For that reason I think they should recognize the simple equity of paying their fair share of the public costs of their sport. 
   As a result of a recent field hearing on this issue, I found that while I have received many letters of support, there are a few stalwart individuals who do not agree with my point of view and have raised some legitimate questions. That is why I want the Secretary of the Interior to look at the feasibility and desirability of some sort of a cost recovery system that puts a minimal burden on climbers, whether it be an insurance requirement, bonding, or any other proposal. The pros and cons of these cost recovery mechanisms need to be carefully explored before we act. 
   Last but not least, Mr. President, I want the Secretary to evaluate requiring climbers to show proof of medical insurance so that hospitals in Alaska and elsewhere are not left holding the bag as they sometimes are under present circumstances. It is a good neighbor policy that should be put into effect at the earliest opportunity.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Rural and Remote Community Fairness Act. This Act will lead to a brighter future for rural and remote communities by establishing three new programs that will address the unique economic and environmental challenges faced by small communities in rural and remote areas across this country. I am pleased that this legislation is co-sponsored by the Minority Leader, Senator DASCHLE. 
   The bill authorizes up to $100 million a year in grant aid from 2000 through 2006 for any communities across the nation with populations of less than 10,000 which face electric rates in excess of 150 percent of the national average retail price. The money can go for electricity system improvements, energy efficiency and weatherization efforts, water and sanitation improvements or work to solve leaking fuel storage tanks. 
   The bill also amends the Rural Electrification Act to authorize Rural and Remote Electrification Grants of an additional $20 million a year to the same communities. The grants can be used to increase energy efficiency, lower electricity rates or provide for the modernization of electric facilities. 
   The bill also establishes a new program providing rural recovery community development block grants. This will provide for the development and maintenance of viable rural areas through the provision of affordable housing and community development assistance for rural areas with excessively high rates of outmigration and low per capita income levels. 
   This nation has well-established programs for community development grants. The majority of these programs were established to help resolve the very real problems found in this Nation's urban areas. However, our most rural and remote communities experience different, but equally real, problems that are not addressed by existing law. Not only are these communities generally ineligible for the existing programs, their unique challenges, while sometimes similar to those experienced by urban areas, require a different focus and approach. 
   The biggest single economic problem facing small communities is the expense of establishing a modern infrastructure. These costs, which are always substantial, are exacerbated in remote and rural areas. The existence of this infrastructure, including efficient housing, electricity, bulk fuel storage, waste water and water service, is a necessity for the health and welfare of our children, the development of a prosperous economy and minimizing environmental problems. 
   There is a real cost in human misery and to the health and welfare of everyone, especially our children and our elderly from poor or polluted water or bad housing or an inefficient power system. Hepatitis B infections in rural Alaska are five times more common than in urban Alaska. We just have to do better if we are to bring our rural communities into the 21 Century. 
   The experience of many of Alaskans is a perfect example. Most small communities or villages in Alaska are not interconnected to an electricity grid, and rely upon diesel generators for their electricity. Often, the fuel can only be delivered by barge or airplane, and is stored in tanks. These tanks are expensive to maintain, and in many cases, must be completely replaced to prevent leakage of fuel into the environment. While the economic and environmental savings clearly justify the construction of new facilities, these communities simply don't have the ability to raise enough capital to make the necessary investments. 
   As a result, these communities are forced to bear an oppressive economic and environmental burden that can be eased with a relatively small investment on the part of the Federal government. I can give you some examples: in Manley Hot Springs, Alaska, the citizens pay almost 70 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity. In Igiugig, Kokhanok, Akiachak Native Community, and Middle Kuskokwim, consumers all pay over 50 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity. The national average is around 7 cents per kilowatt hour. 
   Further, in Alaska, for example, many rural villages still lack modern water and sewer sanitation systems taken for granted in all other areas of America. According to a Federal Field Working Group, 190 of the state's villages have ``unsafe" sanitation systems, 135 villages still using ``honey buckets'' for waste disposal. Only 31 villages have a fully safe, piped water system; 71 villages having only one central watering source. 
   These are not only an Alaskan problem. The highest electricity rates in America are paid by a small community in Missouri, and communities in Maine, as well as islands in Rhode Island and New York will likely qualify for this program. Providing safe drinking water and adequate waste treatment facilities is a problem for very small communities all across this land. 
   What will this Act do to address these problems? First, the Act authorizes $100 million per year for the years 2000-2006 for block grants to communities of under 10,000 inhabitants who pay more than 150% of the national average retail price for electricity. 
   The grants will be allocated by the Secretary of Housing and Urban 
   Development among eligible communities proportionate to cost of electricity in the community, as compared to the National average. The communities may use the grants only for the following eligible activities:  
   Low-cost weatherization of homes and other buildings; 
   Construction and repair of electrical generation, transmission, distribution, and related facilities; 
   Construction, remediation and repair of bulk fuel storage facilities; 
   Facilities and training to reduce costs of maintaining and operating electrical generation, distribution, transmission, and related facilities;  
   Professional management and maintenance for electrical generation, distribution and transmission, and related facilities; 
   Investigation of the feasibility of alternate energy services; 
   Construction, operation, maintenance and repair of water and waste water services; 
   Acquisition and disposition of real property for eligible activities and facilities; and 
   Development of an implementation plan, including administrative costs for eligible activities and facilities.  
   In addition this bill will amend the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to authorize Rural and Remote Electrification Grants for $20 million per year for years 2000-2006 for grants to qualified borrowers under the Act that are in rural and remote communities who pay more than 150% of the national average retail price for electricity. These grants can be used to increase energy efficiency, lower electricity rates, or provide or modernize electric facilities. 
   This Act makes a significant step toward resolving the critical social, economic and environmental problems faced by our Nation's rural and remote communities. I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   For the information of the Senate and the public, the bill can also be obtained from the Internet at: http://thomas.loc.gov.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we are ten years older, but are we ten years wiser since the Exxon Valdez oil spill? 
   With the anniversary of the Nation's worst oil spill occurring today, the question most asked by national media is how the environment and wildlife of Alaska has fared. In fact, just last week on a ``60 minutes'' story this exact question was asked. It was asked not only by the network doing the story, but by the Alaskans being interviewed. 
   What's particularly frustrating is that in many cases it is still not possible to give informed answers. 
   In the years since 11.3 million gallons of crude oil bubbled into the sea, the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (EVOS) Trustees Council has had nearly $800 million of the eventual $900 million that Exxon will pay at their disposal to fund scientific studies. Those studies should have determined the health of marine life, wildlife and the ecosystem of Prince William Sound. But according to the latest summary of scientific studies, while it is possible to say that some species have or are recovering, it is not possible to give a full accounting. 
   According to a report from the council last month very little is known about the health of cutthroat trout, Dolly Varden, rockfish or Kittlitz's murrelets. And there is only slightly more information on the health of killer whales, pigeon guillemots, cormorants, and common loon, harbor seals and harlequin ducks. 
   While it is heartening that the Sound appears to be recovering sooner than many thought likely, and that herring and salmon stocks are recovering as  are bald eagles and river otters, it is frustrating that more hard scientific data has not been gathered. 
   That is why, Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation, on behalf of myself and Senator STEVENS, that will provide for more science to be done on the impacted spill area. The legislation I am introducing will allow for a higher rate of interest to be earned through outside investments of the settlement funds from the Exxon Valdez oil spill. 
   The legislation specifies that the interest on investments received under this new authority must be used to support marine research and economic restoration projects for the fishing industry and local fishermen. If the trustees choose to use this authority, an additional $20 million to $30 million could be generated for research and restoration between now and 2001. 
   The legislation further requires the trustees to present a report to Congress recommending a structure the trustees believe would be most effective and appropriate for the administration and expenditure of remaining funds and interest received. This provision is also consistent with comments from the public suggesting that an independent science-oriented board should control the process of funding science projects, rather than trustees who represent agencies that may be seeking project funding. 
   I, for one, believe the Council's priorities have been misplaced which has necessitated this legislation. They have been unwilling to admit that science does not yet provide many mitigation answers; instead, the spill trustees have decided to go on a land buying spree as an alternative. 
   This is a mistake, Mr. President. 
   In a State where 68 percent of all land is federally owned and where individuals own less than 1 percent of all property, the trustees have allocated $416 million of the initial $900 million court settlement just for land acquisitions. They have nearly completed the purchase of 647,000 acres in and around Prince William Sound and just recently voted to set aside an additional $55 million to fund acquisitions, literally, forever even though most of the land being bought was not directly affected by the spill. 
   Alaska Natives worked for decades to win the 1971 land settlement that gave them control of 44 million acres of Alaska. Now, in less than a quarter of a century, Natives have lost much of the land they had fought to gain--a good part of the Native lands in the region have been reacquired through the actions of the trustees. It is ironic, indeed, that the United States purchased Alaska for $7.2 million in 1867 and that 60 times more money already has been committed to buy back parts of it. 
   Back in 1994 when $600 million of the settlement was still uncommitted, I urged the trustees to commit the bulk of the settlement to a ``permanent fund'' that would provide a perpetual source of significant funding for research or mitigation projects. I also urged the trustees to utilize the expertise of the University of Alaska in undertaking those studies. I warned that if too much funding was allocated to land acquisition, or spent on marginal science, less money would be available to fund sound studies to shed light on the mysteries affecting commercial and sport fisheries and marine life and wildlife in the Sound. 
   In the intervening years we have seen General Accounting Office audits documenting that the trustees have pad on average 56 percent above government-appraised value for the lands it has acquired. We've seen a situation this year where the trustees paid nearly $80 million for lands on Kodiak Island, while the Department of the Interior set the value of those same lands at about one-third that amount when it came to funding revenue sharing payments to the Kodiak Island Borough. 
   While the trustees recently voted to place about $115 million of the settlement aside to provide interest to fund future scientific studies, I believe the earnings from all of the roughly $170 million still owed by Exxon should be devoted to pay for marine research and monitoring including applied fisheries research. I believe this approach will give us answers, not leave us guessing, about what is happening to the Sound and what we can do to improve the habitat of the region. The legislation we introduce today will begin to address this need. 
   Long after the Sound has healed its wounds, those lands bought by the trustees will be lost forever to economic activity and to the Native heritage. Nowhere could this be clearer than the example of one Native corporation that agreed to sell its lands with the intent to invest in a perpetual trust to help children go to school and provide solutions to other problems. Instead it was pressured to make a one time payment to each shareholder. 
   The longest-lasting legacy of the tragedy may be that some of the Natives find themselves like the Biblical Esau who sold his birthright to Jacob for a mess of pottage and bread. When the meal was gone so was his heritage. When that one-time payment has been spent, what will have been gained and what will pass on to their children? 
   Today, another tragedy is clear, we still do not have the answers to the effects of the spill, even though we had the wherewithal to have obtained them. 
   Mr. President, immediately following the spill, I sponsored a provision in the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which was passed by Congress, to create Regional Citizens Advisory Councils, giving local residents the authority and the resources to improve all aspects of oil transport planning and cleanup. Patterned after a concept then in place at the Port of Sullom Voe in the North Sea's Shetland Islands, there is no question that the oversight and creativity that the councils engendered have done the most to make Alaska's oil transportation system the best in the world. 
   It is time for Congress to act again today, to ensure that we have the resources to obtain the best science available in understanding Prince William Sound. I believe this bill will allow us to do just that.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it appears that we are on the verge of sending American warplanes to bomb Serbian installations in and around Kosovo in an effort to force Yugoslav President Milosevic to accept the terms of a peace agreement that he has, so far, rejected. I stand on the floor of the Senate to express my strong opposition to this policy and warn the Administration that the United States may be blindly heading into a war whose outcome is far from pre-determined. 
   Mr. President, I believe the President has failed to articulate a rationale to the American people that can justify an act of war by NATO against Serbia. Nor do I believe that the Administration has demonstrated what vital interest justifies armed intervention. 
   When the President originally announced his plan to send 4,000 American soldiers to Kosovo as part of a larger NATO force, it was premised on the idea that the troops would be deployed, as in Bosnia, as a peacekeeping force. I had serious concerns about this commitment because it was not clear to me whether American troops would be stationed in Kosovo for a month, for a year, or for a decade. Nor did I believe that it was in our national interest to participate in this operation because I do not believe there is any vital interest of the United States that is at stake in this civil war. 
   And I emphasize ``civil war.''  
   Mr. President, the peacekeeping commitment was made several weeks ago. In the intervening period, one thing has happened. There is no peace to keep. 
   Although the rebels in Kosovo have agreed to the terms of a peace agreement, the Yugoslavian government has rejected the terms of the agreement in part because it rejects the idea of having NATO troops police its sovereign territory in Kosovo. 
   Having failed to negotiate a peace agreement, the Administration has now changed its strategy. We are fueling up our warplanes, targeting our cruise missiles, and planning to launch air strikes against the Serbs in an effort to force Milosevic to accept the peace agreement. Never mind that the peace agreement he is being 
   asked, or forced, to accept--could allow for the independent future of a province within his country. 
   Yes, Mr. President, this is an intervention by the United States in a civil war where rebels in one province seek independence. And by choosing to bomb the Serbians, we have directly taken the side of the Kosovo rebels. 
   Make no mistake, our air strikes against Serbian forces are strongly supported by the Kosovo rebels who have been fighting for independence. And by backing the rebels, the bombing will encourage the independence movement with the prospect that the borders of Kosovo and Albania ultimately will be redrawn along ethnic lines. Is that what our goal is? To break up a country? 
   Mr. President, American airstrikes are not going to be a cakewalk by any means. We have already been advised of this by our military. 
   The terrain in this area is heavily fortified with anti-aircraft emplacements. What will happen if American airmen are shot down by surface to air missiles? What happens if our bombing campaign does not force Milosevic to change his posture, just as our near-daily air strikes have done nothing to Saddam Hussein. 
   Are we willing to send in ground combat troops to convince Milosevic to accept the terms of the peace agreement? How many? 50,000? 100,000? 200,000? If we are unwilling to commit ground troops to force the terms of this so-called peace agreement, then I believe we should not commit a single American pilot. 
   Mr. President, I am sympathetic to the people in Kosovo who have been brutalized by Milosovic, just as my sympathy has run deep for the people throughout Yugoslavia who have known nothing but war for over a generation. But is our opposition to Milosevic reason enough to sacrifice American lives to an undefined cause? Milosovic is a terrorist; he is a killer. We should bring him to justice for crimes against humanity; but we should not engage in a war which will cost American lives and continue indefinitely. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I would simply remind my colleagues that from the outset I have been concerned that American involvement in Kosovo would become another Bosnia. I take it back. Knowing what I know now about the region, about the opposition, I am concerned that it will not be like Bosnia--and that many American lives will be lost in the process of enforcing an undefined objective. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I am pleased to yield to my friend from Idaho. 
   Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment, and I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.  
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>106-murkowski-ak-2-19990323</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, if I may have the attention of my colleagues, let me identify specifically what is intended by this amendment. 
   First of all, I should identify the specific area about which we are concerned. This is my State of Alaska. Over here on the right is Canada. We have our State Capitol here in Juneau. Just north of Juneau is an extraordinary jewel of our National Park Service called Glacier Bay. Glacier Bay is a pretty substantial area in size. It consists of about 3.3 million acres. That is about the size of 3 Grand Canyons or 4 Yosemites or 17 Shenandoah National Parks or 825 Gettysburgs. It is part of the State of Alaska which has about 33,000 miles of coastline. 
   Let me further identify specifically what Glacier Bay consists of relative to the map of Alaska which is before you. 
   We have in southern Alaska in the northern tip, before you cross the Gulf of Alaska to go up to the Anchorage area, the area specifically known as Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. Over in this corner we have Gustavus, which is a small community, Bartlett Cove, where the Park Service has its concessions, and down here we have Chichagof Island, and over here, Juneau. The purpose of this map is to give the visitor some idea of the extraordinary size and attractiveness of Glacier Bay and the realization that there are absolutely no roads in this area, with the exception of this very short road from Gustavus, where there is an airfield, to Bartlett Cove. This is very rugged, glacier-bound terrain. The only entry is by vessel or aircraft flying over the area. There are kayaks, small boats, and so forth. The activity is monitored by the Park Service quite effectively. 
   If you look at the map of Alaska, you also find that this entire area of Canada has no outlet to the Pacific Ocean. That is from roughly Cordova down through Ketchikan, all this area of northern British Columbia, Whitehorse, the Yukon Territory. There is no access. But there is in Glacier Bay a very tiny area, at the Tarr Inlet, where a glacier occasionally recedes and provides a bit of real estate in Canada at the head of Glacier Bay. Of course, the difficulty is you cannot go through a glacier for access. I just point this out to you so you will have a little better view of the real estate, the topography, and so forth. 
   What we have before us in this issue is the traditional right of fishermen and subsistence gatherers who live in the area, either in Gustavus or Hoonah, which is a Native village. These are gatherers. What does that mean? To these people it is part of their heritage, part of their lifestyle. 
   Mr. President, we do not have any chickens in this particular area. It is pretty wet, pretty cold. So the Natives occasionally go in and gather sea gull eggs. Now, there is not much demand for sea gull eggs. The question of their continued right to go in and gather those eggs as well as fish is what this issue is all about, because the action by the Park Service would preclude traditional fishing and gathering, which has been going on here for hundreds of years. 
   The fishermen and subsistence gatherers really can't go someplace else. It is my opinion and that of my senior colleague, Senator STEVENS, that their rights should be respected. 
   What have we got that is different about this issue? The difference is the State of Alaska has indicated its intent to file suit and our Governor, Governor Knowles, has asserted claim to the submerged lands within the park. Granted, the Park Service has control of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. The State, under the Statehood Act, was given control of the inland waters. The question is, Who has jurisdiction over waters within the park? 
   That is the issue. 
   The conflict today is that the Park Service is enforcing today an elimination of fishing and an elimination of subsistence gathering, but the State has indicated it intends to bring suit. 
   I have a press release by the Governor of the State of Alaska dated March 4 indicating the State's intent of bringing suit against the Interior Department over Glacier Bay fishing. It is titled, ``Governor asserts claim to submerged lands within park.'' This matter is being brought before us today, because the existence of the suit suggests that until it is decided, the residents of the area should not be disallowed their conventional access for fishing and gathering. 
   In real terms, the delay does not jeopardize any park value. Gathering and fishing is fully regulated by the State of Alaska, the Department of Fish and Game, very effectively and very efficiently. All important fisheries are under the system that would prevent any increase--any undue effort on the resource. In the thousands of years that the Natives have been in the area, there has been no evidence of any resource problem. 
   Let me also identify a couple of other specifics here. This is a traditional Hoonah Tlingit village that existed at the turn of the century. You can see the fish drying on the racks and the homes, the summer camps, where the Native people resided. This picture was actually taken in Bartlett Cove in Glacier Bay. 
   The unfortunate part of this is, this village no longer exists. The Park Service eliminated it. The Park Service burned several Indian houses and smokehouses like this in the seventies. Again, this was a summer camp, a summer village. 
   The history of subsistence in Glacier Bay spans, as near as we can tell, Mr. President, about 9,000 years. The Tlingit name of the bay means ``main place of the Huna people'' or was referred to as the ``Huna breadbasket,'' because they depended, if you will, for their livelihood on some of the renewable resources there. 
   As many as five Native strongholds once existed inside the park boundary, but, as I have indicated, the Natives were gradually forced out of their traditional places, and in the seventies the National Park Service burned down the Tlingit fishing camps like this in the park. 
   Limited fishing began back in 1885, long before Glacier Bay was named as a national park. Again, it is interesting to reflect on the claim of jurisdiction of the Park Service. Not only did they claim the inland waters, but they claimed 3 miles out along the Gulf of Alaska, from roughly Dry Bay, which is near Yakutat, 3 miles out into these rich fishing grounds, which have always been open for commercial fishing under the State department of fish and game. They have the enforcement capability, and that is the point of mentioning this, for 3 miles out, to close that as well. 
   Again, my appeal is, let the court determine who has control over the inland waters of the park, and let's get on with allowing the traditional gathering and limited commercial fishing activity that takes place there. 
   As we look at a couple of things that are dos and don'ts, this is no longer allowed under the Park Service proposal. One- or two-person family-operated boats are not welcome. They are not welcome in the park anymore. There is no good reason for it. They say they do not want a commercial activity. But this is what they do allow in the park: A 2,000-passenger cruise ship as big as three football fields. That is allowed. If that is not a commercial activity, I don't know what is. I happen to support it. You can look at the topography, the glaciers. There is no better way to see Glacier Bay National Park than from the deck of a cruise ship. But to suggest there is something wrong with the subsistence dependence of the Native people and something wrong with limited commercial fishing because it is commercial, and then to support what is truly commercial--the cruise ships--why, I think that is a grave inconsistency.  
   I think it is important to go back to what the local residents were assured they would have--the local residents of southeastern 
   Alaska. They were assured, as local residents, that the Government would not eliminate traditional uses, including fishing and subsistence gathering. That certainly is not the case anymore, is it? 
   I think it is also important to recognize that while nationwide park regulations adopted in 1966 prohibited fishing in freshwater parks, these did not prohibit fishing in the marine or salt waters of Glacier Bay. 
   I wish I had this in chart. The Park Service proposes closing fisheries in Glacier Bay, as we have already ascertained. But what is their overall policy nationally? In Assateague Island National Seashore in Maryland and Virginia, the Park Service authorizes commercial fishing. Biscayne National Park in Florida, the Park Service authorizes commercial fishing. Buck Island Reef National Monument, U.S. Virgin Islands, commercial fishing is OK there. Canaveral National Seashore in Florida, fishing is OK there. Cape Hatteras National Seashore, North Carolina, commercial fishing is OK. Cape Kruzenstern National Monument in Alaska--way, way, way up here by Kotzebue--commercial fishing is OK there. Channel Islands, California, commercial fishing is OK. Fire Island National Seashore in New York, commercial fishing is all right. Gulf Island National Seashore, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, commercial fishing is OK. Isle Royale National Park in Michigan, commercial fishing is fine. Jean Lafitte National Historic Park, Louisiana, commercial fishing is OK. Lake Mead National Area, Nevada, fishing OK. Redwood National Park, California, commercial fishing is OK. Virgin Islands National Park, fishing is OK. 
   Why kick out just Alaska, a few residents who rely on their traditional gathering? That is the question. And another question is, What is the justification? 
   The fisheries consist of small numbers of small vessels, as I indicated. These are a type of traditional vessels, trollers, mom-and-pop--many are a lot smaller than that--fishing for salmon. But Glacier Bay is not a significant salmon spawning ground, because there are no major rivers. The water is very glacially silty and, as a consequence, anadromous fish do not use habitat in the upper parts of the bay. They move in here a little bit to feed, that's all. Mostly, we have some crab fishing, we have some halibut fishing that is seasonal, and some bottom fish. These fish, as I have indicated, are not under any threat. There is no danger to the resource. All are carefully managed for subsistence harvest by the State of Alaska, and most of them are under limited entry. 
   There is an argument out there that fishing is incompatible with such uses as sports fishing or kayaking, but these have been rejected by the various groups, the sport fishing groups, the kayak concessions, who favor continuation of limited commercial fishing and subsistence gathering. 
   What are we really talking about in numbers? Because the big Department of Interior comes down and says they are opposed to this. They want to eliminate this activity. But for the people, this is their livelihood. They have no place else to go. They appeal to the Senate. I, as one of the two Senators from Alaska, proudly represent them in their voice crying out for fairness, crying out for justice. 
   The Gustavus community has 436 residents; 55 are actually engaged in fishing. Gustavus is right here. Elfin Cove across the way, directly across, has 54 people. Out of those 54 people, 47 are engaged in fishing. Hoonah, a Tlingit Indian village, has 900 people, 228 involved in fishing. Pelican City, 187 residents, and 86 in fishing. That might not sound like much, but these are real people. This is their real lifestyle, and they are pleading for fairness and justice. I think we have an obligation to them. 
   Mr. President, let me just read a note from Wanda Culp, a Tlingit historian. This was written February 13, 1998. I quote:  
   The 1980 ANILCA law has done more damage to the Tlingit use of Glacier Bay through National Park Service management. Since the 1925 establishment of Glacier Bay National Park, the National Park Service has been systematically eliminating the native people, the Tlingit people, out of Glacier Bay through their management practices. 
   In the 1970s, the National Park Service destroyed the Huna fish camps, burned down the smoke houses when tourism began its importance in Glacier Bay.  
   That is a little bit of the history. I could comment on the fisheries at greater length. I could comment on the research that suggests that the French explorer, LaPerouse, in 1746, saw the local Tlingit fishing here. The park was established in 1916. But the Tlingit people have used it as a fishing camp as long as recorded or verbal traditional history of that proud people exists. 
   I know we are going to have objections relative to prior arrangements concerning Glacier Bay, and I hope my colleagues will note that in the amendment we address the issue of the crab fishing, and I should like to refer to that. 
   In the amendment, we specifically say ``with the exception of the closure of the Dungeness crab fisheries under section 123(b) of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.'' This is a certain type of fishery, a crab fishery, and we concede that a previous agreement to close it is binding. So that crab fishery is closed. There is no question about that. Compensation for that closure was provided for, but has not yet been to fishermen. 
   The appeal to each and every Member is that while the State contests the question of who has jurisdiction in Glacier Bay, the Native people continue to be allowed to subsist and gather, and that the limited commercial fishery that is under the authority and management of the State of Alaska be allowed to continue. 
   Why deprive these people simply because this matter is going to be resolved in the courts of the United States, particularly--again, I would emphasize--when we have acknowledged the number of national parks, marine refuges, and so forth that commercial fishing is allowed to take place in. So if we get into a debate, as we may, about any reference to the Dungeness crab and the compensation issue, I want to make sure the RECORD reflects the reality that no binding agreement has been made on other fisheries in the bay. There was reference to allowing them to continue to fish without compensation for one generation. So we are accepting the agreement on the Dungeness crab, but we are asking respectfully that we be allowed to continue the other present practices within Glacier Bay until the court suit is settled. 
   You may wonder how this sits in the scheme of things, as we have expended a good deal of time and effort debating Kosovo and whether we should initiate an action there. 
   Well, here we are talking about a few real people in my State of Alaska, people who are out there whose lives and livelihoods, as they view it, are at risk. They are looking to us for relief. So 
   by this amendment, I implore my colleagues to recognize equity and fairness; how these people have been, if you will, removed from their heritage by the Park Service, and now that heritage is about to be terminated inasmuch as it would remove subsistence activities. 
   I remind my colleagues that while there has been proposed remuneration for fishermen, there has never been any proposed remuneration for the subsistence-dependent Native people. So I encourage consideration be given to the merits of what we are asking. I think it is right. I think it is just. I think it is fair. If you consider the overall scheme of things, the Park Service, while managing Glacier Bay, for reasons unknown to me, has had a difficult time trying to determine what is, indeed, a commercial activity that is OK; namely, these large cruise ships, and what is no longer OK, which is a small fishing activity or the traditional rights of the Native people to gather in that area. There would be absolutely no harm done by allowing this moratorium to stand, if, indeed, it prevails, until such time as the courts resolve this issue once and for all as a consequence of the fact the State has seen fit to bring suit on who has jurisdiction over the inland marine waters. 
   I see some of my colleagues may wish to discuss this amendment. I am happy to respond to any questions. 
   I gather we are under no time agreement.

<DOCNO>106-murkowski-ak-5-19990323</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may respond to my friend from Rhode Island, I think he is confusing or misinterpreting the intent of our amendment. 
   If one examines the amendment closely, there is a recognition of the deal that was made last year. That recognition is in line 5 where it says,  
   ..... except the closure of Dungeness crab fisheries under Section 123(b) of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies.  
   We are abiding by that arrangement that was made and we are not changing that. 
   The crab fishermen, I might add, would much rather fish than be paid by the Federal Government not to fish. They are, in fact, being eliminated from their fishery in that particular part of Glacier Bay. 
   To suggest that we are changing the deal is, in fact, totally inaccurate and, again, is a misinterpretation. 
   I hope that my distinguished colleague will recognize that, indeed, there is a difference. First of all, the crab fishermen have not been paid one red cent by the Federal Government. They will, hopefully, be paid, but that has not occurred yet. We are talking about the balance of the fishery, which amounts to some bottom fish and some halibut. 
   We are also talking about something that is more important, which really, I say to the Senator from Rhode Island, is overlooked: What is the value of the subsistence to the dependent Native people who are being kicked out and eliminated? They are not receiving any remuneration or being taken care of in any deal. Would that be just, I ask my friend from Rhode Island, if it were his State? Would it be right if the indigenous people could no longer gather sea gull eggs when they don't have chickens? I mean that in a literal sense because, as the Senator is well aware, we don't have any chickens up there; it is too wet, too cold. They rely on a few sea gull eggs, and they have always been allowed to do that, for generation after generation. Is that justice?

<TEXT>
   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Well, Mr. President, perhaps I can enlighten my colleagues a little bit. I would be prepared to respond to questions. He refers to waiting for a management plan from the Park Service. We have that management plan, Mr. President. That management plan is quite explicit. It is to close the commercial activities associated with fishing. I encourage my colleague to recognize it for what it is. If you look at this picture, this is commercial fishing activity. They don't want commercialization of the park. I don't see my friends from Montana or Rhode Island commenting about this commercial activity, where 2,000 people are aboard this ship. That is a commercial activity. They are paying to come into Glacier Bay. 
   The management plan is a management dictate by the Department of the Interior to kick out the fishermen and to eliminate the Native people from Hoonah, Elfin Cove, and so on. There is not an awful lot of affection for the Park Service, which I think my friend from Montana, who knows something about rural America, understands when the Federal Government just comes in through a process of osmosis and dictates more and more attention. 
   Now, we have not changed this deal. Last year's deal eliminates the Dungeness crab for compensation. It is in the amendment. The other fisheries inside the bay were proposed to be closed--and this is what I think he is referring to--after one 
   generation without compensation. They don't have any compensation. So basically, when you suggest that the State and Federal Government can work together on some kind of a management resolve, the Federal Government has spoken. It is kicking them out. 
   The Federal Government maintains that it has jurisdiction over the inland waters. The State has seen fit to indicate that it is going to file suit to determine who has jurisdiction. Make no mistake about it, Mr. President, the Federal Government and Department of the Interior has a philosophy of creeping bureaucracy where they extend their jurisdiction; and they can do it if the State is not successful in resolving its suit. They have jurisdiction 3 miles out from Federal land. Believe me, it is just a matter of time before they come around for Bartlett Cove and go out to Cape Spencer and north from Cape Spencer up toward Yakutat. 
   So we are accepting the Dungeness crab deal. But there is no justification for more--and I implore my colleagues to recognize this. Let the courts decide it, but for goodness sake, in the meantime, allow the Native people to continue what they have been doing for thousands of years; allow the limited commercial fishery to continue until such time as the court gets it resolved. 
   I would love to compromise on this, but there is no compromise with the Park Service. They want to eliminate the fisheries. The State has brought suit. That is what is new and different about this. My colleagues fail to recognize that the State is saying, OK, it is time to settle the jurisdiction issue. We have tried to negotiate and work out with the Park Service a management plan that would allow the State to continue to manage it. What does the Park Service know about managing fisheries? They have no biologists. The State of Alaska spends more than any other State on fishery biology; we are  good at it. That is why we have fish. To suggest that the Park Service should enter into an process to generate expertise in this area is unreasonable, impractical and, finally, unnecessary. 
   We have nothing but creeping advancement by the Department of the Interior within our State because we are a public land State. But it is time that the people of Alaska express their views, and they have expressed their views through the Governor's announcement of the suit. 
   Again, it is not the same as 6 months ago. The lawsuit changes that. The omnibus bill, in spite of what my colleagues from Montana and Rhode Island have said, was not ever considered satisfactory; it was only considered to delay more sweeping closures. To suggest that this matter has been debated on this floor is totally inaccurate. It has not been debated before. This is to allow the judicial process to be completed, and that is what the suit is all about. 
   Again, in the interest of fairness, Mr. President, why does the Park Service say it is OK to commercially fish in Maryland, in Assateague; in Florida, Biscayne; in the Virgin Islands, Buck Island; in Canaveral, Florida; in Cape Hatteras, North Carolina; in Channel Islands, California; in Fire Island, New York; in Gulf Island, Alabama and Florida, on and on and on. 
   But it is not OK anymore here. Here you have an added dimension. You have the people--the few hundred people who are dependent on Glacier Bay for a subsistence lifestyle and a small amount of commercial fishing. 
   We are not reneging on any deal, we are merely keeping people working--keeping people working, keeping people employed, keeping people productive while the jurisdictional issue is decided. What in the world is wrong with that? The courts are going to make this decision. But, for goodness' sake, let the people who are dependent on it for their lifestyle and their traditions continue. 
   Mr. President, I have gone on long enough. If there are some questions of my friend from Montana, I would be happy to answer.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I don't know. We have had access since we became a State in 1959 and the Federal Government always recognized the state's management. They have technically allowed this to go on since 1959. Suddenly, under this administration, they are kicking us out. 
   So I don't know what a year, or 2, or 3, necessarily has to do with it. The point is, it is going to be resolved. If the State loses, it is all over. 
   Mr. President, let me conclude by explaining why it is important for the Senate to address this issue. Again, we should not put people on public assistance without a cause. That is what we are doing here with these subsistence dependents. We shouldn't second-guess the court. Let the court decide, and recognize that there are real people out there--real constituents of mine and yours--whose lives and livelihoods are really at risk, and they are looking to you and me for relief. This is all they have. 
   So I implore my colleagues to recognize the legitimacy of this. 
   It will be my intention, Mr. President, at the appropriate time, to ask for the yeas and nays, subject to whatever the joint leadership decides to do about future votes. But I will ask for a vote on the amendment. 
   I thank the Chair.

Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to read my amendment and recognize the consideration that has been made to live by the agreement by recognizing that the closure of a Dungeness fishery under this section will occur as agreed to, and the balance of the fisheries have never been addressed on this floor or debated. 
   I conclude by referring to one remark, which my friend made concerning this beautiful wilderness and the opposition of commercial activity. Just look at this cruise ship with nearly 3,000 people on it, if you want to see the commercial activity and compare that to the sensitivity of my subsistence-dependent Native people whose lives are at risk as a consequence of not having an opportunity to pursue their traditional resources and their appeal to you and me for relief. 
   I have no further statements. I yield the floor. 
   Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, a good deal has been said in the last several days concerning our potential involvement as part of a NATO peacekeeping operation in Kosovo. Having had an opportunity to be briefed on several occasions by the Administration, I am concerned that we have not given enough consideration to what we will do if the initial plan fails, or is somehow miscalculated. 
   Further, I am astonished that we do not have an end game for this exposure of our young men and women whom we would send into battle. As we consider the consequences of involvement in the Kosovo matter, and my sympathy runs deep for those who are in harms way as a consequence of this continued conflict, I am terribly concerned for the American lives which would be in harms way if we send troops to Kosovo. I just don't think we can continue to be all things to all people. 
   There are certain times when we have to evaluate what is our appropriate role and when it is time to rally our allies in an efficient, effective coalition of support, of access, of supplies, some way short of a conflict. 
   When one looks at the armaments over there, we find Russian, we find Chinese, we find U.S., and we find European. As a consequence, had we taken steps some time ago to ensure that this sophisticated weaponry would not fall into irresponsible hands, we might have been able to avoid it. But we are down to a time when the administration obviously is reluctant to admit that, indeed, we are at the brink of entering into a war. 
   Some have suggested it could be the beginning of World War III. I am not going to dramatize, but do want to emphasize that I do not believe that we have given sufficient attention and strategic analysis to the alternatives to intervention, or to a withdrawal plan should we proceed to send troops to Kosovo. As a consequence, this Senator is not prepared to support an action at this time. I think the President of the United States owes it to the country, as well as to Congress, to come before the body with a clear-cut, committed plan that addresses the questions I have asked this morning. 
   I, as one Senator, want to put the White House on notice that support from this Senator from Alaska, at this time, is not there. 
   I also want to emphasize another point, Mr. President, concerning our potential intervention in Kosovo. We are about to enter into a recess at the end of next week and will not reconvene as a body until sometime in mid-April. Any action by the administration to send our troops, as a part of a NATO operation, into action during our absence, obviously puts the Congress in the position of having to support our troops--while we may not necessarily support the underlying action. Of course, we will want to support our troops, and we will support our troops. 
   But, because of the timing, we as a Congress must decide now--before our troops go in--whether or not we support this intervention. I encourage Members to express their opinions now, in fact plead that Members go on record with this issue, before we are asked to support our troops in Kosovo. 
   Mr. President, I see no other Member wishing to be recognized. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 257, the National Missile Defense Act of 1999. This is an extremely important initiative, which really goes to the heart of our national security policy. The bill simply declares that it is the policy of the United States to deploy, as soon as technologically possible, a national missile defense system which is capable of protecting the entire territory of the United States from a limited ballistic missile attack. 
   Why is this important? For one, because most Americans mistakenly believe that we already have a system in place which can intercept and shoot down incoming missiles. We do not. While we can, in some instances, tell in advance if an adversary is likely to launch a ballistic missile strike at the United States, our ability to thwart the attack is limited to diplomatic efforts or, alternatively, to a quick strike military capability of our own. 
   In the case of an unauthorized or accidental missile strike, we have no deterrent capability. Imagine the horror, Mr. President, of knowing a missile strike against an American city was underway and there was nothing we could do to stop it. 
   This is the same bill that Senate Democrats filibustered twice during the 105th Congress. So, why the change of heart? I think that the main reason is that they can no longer sustain the argument that we do not face a threat credible enough to justify deployment of a national missile defense system. They now acknowledge that we face a number of real threats from many different parts of the globe. Most of these threats are the byproduct of 6 years of flawed administration foreign policy initiatives which have actually increased, not decreased, the likelihood of the post-cold-war threat. 
   What are the threats that we currently face? China comes to mind. While I for one do not consider China an adversary, I am particularly concerned by the wide range of espionage allegations connected to China. First, our military experts believe that China's missile guidance capabilities were enhanced significantly by the Loral/Hughes incidents. And more recently, there are chilling allegations that China has stolen some of our most closely held secrets on miniaturizing warhead technology, thereby exponentially increasing the threat that China poses to the United States and many of our key allies in the Asia/Pacific theater. 
   Last summer, it was widely reported that 13 of China's 18 long-range strategic missiles are armed with nuclear warheads and targeted at American cities. What's more Chinese officials have suggested that we would never support Taiwan in a crisis ``because the United States cares more about Los Angeles than it does Taipei.'' If this type of declaration, on its own, is not justification for deploying a national missile defense system, Mr. President, than nothing is. 
   Let's examine the case of North Korea. This is a country which continues to defy rational behavior, and which seems to be encouraged by this administration's bankrupt North Korea policy. Just yesterday, Secretary Albright announced that the United States would pay North Korea hundreds of millions in food aid to gain access to an underground facility north of Pyong Yong which we believe is connected to their nuclear regime. Plain and simple bribery at it's best. 
   Last year, North Korea fired a multi-stage missile over Japan. No warning and unprovoked. Why? Presumably to show that they have the capability. 
   Iran and Iraq speak for themselves. Additional concerns are the inability of the former Soviet Republics to keep good track of the ICBM's which they inherited from the breakup of the Soviet Union. Be it accidental or deliberate, if these weapons fall into the wrong hands, we will have new foreign policy concerns the likes which none of us have ever seen or will care to address. 
   We are vulnerable, Mr. President, and we need to act to prevent a catastrophe of horrific proportions. The best way to do this is to do what should have been done long ago--deploy a national missile defense system. 
   There are a number of ballistic missile defense programs at various stages of development. Ideally, the United States would pursue a dual track system, namely a sea-based system which could be deployed to various theaters as the need arises. The aim here being to protect our troops and allies which may be at the front line of a confrontation. And a ground based system based in Alaska, which is the only place in all the United States from which true, 100 percent protection of all the United States and her territories can be achieved. 
   By basing a system in Alaska, we will have the added advantage of being close to both the Asian and European theaters. Our aim should be not only to intercept a launched missile, but in being able to intercept it in the still early stages--preferably while it is still over the territory of the aggressor country. 
   As many of my colleagues are aware, we have 80,000 American troops in the Asia/Pacific theater alone. Many of these troops are already well within the range of current North Korean missile capability. As their missile development program advances, we can expect American lives and American soil to be exponentially at risk. We simply cannot stand idly by and wait. We need to be prepared, so that we can protect the American people from such a strike, be it deliberate, unauthorized or accidental. 
   Finally, Mr. President, there are those who argue that S. 257 should be  rejected because it sends the wrong signal to Russia and raises flags about the future of the ABM Treaty. Let me say unequivocally that this is not about Russia, and the Russians know it! The ABM Treaty was a product of a different era, an age when the United States and the Soviet Union were alone in their ability to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles. This age passed quickly with the breakup of the Soviet Union, and a much more unsettling world has been left in her place. Today, there are many, many threats and ignoring them will not make them go away. 
   This is not about Russia. This is about the United States and our constitutional and moral duty to protect the people whom we have been elected to represent. Mr. President, I strongly support this measure and commend Senators COCHRAN and INOUYE for their untiring efforts to see that this bill becomes law.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wish the Presiding Officer a pleasant afternoon. 
   I thank my colleague, Senator CRAIG, for his statement relative to the reality that 22 percent of the Nation's power is generated by nuclear energy. 
   Here we are again today, Mr. President, with an obligation to fulfill a commitment. That obligation and that commitment was made to the ratepayers, the individuals all over America who depend on nuclear energy for their power. They paid $14 billion over the last 18 years. 
   What have they paid for? They have paid the Federal Government to take the waste under contract in the year 1998. That was a year ago. Shakespeare wrote in Henry III, ``Delays have dangerous ends.......'' We might also add, ``expensive ends.'' 
   In addition to what the ratepayers have paid, there has been over $6 billion expended by the Federal Government in preparation for the waste primarily at Yucca Mountain. Delay has been the administration's answer to the problem of what to do with nuclear waste in this country. This administration simply doesn't want to take it up on its watch under any terms or circumstances. 
   In 1997, the administration objected to siting a temporary storage facility before 1998 when the viability assessment for Yucca Mountain would be complete. 
   The so-called ``dangerous ends'' to that delay is that 1998 has come and gone. The viability assessment was presented and 
   guess what? There were no show stoppers. Safety issues requiring that we abandon the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository project were not called for. The next step, of course, is to move on with the licensing, which is to take place in the year 2001. 
   What is the delay this year? It is the inability of the administration to recognize its contractual commitment under the agreement. To his credit, the new Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson has come forward with the first ever--and I mean first ever--administration proposal on nuclear waste. The Department of Energy would assume ownership of the used nuclear fuel and continue storing it at its commercial and defense sites in the 41 States across the country. The cost of the storage would be offset by consumer fees collected by the Department of Energy over the past 18 years, as I have stated. These are fees that were to have been dedicated to the removal and permanent storage of the spent fuel. 
   While this proposal may seem interesting, let's reflect on it a little bit, because what it means is that there is no date certain to remove the waste. The waste would sit onsite near the reactors. 
   It seems that we have gone full cycle in one sense. If you recognize that the Government had contracted to take the waste in 1998, the court has specifically stated that the Federal Government is liable to take that waste. So the court says, in effect, the Federal Government owns the waste onsite. 
   The proposal is the Government take the waste onsite. In fact, it owns the waste anyway. Think about it. There is a duplication, of course. I have a map here that I think warrants a little consideration. It shows some of the sites where we have nuclear fuel and radioactive waste that is destined for the geologic disposal. 
   The commercial reactors are in brown in California, in Washington, in Arizona, in Texas, up and down the east coast, in Illinois. 
   We have the shutdown reactors with the spent fuel onsite. These are the little triangles. We have them in Oregon, California, and Illinois. We have them in Michigan. This is significant amounts of waste that would go to a central repository at Yucca Mountain if this administration would come to grips with its responsibility. 
   Commercial spent nuclear fuel storage facilities are depicted by the little black squares. There are a few of them around. 
   Non-DOE research reactors. These are reactors that are spread through the country. 
   Then we have the Navy reactor fuel in Idaho. And we have the Department of Energy-owned spent fuel, high-level radioactive waste in New Mexico. 
   We have this all around the country, Mr. President, and the whole purpose of this legislation is to provide for and put this waste in one central repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada where it would be retrievable. As a consequence, as we look at this proposal--and, again, I would like to point out there is no date for removal--one of the more interesting things is that there are claims now brought about by the nuclear industry against the Federal Government for nonperformance of its contract. Those claims total somewhere between $60 billion and $80 billion. 
   The Government is in default for nonperformance of its contractual obligation. One of the proposals circulated  is if the Government agrees to take the waste onsite, that those claims be dropped. If you think about this a little bit more, the Government has already collected a significant amount of money from the ratepayers over the last 18 years, some $14 billion. Now the Government is going to take this waste and use that money, paid for by the ratepayers, to store the nuclear waste onsite for no timeframe that can be ascertained. 
   In other words, this waste is going to sit where it is, Mr. President. We do not know how long because there is no definite date in the proposal for the administration to take the waste. 
   So what have we done? We have simply gone full circle. The court said the Federal Government owned the waste. The Federal Government says they will take it and store it at site. They will not tell you when they are going to get rid of it. They use the money the ratepayers pay to store it there. I don't think that is satisfactory. It is a little different. It is acknowledging that they have come up with a proposal, but I do not think it is workable. 
   What we have here is, if you will, more delay. The Department of Energy--and really it is not the Department of Energy's fault--it is the administration that has broken its promise to the electric consumers, who depend on nuclear energy, people who have paid more than $14 billion to the Federal Government. 
   That $14 billion paid by consumers was designed specifically to remove this waste, Mr. President, to a single--a single--storage facility at Yucca Mountain. And that is what we have been building. The waste, again, was supposed to be taken in the year 1998. 
   Where have we been over the past 15 years? We have done nothing but slip the schedule on nuclear waste. First it was to have this waste removed by the year 2003, then 2005, then 2010, now 2015. With this proposal that I have just mentioned, that is in draft form, they are proposing it go back to 2010. Maybe that is progress; I don't know. Through it all, the nuclear ratepayers have paid the bill, but we are not through with the cost. 
   As I have indicated previously, the U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled the Department of Energy had an obligation to take possession of the waste in 1998, whether or not a repository was ready. The court ordered the Department of Energy to pay contractual remedies. This is a pretty big hit on the Federal Government and, hence, the taxpayer, Mr. President. 
   Estimates of damages range as high as $40, $50, $60--up to $80 billion. How do the damages break down? Here they are: the cost of storage of spent nuclear fuel, $19.6 billion; return of nuclear waste fees, $8.5 billion; interest on nuclear waste fees, $15 to $27.8 billion; consequential damages for shutdown of 25 percent of nuclear plants due to insufficient storage--these are power replacement costs--$24 billion. 
   That is a pretty disastrous scenario for the consumers. It would add, if you will, the high cost of replacement power if these reactors go down as a consequence of not being able to basically remove their waste. There is loss of emissions, a free source of electric energy if the nuclear plants are forced to close. And again, I would remind you that 22 percent of our total electric power is generated from nuclear energy. 
   These costs, these ``dangerous ends'' can be fixed. It is really time for the administration to stop trying out bats, if you will, and step up to the plate on its obligation. So today I once again, along with Senator CRAIG, and a number of my colleagues, Senator GRAMS, are introducing the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to solve our immediate liability problems by establishing an interim nuclear waste facility at the Nevada test site. 
   Why the Nevada test site? Over the last 50 years, we have tested nuclear bombs, nuclear weapons in that area numerous times. As a consequence, it appears, and was selected, to be the best site for a permanent repository. 
   What we are proposing, by this legislation, is to move this waste out and put it at site, but have it retrievable so when the permanent repository is ready it can be placed there. In the meantime, we will remove the waste from some 70 sites around the country. 
   In addition, this measure improves the process towards a permanent nuclear waste repository by making sure that funding is adequate and that the process to reach that goal is sound and viable? 
   While my committee will examine the proposal put forth by the Secretary, there is some circular reasoning inherent in it. 
   One, the administration's arguments to date have been that building an interim storage facility would divert funds from the study of the proposed permanent repository. But the Secretary's proposal for continued onsite storage would do just that. It would redirect consumer funds to pay for continued onsite storage. 
   Do we really want this nuclear waste piling up at 71 sites around the Nation rather than one? That is the critical question, Mr. President. Here is the proposed site for the nuclear waste--out in the Nevada desert. And the Nevada test site was previously used for more than 800 nuclear weapons tests. There it is. 
   There is some conversation that suggests, What if the current repository at Yucca Mountain does not prove to be licensable, what will you do with it then? Obviously, we will have to address that. But in the meantime, we would concentrate 
   it out in this area in retrievable casks that would allow us to move it someplace for permanent storage. Or there is the technology that is developing on reprocessing that the Japanese and the French have proceeded with, which is to recover the plutonium out of the spent nuclear fuel and put it back in the reactors. That is another alternative. 
   So the alternative to leaving it at the 71 sites, vis-a-vis putting it out in one place where we have had over 800 nuclear tests over the past 50 years, obviously is a logical and reasonable progression to remove this from the various sites around the United States. 
   Finally, Mr. President, the time for delay is long past. We have had enough delay now. In the last Congress, we had a vote on this matter. It was overwhelmingly bipartisan. There were 65 Members of the U.S. Senate that voted yes--that voted yes--to put the waste in a temporary retrievable repository at Yucca Mountain. In the House there were 307 Members that voted yes. 
   Obviously the time is now at hand to move this bill out, to meet the responsibility that we have committed to with the ratepayers over these last 18 years and take that $14 billion and move this waste out to the Nevada test site once and for all until the permanent repository is licensed. 
   So, Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to reflect on the merits of this bill--the debate went on in the last Congress--and recognize that we simply cannot put our heads in the sand and ignore this. This is a contract commitment. You have to recognize the sanctity of that contract and the recognition of 22 percent of our power is from nuclear energy, and if we are to allow this industry to strangle on its high-level waste, we are doing a great disservice and simply are going to have to come up with power sources from other generating capabilities that do not offer the air quality that is available by nuclear energy. 
   As we look at global warming and greenhouse gases and various legislative proposals by the administration, the role of nuclear energy is noticeably absent. I think that is unfortunate as we recognize that nuclear energy contributes to reducing greenhouse gases and hence global warming.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will help fight a silent epidemic among America's youth. This epidemic can leave young people permanently brain damaged, and in some cases even dead. It is called inhalant abuse. An awful lot of attention goes to substance abuse--alcohol, drugs--but very little attention is being given to inhalant abuse. It seems to be the silent killer.  I ask that the bill be introduced pursuant to Senate rule 14 and be placed immediately on the Calendar. 
   My bill amends the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1994 to include inhalant abuse among the act's definition of ``abused substances,'' thereby allowing schools the option to educate students about the horrors of inhalant abuse. 
   What exactly are inhalants? What are we talking about? Inhalants are the intentional breathing of gas or vapors for the purpose of getting a high. Over 1,400 common products can be abused--lighter fluid, pressurized whipped cream, hair spray; gasoline is often used in my rural State of Alaska. These products are inexpensive, they are easily obtained, and, most of all, they are legal. One inhalant abuse counselor told me, ``If it smells like a chemical, it can be abused.'' 
   It is a silent epidemic because few adults appreciate the severity of the problem or how often it occurs. It is estimated one in five students have tried inhalants by the time they reach the eighth grade. The use of inhalants by children has nearly doubled in the last 10 years. Inhalants are the third most abused substance among teenagers, behind alcohol and tobacco. 
   Inhalants are deadly. Inhalant vapors react with fatty tissues of the brain and literally dissolve those tissues. A one-time use of inhalants can cause instant and permanent brain damage, heart failure, kidney failure, liver failure, or death. The user can also suffer instant heart failure. This is known as sudden sniffing death syndrome. This means an abuser can die on the very first time he or she tries it or the 10th time or the 100th time that an individual sees fit to use an inhalant. In fact, according to a recent study by the National Native Health Consortium, ``inhaling has a higher risk of `instant death' than any other abused substance.'' Think of that: Inhalants have a higher risk of instant death, the first time, than any other abused substance. 
   That is what happened last year to Theresa, an 18-year-old who lived in a rural western Alaska village. Last year Theresa was inhaling gasoline; shortly thereafter, her heart stopped. She was found outside in the near-zero temperature. Theresa was the youngest of five children and just a month shy of graduation. She was flown to the Fairbanks Memorial Hospital where she was pronounced dead on arrival. 
   Earlier this year in Pennsylvania, a teenaged driver with four teenaged passengers lost control of her car in broad daylight. The car hit a tree with such impact that all the passengers were killed. High levels of a chemical found in computer keyboard cleaners--think about this, computer keyboard cleaners--were found in the young driver's body. The medical examiner report cited impairment due to inhalant abuse as the cause of that crash. 
   Mr. Haviland, the principal of the school that the five girls attended, said the teacher never suspected that the students were involved with inhalants. That is why this bill is so important. The most effective prevention against inhalant abuse is education. It is preventable. But educators must first know about inhalants before they can teach our kids of their dangers. 
   My bill will amend section 4131 of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act to allow States and communities the option to develop programs on inhalant abuse. Under my amendment, the principals, teachers, and counselors will be able to learn about inhalants and will have the option to develop educational programs to teach about inhalant abuse. 
   There is no cost associated with this legislation. This bill makes fiscal sense. A 1993 study by the Alaska Indian Health Service revealed that a 19-year-old chronic inhalant abuser could have an average lifetime cost of up to $1.4 million. These are the costs of chronic medical care, substance abuse treatment, rehabilitation treatment, and social services. The costs go on and on. We can save those costs if we just prevent this type of abuse. 
   The goal of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act is to save the lives of young people, but currently only illegal drugs, alcohol, and tobacco are covered under the definitions of this act. This bill will help us solve the problem and save the lives of our youth. We support this legislation.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce with my distinguished colleague from Maine, Senator COLLINS, the Graduate Medical Education Technical Amendments Act of 1999. This legislation will alleviate unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 regarding Graduate Medical Education (GME). 
   The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 contained important and necessary GME reform. However, a small number of the changes in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, have grave consequences for many residency programs, particularly for programs that have been training in ambulatory settings, are small, or who produce physicians to serve in rural areas. The impact has been disproportionately harmful to programs that: have already been training in ambulatory settings (because the hospitals in which they were located were not allowed to count the residents they had serving in community settings in the cap); are small, such as hospitals with only one residency program; and train physicians for practice in rural areas. 
   The impact is especially damaging to family practice residency programs. Only family practice residents have been trained extensively out of the hospital and only family practice residencies were significantly harmed by this provision in the BBA. In fact, a recent survey indicates that 56 percent of family residency program directors believe that the BBA provisions will preclude their development of rural training sites. 
   Senator COLLINS' and my legislation would include the following legislative remedies: 
   Recalculate the IME and DME caps based on the number of interns and residents who were appointed by the approved medical residency training programs for FY 1996, whether they were being trained in the hospital or in the community; 
   Change the cutoff date for adjusting the DME funding cap to September 30, 1999, to allow those programs already in the approval process for accreditation to continue to realization; and 
   Expand the exception to the funding caps to include programs with separately accredited rural training tracks even if the sponsoring hospital is not located in a rural area, and for residency programs where a primary care training program is the only one offered in the hospital. 
   This legislation is important for Alaska's first and only residency program. The Alaska Family Practice Residency is specifically designed to train physicians to practice medicine in rural Alaska. 
   Alaska's rural health care problems are tough: 74% of Alaska is medically under-served. Many villages populated by 25-1000 individuals do not have access to physicians. Physician turn-over rate is high which makes it impossible for patients to establish long-term relationships with their physician to manage chronic disease or to do preventative medicine. The result is that bush Alaska has much higher rates of preventable diseases. 
   This legislation is truly imperative to Alaska health care. While other residency programs have the luxury of educating their residents on rural health issues, for us it is a necessity. 
   Mr. President, our legislation corrects a small deficiency in the BBA of 1997 that has had a large, unintended impact on programs training community-based and rural doctors. I hope my colleagues can join our efforts and support this important legislation.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am today introducing--together with my good friend Senator STEVENS--new legislation to ensure that the marine waters of Glacier Bay National Park remain open to the fisheries that have been conducted there for many, many years. 
   For a number of years, the Park Service has attempted to seize authority over fisheries management in Glacier Bay from the State of Alaska, which holds title to the marine waters and submerged lands within Glacier Bay National Park. This is an infringement of the State's sovereignty under the constitutional doctrine of equal footing, as confirmed by Congress in the Submerged Lands Act, and the Alaska Statehood Act. 
   As my colleagues should all be aware, commercial fisheries have been conducted in these waters for well over 100 years, since long before the federal government became interested in them. Subsistence fishing and gathering by local residents has been practiced for up to 9,000 years, and perhaps longer. 
   Yet today, officials of the National Park Service want Glacier Bay off limits to those who have depended on it for their sustenance and livelihoods for generations. 
   Most recently, agents of the Park Service harassed a number of commercial crab fishermen who were fishing in areas which have always been open to them. Some of these were areas which may be closed under legislation adopted last year, but for which the Park Service has not yet promulgated regulations to effect the closure. 
   Although Park Service officials now say they merely asked for voluntary compliance and attempted to educate fishermen about their plans, the fishermen tell a different, and more sinister, story. 
   This particular crab fishery is only six days long, with the first two days being crucial to a fisherman's financial success. Because of this, fishermen must work literally around the clock for the first 48 to 72 hours. After the first two days, their earning potential--even for a top fisherman--drops from almost $60,000 per day to less than $20,000. 
   It is important to note that these are not large scale fisheries. We are talking about a small handful of fishermen, some working solely with their families. 
   Out of the 14 vessels working in the Bay during the recent fishery, 11 were boarded--right in the middle of those crucial first two days--by armed and intimidating Park Service agents. Many were either told they were in closed waters, or threatened that if they did not move, they would be prosecuted. Needless to say, these fishermen are law-abiding members of society, so they pulled up their fishing gear and moved, taking very serious financial losses as a result. 
    Mr. President, let me ask you how difficult it would have been to write a letter before the season opened and send it to these 14 fishermen? How hard would it be to send a letter to 20 fishermen? or to 50? In other words, Mr. President, how hard would it have been to avoid such confrontational and damaging tactics? 
   It would not have been hard at all, Mr. President, and the fact that the agency did not choose to do so is just one more example of how unfairly the Park Service has behaved to those who live and work in Alaska. 
   It is time for this to stop, and to ensure that it does, I am today offering a simple, clean solution. First, the bill authorizes subsistence fishing and gathering under the existing federal governing authority for such activities. Second, the bill authorizes the State of Alaska to conduct its marine fisheries without interference, except a fishery for Dungeness crab, for which a compensation plan has already been adopted. And third, the bill authorizes the use of up to $2,000,000 per year--which the Park Service is already collecting but which it has failed to use for the purpose intended by Congress--to be used to pay damages to fishermen who were unfairly harmed. 
    Mr. President, this is a matter of simple fairness. These are not new fisheries, but old ones--fisheries which throughout their long history have never caused a problem, and are today more tightly controlled than ever by State of Alaska law and regulation. 
   Fishermen have caused no harm here. The only harm has been caused either by the arrogant demands of those who want the park to themselves, or those who are well-meaning but ignorant of the facts. It is time the former become better neighbors, and time for the latter to learn the truth.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to clarify a production and printing problem that occurred with regard to the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. On January 19, 1999, I, with my distinguished colleague from the State of Washington, Senator GORTON, introduced legislation to reorganize the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Unfortunately, the legislation we introduced, S. 186, was an incorrect draft. I reintroduced the correct draft as S. 253. However, through a glitch in the publishing of the RECORD, the incorrect language of the bill was again reproduced in the RECORD. 
   The language appearing in today's record is the correct language of S. 253. This language is identical to the recommendation of the White Commission, the congressionally-mandated Commission structured to study the alignment of the U.S. Court of Appeals.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Edgar Nollner Sr., a distinguished Alaskan and notable American hero who passed away recently at his home in Galena, Alaska at the age of 94. 
   While Edgar Nollner is not a household name, many Americans may recall his heroic story of courage, teamwork and selflessness. 
   In the winter of 1925, the Gold Rush town of Nome, Alaska was in the midst of a deadly diphtheria epidemic. Several cases of the contagious, bacterial disease had struck the small predominately Native population, some 1,400 of the towns residents. 
   On January 21, an emergency Morse code message was transmitted from Nome pleading for a supply of diphtheria antitoxin serum. Twenty pounds of serum was found at an Anchorage hospital, but territorial governor Scot Bone would not risk flying the precious viles of serum from Anchorage to Fairbanks due to hazardous weather conditions. In fact, it is noted that the governor said he was willing to let the pilots risk their lives, but he would not risk the serum. Officials then determined that the serum would be shipped to Nenana via railroad; the serum arrived in the interior Alaska town six days after the initial plea was sent. It was from Nenana that the infamous 674 mile Serum Run Relay began, a race not for glory or riches, but a race to save the residents of Nome. 
   Nome typically received most of its winter supplies by dog sled with deliveries taking a single musher 15 to 20 days to make a trip. Instead of a solo run, 20 dog-sled mushers, including Edgar Nollner, prepared to tackle the 70 degree below zero temperatures, frozen tundra and gale-force winds blowing up to 75 miles and hour. The mushers and dog teams were thus divided into shorter sprint segments to quicken the trip. 
   Edgar Nollner was scheduled to run the 10th leg of the relay, 42 miles, but his younger brother, George, begged him to let him drive the last 18 miles of his leg. Edgar ran at night, covering the 24 miles from Whiskey Point to Galena in 3 hours. He reported that winds were so fierce, causing so much blowing snow, that he could not see his dogs  or anything around him. His lead sled dog and trusted friend, Dixie, knew the trail and never faltered. 
   The frozen serum arrived safely in Nome on February 2, 1925, in a mere 5 days and 7 hours; the epidemic was soon over. The brave men and scores of dogs were all hailed heroes. But for all the acclaim it received, the serum run marked the end of an era. With the increase of better airplanes, better schedules, and the insurgence of snow machines, the need for dog sleds was no longer essential. If the fear of diphtheria now seems antiquated, it is only because the Serum Run brought an end to the disease as a serious health threat in the United States. 
   Edgar Nollner was just 20 years old when he left his trapper and fisherman lifestyle to selflessly join the others on the Serun Run. He was the son of a Missouri man who came to Alaska for the 1890's Gold Rush, and an Athabaskan mother, who made their home along the Yukon River in Galena. As the last surviving member of the serum-run relay mushers who risked their lives so that others may live, Edgar Nollner was truly a twentieth century hero. 
   The townspeople in Galena are mourning Edgar's passing but his legacy remains. Records show that Mr. Nollner married twice, fathered 24 children and has more than 200 grandchildren and great grandchildren. Mr. President, I believe there can be no greater gift. 
   To honor these brave men, the famous Serum Run Relay was reenacted in 1973, in an event know known as the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. The modern-day Iditarod covers more than 1,000 miles of frozen tundra from Anchorage to Nome and is now run annually in March. 
   Edgar Nollner was both a hero and legend. I salute this rugged Alaskan who risked his life so that others could live--he epitomizes the true spirit of all Alaskans. His spirit, along with the 19 other brave Serum Run mushers will continue to run strong in every Iditarod. The final chapter of this dramatic saga is closed, but not forgotten.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the second of two bills of which passed the Senate last year with unanimous consent. The first bill which was introduced on February 12, 1999, amends the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), to provide for a land exchange between the Secretary of Agriculture and the Huna Totem Corporation, a village corporation created under that Act. The second bill provides for a similar land exchange between the Secretary and the Kake Tribal Corporation. Both of these bills will allow the Kake Tribal and Huna Totem Corporations to convey land needed as municipal watersheds in their surrounding communities to the Secretary in exchange for other Forest Service lands. 
   Enactment of these bills will meet two objectives. First, the two corporations will finally be able to fully recognize the economic benefits promised to them under ANCSA. Second, the watersheds that supply the communities of Hoonah, Alaska and Kake, Alaska will be protected in order to provide safe water for those communities. 
   The legislation I offer today clarifies several issues that were raised during the Committee hearings and mark-up last year. First, the legislation directs that the subsurface estates owned by Sealaska Corporation in the Huna and Kake exchange lands are exchanged for similar subsurface estates in the conveyed Forest Service lands. Second the substitute clarifies that these exchanges are to be done on an equal value basis. Both the Secretary of Agriculture and the corporations insisted on this provision. I believe this is critical, Mr. President, because both these bills provide that any timber derived from the newly acquired Corporation lands be processed in-state, a requirement that does not currently exist on the watershed lands the corporations are exchanging. Therefore, if this exchange simply were done on an acre-for-acre basis it is likely that the acreage the corporations are exchanging, without any timber export restrictions, would have a much higher value than what they would get in return. It is for this reason that these exchanges will not be done on an acre-for-acre basis. If it ends up that either party has to receive additional compensation, either in additional lands or in cash to equalize the value, then it is my hope this will be done in an expeditious way to allow the exchange to move forward within the times specified in the legislation. 
   I believe these two pieces of legislation are in the best interest of the native corporations, the Alaska communities where the watersheds are located, and the Federal government. It is my intention to try and pass these bills out of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee at the earliest opportunity.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. Chief Justice, it seems to be a prerequisite to speak today for Senators to indicate the number of grandchildren each has. I am proud to say Nancy and I have 11, but I won't indulge you with naming each of them. 
   I along with all of you will soon cast our votes on the Articles of Impeachment that have been presented against President Clinton. With the exception of voting on a declaration of war, I can think of no more serious vote that a Senator will cast in his or her lifetime than on removing a President from office. History may or may not tell which vote is correct. 
   We have deliberated more than 67 hours. Five weeks ago, we met in the old Senate Chamber and on a 100-0 vote departed on a course of action to resolve this matter. The House Managers presented the case against the President. White House counsel presented their defense and then Senators spent two days submitting questions to both sides. We then resolved the question of witnesses by allowing the use of videotapes, and heard final arguments from both sides on Monday. For the past two days, Senators have offered their statements on this matter and we are on target to reach a final vote on the two Articles in less than 48 hours. That's our Constitutional duty. I am proud and honored to have participated in this historical deliberation and respect each of you and your words. 
   There are several recollections about the facts in this case that trouble me. Perhaps it is because I am not a lawyer. 
   In Ms. Lewinsky's testimony, she indicated that on the first day she met the President, she was wearing a pink identification tag which provides limited access to the White House. The President reached out and held it and said: ``Well, this could be a problem'' or words to that effect. That tells us something about the President's character. 
   Furthermore, after the Lewinsky story broke in the press, the President had Dick Morris conduct a poll and when Morris told the President that the public would forgive him for adultery but not for perjury or obstruction of justice, the President responded: ``We will just have to win then.'' That tells me something else about the President. 
   It should also be noted that we would not be here if Ms. Lewinsky had not kept the blue dress which contained the DNA evidence implicating the President beyond a doubt. Without that dress, it would be an old story of ``He said/She said.'' Think about that. 
   Finally, we are all held accountable for our actions. But the President refuses to be held accountable. And I have a problem with the repeated reference from the First Lady that the President ministers to troubled people, suggesting that Monica Lewinsky was such a person. 
   What has been happening, not just here in Washington, but all around the country is something far more disturbing than the trial of a President. What we have been witnessing is a contest for the very moral soul of the United States of America--and that the great casualty so far of the national scandal is the notion of Truth. 
   Truth has been shown to us as an elastic commodity. 
   It has been said that this trial is not about the partisan political gamesmanship between the President's Democratic supporters and the Republican forces on the other side, as the media would have you think. 
   Indeed one pundit said that more Americans get their ideas and reactions of the impeachment process from Jay Leno than they do from CNN. 
   The polls show Americans favoring leaving the President in office while they say Republicans appear bent on political suicide. 
   It has been said that Republicans see accountability, discipline and punishment as fundamental to the very structure of American society and that the President ought to be the ``stern father'' image and a figure of moral authority. 
   Clinton's liberal supporters model American society on the ``nurturing parent'' concept. To them, the Presidency is less a figure of moral authority than a helpful and powerful friend capable of doing good. 
   Where were you when former President Nixon resigned? I wondered at the time whether the republic would survive Watergate. We did survive and many believe we are a stronger nation because of that process. 
   In reaching a judgment in this case, I have reviewed the evidence presented  by the House Managers and the able defense offered by the President's counsel. I have concluded that the President is guilty on both Articles and that the two Articles more than satisfy the Constitutional standard of high crimes and misdemeanors. 
   I believe the President should be removed from office not because he engaged in irresponsible, reckless, and reprehensible conduct in the Oval Office with a White House intern. He should be removed from office because he engaged in conduct designed to undermine the foundation, the very bedrock, of the concept of due process of law and, by extension, the very notion of the rule of law. 
   There is no question in my mind that President Clinton intentionally provided false and misleading testimony and committed perjury before the Grand Jury when he told the Grand Jury he was ``trying to figure out what the facts were'' when he made the following statements to his Secretary Betty Currie the day after his civil deposition testimony: 
   ``I was never really alone with Monica, right?'' 
   ``You were always there when Monica was there, right?'' 
   ``Monica came on to me, and I never touched her, right?'' 
   ``She wanted to have sex with me, and I cannot do that.'' 
   Mr. Chief Justice, it is just not credible to believe that these statements were designed to help the President elicit facts since he, and not Betty Currie, knew precisely the type of indiscreet activities he and Monica Lewinsky had engaged in. To believe his testimony, one would have to assume the unbelievable--that the President engaged in these acts with Ms. Lewinsky in the full expectation that Ms. Currie witnessed them. 
   It is only reasonable to assume that the President's statements to Ms. Currie, made on more than one occasion (twice), were designed for one, and only one simple purpose: to coach and influence her future testimony. He was clearly seeking to undermine judicial proceedings by encouraging her to lie under oath for the single purpose of protecting him. His conduct not only amounts to false testimony, but provides a clear basis to conclude that the President sought to obstruct justice. 
   Moreover, it is undisputed that gifts the President gave to Monica Lewinsky, gifts that were subpoenaed in the civil suit against the President, were removed from Ms. Lewinsky's possession and hidden under Betty Currie's bed. There is no rational reason that Ms. Currie, on her own, decided to seek the return of the gifts. The only inference that a reasonable person could conclude is that the President asked Ms. Currie to retrieve the gifts in an effort to conceal evidence from the court; evidence that was clearly relevant in the civil case. 
   The House Managers have presented a credible case showing that the President increased the pressure on his friend, Vernon Jordan, to obtain a private sector job for Ms. Lewinsky when she was named as a potential witness in the civil case brought against the President. It was not a coincidence of events, but rather a concerted effort by the President to secure employment for Ms. Lewinsky to ensure an affidavit that did not harm his interests. Mr. Jordan is not at fault; he was merely a pawn in the President's strategy to obstruct justice by encouraging the submission of a false affidavit from Ms. Lewinsky. 
   Mr. Chief Justice, the charges against the President concern perjury, witness tampering, and concealing of evidence. These offenses clearly rise to the level of obstructing justice in the same sense that bribing a witness to testify falsely or destroying evidence amount to obstruction of justice. 
   Today, there are 115 people incarcerated in federal prisons because they were convicted of perjury. On Saturday, we heard the videotape testimony of Dr. Barbara Battalino who had been an attorney and a VA doctor. Her crime? She lied about sex under oath in a civil proceeding. Her penalty? She lost her medical license. She lost her right to practice law. She was fired from her job. The Clinton Justice Department prosecuted her for perjury and she was sentenced to 6 months of imprisonment under electronic monitoring and paid a $3,500 fine. 
   Should not the standard applied to Dr. Battalino apply to the President of the United States who swore an oath to ``preserve, protect and defend the Constitution,'' when he entered office and who swore an oath to tell the truth when he testified before the Grand Jury? Or should we condone the standard the President suggested in his Grand Jury testimony, when he testified that he ``said things that were true, that may have been misleading?'' Think about that statement! 
   Mr. Chief Justice, the foundation of our republic is that we are a nation governed by laws, not by men. For the rule of law to be maintained, there must be a credible system of justice. Any effort to undermine the integrity of the judicial system subverts the principle of a nation of laws. And that system of justice depends for it very survival on maintaining the integrity of the oath that a person swears to tell the truth. Otherwise, if we turn a blind eye and allow people to lie under oath, destroy or hide evidence, or conspire to present false and misleading testimony, the entire notion of justice and truth become meaningless. 
   The President's counsel on Monday asked the question: ``Would it put at risk the liberty of the people to retain the President in office?'' Unfortunately, I believe the answer is yes. The right of an individual to a fair trial is endangered when the President of the United States remains in office having undermined the rule of law by obstructing justice and committing perjury. 
   Why should a citizen tell the truth in a court room when it does not serve his interest if the President is allowed to perjure himself because it does not serve his interest? 
   Why should an individual not try to influence the testimony of a witness, when the President suffers no adverse consequences when he seeks to influence the testimony of a witness? 
   Does anyone in this chamber believe that obstruction of justice is not a high crime and misdemeanor? Does anyone in this chamber believe that President Clinton did not attempt to obstruct justice? If your answer to those questions is in the affirmative, I believe you must, I repeat, you must vote to convict and remove the President. That is the mandate of the Constitution. 
   Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution provides the President. ..... shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other High Crimes and Misdemeanors. 
   There is nothing in the Constitution that says that a President with a high popularity rating shall not be removed if convicted. The Framers believed that it was so important to rid the government of officials convicted for such offenses that the Framers gave us no latitude on the question of removal from office. 
   Mr. Chief Justice, the nation has endured more than a year of what started as a scandal and turned into an obstruction of justice and an impeachment. Again, had there been no DNA evidence, Ms. Lewinsky would have been smeared in the press as a stalker and this case would be closed. 
   I hope my colleagues in good conscience can put party aside and uphold the oath we took a month ago to be impartial in our judgment of President Clinton. This is a sad day for our contemporary country but a magnificent day for the Founders who recognized that no man is above the law and gave us the tools to remove those who violate the public trust.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I concur with my colleagues. Implementation of the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments is creating a real need to develop clean alternative fuels. 
   For example, of the 64 remaining U.S. coke batteries, 58 are subject to closure as a result of the Clean Air Act. The steel industry can either use limited capital to build new clean coking facilities or they can choose to import coke from China, which uses 50 year old highly pollutant technologies. Restoring the section 29 credit to encourage cleaner coker technologies will greatly reduce emissions and will slow our increasing dependence on foreign coke, at the same time creating jobs in the United States in both the steel and coal mining industries. 
   In addition, the United States has rich deposits of lignite and sub-bituminous coals. There are new technologies that can upgrade these coals to make them burn efficiently and economically, while at the same time significantly reducing air pollution. 
   This is proven technology, but to make the development of this technology throughout the nation feasible, the Congress needs to provide tax incentives.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am today introducing legislation to allow the State of Alaska to take responsibility for regulating small (5 megawatts or less) hydroelectric projects located in Alaska. This legislation is identical to section 1 of S. 439 in the 105th Congress, which was reported unanimously by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and was passed unanimously by the Senate. Unfortunately, because the Senate passed the legislation late in the session, the House did not have time to act before Congress adjourned. 
   Let me describe why this legislation is needed. Simply put, FERC's licensing process is too expensive and too cumbersome for many small hydroelectric projects in Alaska. For a large project costing tens or hundreds of millions of dollars the burden of obtaining a FERC license is large, but relatively small as compared to the total cost. However, for a small project located in a remote region of Alaska, FERC's licensing process is a major problem. All  too often, the burden of the licensing process alone dooms an otherwise economically viable and environmentally beneficial project. And those small hydro projects it does not doom, FERC's process increases significantly their cost--which is just passed on to consumers in terms of higher electricity rates. 
   For other States this may not be very significant, but it is for Alaska. Alaska already has the most expensive electricity in the United States. Alaska's average residential price of electricity is 36 percent higher than the U.S. average, and in some parts of Alaska the residential price reaches a stunning 43 cents per kilowatt hour--5 times the U.S. average. Why so expensive? Primarily because it is produced by diesel generators, which are both relatively inefficient and use expensive fuel. Compared to diesel generators, hydroelectric power is much less expensive. 
   It is important to note that hydroelectric power is much more environmentally benign as compared to diesel-fired generation: Hydroelectric generation produces no air emissions as does diesel-fired generation. Thus, anything we can do to promote the construction of hydroelectric projects will also help the environment of Alaska. 
   In this connection, it is also important to note that this legislation does not exempt Alaska's small hydro projects from regulation. Instead, it allows the State of Alaska to regulate in lieu of FERC. I ask: Who is more interested in the environment of Alaska--Alaskans or a distant FERC? Moreover, the legislation allows Alaska to regulate only after FERC has determined that the State has in place a regulatory program which ``protects the public interest ..... and the environment to the same extent provided by ..... [the FERC].'' Finally, the legislation specifically requires the full application of all ``Federal environmental, natural resources, or cultural resources protection laws. ..... '' Thus, enactment of this legislation will fully protect the environment and the public interest. 
   In summary, if enacted this legislation will benefit both Alaska's environment and its economy.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise on behalf of myself and the Majority Leader Mr. LOTT, Senator BAUCUS, Senator COCHRAN, Senator INHOFE, Senator CAMPBELL, and Senator INOUYE, to introduce legislation to permanently authorize and expand the Medicare and Medicaid direct collections demonstration program under section 405 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. 
   This Act will end much of the red tape and bureauracy for IHS facilities involved with Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, and will mean more Medicaid and Medicare dollars to Native health facilities to use for improving health care. 
   Our bill will allow Native hospitals to collect Medicare and Medicaid fund directly from the Health Care Financing Administration instead of having to go through the maze of regulations mandated by IHS. 
   This bill is an expansion of a current demonstration project that includes Bristol Bay Health Corporation of Dillingham, Alaska: the Southeast Alaska Regional Health Corporation of Sitka, Alaska; the Mississippi Choctaw Health Center of Philadelphia, Mississippi: and the Choctaw Tribe of Durant, Oklahoma. All of the participants in the demonstration program--as well as the Department of Health and Human Service and the Indian Health Services report that the program is a great success. HHS Secretary Donna Shalala stated in a letter to Senator JOHN MCCAIN on July 23, 1996, that the program has: 
   Dramatically increased collections for Medicare and Medicaid services, which in turn has provided badly-needed revenues for Indian and Alaska Native health care: 
   Sigificantly reduced the turn-around time between billing and the receipt of payment for Medicare and Medicaid services: and, 
   Increased the administrative efficiency of the participating health facilities by empowering them to track their own Medicare and Medicaid billings and collections. 
   In her letter, Secretary Shalala also mentions that the Southeast Alaska Regional Health Corporation has been able to make ``great strides in upgrading the health facilities'' as a result of increased collections brought on by its participation in the demonstration program. 
   In 1998, when the demonstration program was about to expire, Congress extended it through FY 2001. This extension has allowed the participants to continue their direct billing and collection efforts and has provided Congress with additional time to consider whether to permanently authorize the program. 
   It is time to recognize the benefits of the demonstration program by enacting legislation that would permanently authorize it and expand it to other eligible tribal participants.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, first of all, I want to raise with my colleagues two issues that revolve around energy security. The first issue is the state of the domestic oil industry and the second issue is the Oil-for-Food Program for Iraq. I think that this marks the first departure from the debate on the impeachment, and I hope the Presiding Officer will find it refreshing. 
   Last week, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which I chair, held a hearing to review the state of the domestic petroleum industry, and to assess the threat to our economic security from our growing dependence on foreign oil. The domestic oil industry in the United States is in serious trouble. Companies are laying off workers in droves. In my State of Alaska, British Petroleum, just announced the layoff of some 600 workers, and another one of our major oil companies lost somewhere in the area of just under $800 million in the last quarter of 1998. 
   Exploration and drilling budgets are way down. Drilling contractors have been cut to the bone. Marginal and stripper wells are being shut in. These are production capabilities, Mr. President, that, once lost, will unlikely be regained. These, to a large degree, represent an ongoing operating petroleum reserve--one might conclude a strategic petroleum reserve--because while they are small, they are substantial in their numbers and contribute to domestic production. 
   Now, to quote a recent report by the John S. Herold Company, 1998 was a ``catastrophe'' for the U.S. oil industry, ``nothing short of murderous for investors'' in that industry. We are seeing mergers and consolidations, significant implications for the Nation's energy security, and certainly U.S. jobs--30 merged companies alone last year. 
   This situation in the oil industry is interesting, as we look at the commodities in this country. As the Presiding Officer is well aware, the agricultural industry--production, livestock, hogs, beef--the farmers can hardly raise them anymore. Many aspects of the agricultural industry are under water. This is true of the timber industry. It is true of the steel industry. It is true of the mining industry, and certainly true of the oil and gas industry. 
   So as we reflect on the prosperity of this country, it is interesting to note the job losses in the commodities industries of this country--and one has to wonder when it is going to catch up with itself. Of course, we enjoy low gasoline prices when we fill our car or boat, low heating oil prices when we warm our home, and low inflation due in large measure to low oil prices. Let's recognize where it is. 
   But a decimated U.S. oil industry creates a risk to consumers, to the economy, to our national energy security. And we only have to look back at history. Some say we learn from history, and some say not much. Well, we recall the 1973 Arab oil embargo when we were only 36 percent dependent on foreign imported oil. That had a devastating impact on consumers and the economy. We saw oil shortages, and long lines at the gas stations. Many people have forgotten that timeframe--soaring prices, double-digit inflation, and an economy put into recession. What was the prime rate at that time? Well, the prime rate was 20.5 percent in 1980. Inflation was in the area of 11 percent--double-digit. 
   If it happened today, we could be hit even harder. And we are getting set up for it because we are in worse shape today than we were in 1973. Since 1973, our foreign dependence has grown by leaps and bounds. U.S. crude oil production dropped by one-third. U.S. oil imports--oil imports--soared by two-thirds. 
   Today, U.S. foreign oil dependence is 56 percent, compared to 36 percent back in 1973. Our excessive foreign oil dependence puts our national energy security interests at stake and hence our national security at stake. We can't forget that the United States went to war in 1991 when Iraq invaded Kuwait and threatened the world oil supplies. Part of that was our supply. 
   In 1995, President Clinton issued a Presidential finding that imports of oil threatened our national security, and a short time ago the U.S. bombed Iraq because Saddam continues to threaten the stability in the Persian Gulf. Well, it is fair to say, Mr. President, if we do nothing, what will happen: We know things are going to get worse. 
   The Department of Energy projects in the year 2010 U.S. foreign dependence will hit about 68 percent. That means we will be depending on foreign sources for 68 percent of our oil supply. 
   I don't think we should put our trust in foreign oil-producing nations that have their interests in mind, not ours. I plan to work closely with the small and independent producers to develop a solution to this crisis. Already I have cosponsored Senate bill 325, a bill introduced by my colleague from Texas, Senator KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, that would amend the Tax Code to add marginal producers. I will work as a member of the Finance Committee to consider this and see it is adopted. 
   I also intend, with Senators from producing States, to consider a non-tax means to assist domestic production through regulatory and land access issues. 
   Second, I want to talk about oil-for-food and our relations with Iraq. This deals with our energy security; that is, our U.S. policy towards Iraq, specifically, the U.N. Oil-for-Food Program. Six weeks have passed since President Clinton ordered America's Armed Forces to strike military and security targets in Iraq. What has Saddam's regime done since then? They have shot at U.S. fighter planes on almost a daily basis. They have challenged Kuwait's right to exist. They have demanded compensation for U.N. crimes against Iraq--isn't that ironic. They have demanded an end to sanctions and no-fly zones. They have reiterated that no weapons inspectors will be allowed to return. That is a pretty bold statement.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I don't have time to go into that in depth, but let me remind my colleagues of a few things. One, the United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 passed in 1991 at the end of the Persian Gulf War requires that international economic sanctions, including an embargo on the sale of oil from Iraq, remain in place until Iraq discloses and destroys its weapons of mass destruction programs and capabilities and undertakes unconditionally never to resume such activities. 
   But the teeth in Resolution 687 have effectively been pulled out one-by-one with the introduction and then continued expansion of the so-called oil-for-food exception to the sanctions: In 1995, UNSCR 986 allowed Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil every 6 months. Iraq produced 1.2 million barrels per day in 1997. In 1997, UNSCR 1153 doubled the offer to $5.2 billion in oil every 6 months. Iraq is now producing 2.5 million barrels of oil. In 1999, United States, France, and Saudi Arabia will offer varying plans on removing the limit on how much oil Iraq can sell and for what purpose. 
   This means that Iraq's oil production of 2.5 million barrels per day equals--their production now equals--the prewar production levels in the year preceding Desert Storm. Iraq's export earnings total $10.4 billion, with 95 percent attributed to oil, which is Iraq's only significant identifiable cash flow. Iraq's imports that same year were only $6.6 billion. 
   The President's National Security Advisor, Sandy Berger, takes issue with my characterization of the U.S. proposal. In a Washington Post editorial, he said that under the Oil-for-Food Program:  
   We prevent Saddam from spending his nation's most valuable treasure on what he cares about most--rebuilding his military arsenal--and force him to spend it on what he cares about least--the people of Iraq. From Saddam's point of view, that makes the program part of the sanctions regime.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. In conclusion, I don't care much about Saddam's point of view, but from the point of view of this Senator from Alaska, what this program does is allow Saddam to use his increased oil capacity to smuggle oil for hard cash and free up resources he can use to finance his weapons of mass destruction. Saddam's cash flow is oil. The smuggling is documented. The displacement issue is harder to track, but Saddam's war machine is still working and his troops are still fit. 
   Let me take issue with the definition of ``humanitarian supplies.'' The most recent U.N.-approved plan would allow Saddam to spend this oil-for-food money, and I think it is interesting to reflect where is he spending his money. Let's look at it, because I think it counters Sandy Berger's remarks that this is going for ``humanitarian'' purposes: $300 million for petroleum equipment; $409 million for electricity networks; $126 million for telecommunication systems; $120 million to buy trucks, repair the railway system, and build food warehouses; $180 million for agriculture equipment, including pesticides. 
   What is the humanitarian goal in guaranteeing an uninterrupted power supply for Saddam's poison gas facilities? What is the humanitarian goal in making sure his elite guards can communicate with each other? 
   And finally, with a new emphasis on building an effective Iraq opposition, I wonder how an opposition can take root when Saddam is able, through the Oil-for-Food Program, to take care of his citizens' basic needs? 
   The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator HELMS, and I will be holding a joint hearing of the Foreign Relations Committee and the Energy Committee next week to ask the administration these questions. I have asked Sandy Berger to come up and defend his arguments, along with Secretary Richardson and Under Secretary Pickering.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will ask the administration to take a different tact to tighten, rather than loosen, the Oil-for-Food Program, to veto U.N. plans that allow Saddam to use this money to finance nonhumanitarian purchases, and to strengthen oil interdiction and inspection operations, including adopting something like the ``no-fly'' zone with a ``no-oil'' vessel zone. Only by taking these measures can the U.N. finally cripple Saddam's regime and increase energy security for all Americas. 
   If we cut off Saddam's oil supply, we will bring him to his knees. That is the only way it will happen. 
   Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to comment on the Department of the Interior s Mineral Management Service proposed oil valuation rule. 
   Earlier this week, speaking with regard to the Administration's FY 2000 budget, Secretary Babbitt said, ``We have met, and talked, and talked, and talked,'' about the proposed rule. But I submit that the only talking done by MMS has been at industry and at Congress, not with them. Mr. President, the proposed rule by MMS was unfair last year and it remains unfair. 
   Babbitt has declared that talks are ``over'' and that MMS is determined to issue its rule in June, when the Congressional moratorium expires. 
   This is simply unconscionable. The domestic oil industry is on its knees right now. But, again, this action by Interior is symptomatic of Administration attacks on the domestic energy industry. 
   The federal government should work to save marginal producers, not put them out of business. Yet that is just what Interior is doing by issuing an unfair royalty rule at a time when producers can least afford it. 
   I would ask Secretary Babbitt the following question: How many royalties can a bankrupt industry pay? I would also ask him if this rule is truly about raising revenue, or is it another Administration scheme to drive petroleum producers out of business. After all, 100 percent of zero is zero. 
   For the record, Mr. President, I will be speaking to MMS and looking into this flawed royalty rule. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the five heros who perished in the Scotch Cap Lighthouse disaster of April 1, 1946--five Coast Guardsmen who gave their lives so that others would survive. The lighthouse keeper was Chief Boatswain's Mate Anthony Lawrence Petit. His crew included Fireman 1st Class Jack Colvin, Seaman 1st Class Dewey Dykstra, Motor Machinist's Mate 2nd Class Leonard Pickering, and Seaman 1st Class Paul James Ness. 
   Lighthouses will always have a place in our history. They have warned mariners of danger, their crews have rescued survivors in the worst conditions imaginable, and their brilliant lamps  have comforted and reassured those who are bound homeward at last. 
   In 1903, Scotch Cap Light Station was the first light put in place on the outside coast of Alaska. Located at the western end of Unimak Island, approximately 425 miles southwest of Anchorage, the light marks the entrance to Unimak Pass. Its only contact with the outside world was--every three months or so--a visit from a buoytender bringing supplies. 
   It was, and is, one of the most isolated places imaginable, especially in the winter, and its hardships were legendary--one lighthouse keeper froze both his hands just trying to go from the lighthouse tower to his quarters during a blizzard. It was so hazardous that no families were allowed, and in the early days, lighthouse keepers were allowed a full year off for every three years they spent on the island. 
   In 1940, the original building was replaced by a brand-new, reinforced-concrete structure built on a bluff near the shore, raising the light to 90 feet over the ocean, and protected by a concrete sea wall. But it wasn't enough. 
   The disaster began early, on April l, 1946. At 1:30 a.m., the crew woke to an earthquake lasting about 30 seconds, strong enough to knock things off shelves. After the quake, the watchstander at a radio-direction-finding (RDF) installation--built a little farther up the hill during World War II--radioed the lighthouse crew and was told there was no major damage. 
   Then, just before two o'clock in the morning, a second quake hit. The second tremor was expected, but not the million-ton wall of water--a tsunami--that quickly followed it. 
   The RDF station logbook reported: Terrific roaring from ocean heard, followed immediately by terrific sea, top of which rose above cliff and struck station, causing considerable damages.'' 
   The watchstander again used his radio to contact the lighthouse. This time, there was no reply. This time, he wrote in the logbook: Light extinguished and horn silent.'' 
   The wave from the second earthquake is now estimated to have been over 100 feet high. It completely erased the concrete lighthouse, killing the five crewmen instantly, and leaving only wreckage. The bodies of Chief Anthony Petit and his crew were gone. They washed ashore again a few days later, identifiable only by their bridgework and jewelry. 
   Chief Anthony Lawrence Petit was just a man--an ordinary man--but his life and death offer a glimpse at the thousands of ordinary men and women who join the Coast Guard and serve their fellow citizens in extraordinary ways. He was born and raised on Michigan's Upper Peninsula, in the town of Hancock, on a ship canal crossing the Keweenaw Peninsula. As a boy, he would have known the ships well, along with the Coast Guard buoy tenders and lighthouses that kept them safe. Petit enlisted in the Coast Guard as a young man in 1926. He never married, and served faithfully in the Coast Guard for the next 20 years. And we know that just before his final transfer to Scotch Cap, he was quoted saying, ``I hope to serve at as many Coast Guard ships and stations as I can before I retire in ten years.'' We know that in the end, he died doing the job he loved; keeping the light burning for those in peril on the sea. And we know his life was not wasted, nor forgotten--and we celebrate the christening of the USCGC Anthony Petit this 30th day of January, in the year of our Lord 1999.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my distinguished colleague from Washington, Senator SLADE GORTON, in introducing legislation that will go far in improving the consistency, predictability and coherency of case law in the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. 
   Our bill, The Federal Ninth Circuit Reorganization Act of 1999, adopts the recommendations of a Congressionally-mandated Commission that studied the alignment of the U.S. Court of Appeals. Retired Supreme Court Justice Byron R. White, chaired the scholarly Commission. 
   The Commission's Report, released last December, calls for a division of the Ninth Circuit into three regionally based adjudicative divisions--the Northern, Middle, and Southern. Each of these regional divisions would maintain a majority of its judges within its region. Each division would have exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from the judicial districts within its region. Further, each division would function as a semi-autonomous decisional unit. To resolve conflicts that may develop between regions, a Circuit Division for Conflict Correction would replace the current limited and ineffective en banc system. Lastly, the Circuit would remain intact as an administrative unit, functioning as it now does. 
   It is important to note that the Commission adopted the arguments that I and several other Senators have put forth to justify a complete division of the Ninth Circuit--Circuit population, record caseloads, and inconsistency in judicial decisions. However, the Commission rejected an administrative division because it believed it would ``deprive the courts now in the Ninth Circuit of the administrative advantages afforded by the present circuit configuration and deprive the West and the Pacific seaboard of a means for maintaining uniform federal law in that area.'' 
   While I don't necessarily reach the same conclusion as the Commission (that an administrative division of the Ninth Circuit is not warranted), I strongly agree with the Committee's conclusion that the restructuring of the Ninth Circuit as proposed in the Commission's Report will ``increase the consistency and coherence of the law, maximize the likelihood of genuine collegiality, establish an effective procedure for maintaining uniform decisional law within the circuit, and relate the appellate forum more closely to the region it serves.'' 
   Mr. President, swift Congressional action is needed. One need only look at the contours of the Ninth Circuit to see the need for this reorganization. Stretching from the Arctic Circle to the Mexican border, past the tropics of Hawaii and across the International Dateline to Guam and the Mariana Islands, by any means of measurement, the Ninth Circuit is the largest of all U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal. 
   The Ninth Circuit serves a population of more than 49 million people, well over a third more than the next largest Circuit. By 2010, the Census Bureau estimates that the Ninth Circuit's population will be more than 63 million--a 40 percent increase in just 13 years, which inevitably will create an even more daunting caseload. 
   Because of its massive size, there often results a decrease in the ability of judges to keep abreast of legal developments within the Ninth Circuit. This  unwieldy caseload creates an inconsistency in Constitutional interpretation. In fact, Ninth Circuit cases have an extraordinarily high reversal rate by the Supreme Court. (During the Supreme Court's 1996-97 session, the Supreme Court overturned 95% of the Ninth Circuit cases heard by the Court.) This lack of Constitutional consistency discourages settlements and leads to unnecessary litigation.

   Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my distinguished colleague from Washington. Senator SLADE GORTON, in introducing legislation that will go far in improving the consistency, predictability and coherency of case law in the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. 
   Our bill, The Federal Ninth Circuit Reorganization Act of 1999, adopts the recommendations of a congressionally-mandated Commission that studied the alignment of the U.S. Court of Appeals. Retired Supreme Court Justice Byron R. White, chaired the scholarly Commission. 
   The Commission's Report, released last December, calls for a division of the Ninth Circuit into three regionally based adjudicative divisions--the Northern, Middle, and Southern. Each of these regional divisions would maintain a majority of its judges within its region. Each division would have exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from the judicial districts within its region. Further, each division would function as a semi-autonomous decisional unit. To resolve conflicts that may develop between regions, a Circuit Division for Conflict Correction would replace the current limited and ineffective en banc system. Lastly, the Circuit would remain intact as an administrative unit, functioning as it now does. 
   It is important to note that the Commission adopted the arguments that I and several other Senators have put forth to justify a complete division of he Ninth Circuit--Circuit population, record caseloads, and inconsistency in judicial decisions. However, the Commission rejected an administrative division because it believed it would ``deprive the courts now in the Ninth Circuit of the administrative advantages afforded by the present circuit configuration and deprive the West and the Pacific seaboard of a means for maintaining uniform federal law in that area.'' 
   While I don't necessarily reach the same conclusion as the Commission (that an administrative division of the Ninth Circuit is not warranted), I strongly agree with the Committee's conclusion that the restructuring of the Ninth Circuit as proposed in the Commission's Report will ``increase the consistency and coherence of the law, maximize the likelihood of genuine collegiality, establish an effective procedure for maintaining uniform decisional law within the circuit, and relate the appellate forum more closely to the region it serves.'' 
   Mr. President, swift congressional action is needed. One need only look at the contours of the Ninth Circuit to see the need for this reorganization. Stretching from the Arctic Circle to the Mexican border, past the tropics of Hawaii and across the International Dateline to Guam and the Mariana Islands, by any means of measurement, the Ninth Circuit is the largest of all U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal. 
   The Ninth Circuit serves a population of more than 49 million people, well over a third more than the next largest circuit. By 2010, the Census Bureau estimates that the Ninth Circuit's population will be more 63 million--a 40-percent increase in just 13 years, which inevitably will create an even more daunting caseload. 
   Because of its massive size, there often results a decrease in the ability of judges to keep abreast of legal developments within the Ninth Circuit. This unwieldy caseload creates an inconsistency in Constitutional interpretation. In fact, Ninth Circuit cases have an extraordinarily high reversal rate by the Supreme Court. (During the Supreme Court's 1996-97 session, the Supreme Court overturned 95 percent of the Ninth Circuit cases heard by the Court.) This lack of Constitutional consistency discourages settlements and leads to unnecessary litigation.
