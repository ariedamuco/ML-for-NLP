   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have long been a supporter of Amtrak. I was chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation before my friend, Mr. LAUTENBERG, swore to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies of the United States, foreign and domestic. I was for it then. I am for it now. We had some problems in connection with putting this measure into this bill. I don't need to go into those problems here. 
   But I want to assure Mr. BIDEN and I want to assure Mr. LAUTENBERG, and assure both leaders, that I will do anything I can next year to support this legislation. I am a cosponsor of the bill, and I will do my best to help enact it at the earliest possible date in the coming Congress. Like the distinguished majority leader, I can't guarantee anything except that I will do  my best to be helpful. Certainly on the Appropriations Committee, if there is an appropriations item, as always, I will support it. Amtrak comes to West Virginia. It comes 3 days a week. I wish it came more often. 
   But I support Amtrak as much as anybody in this Chamber. We don't have large airports in West Virginia; all we have is highways. We certainly are grateful for and certainly very supportive of the limited amount of rail transportation we have. We used to have the Hilltopper; we used to have the Mountaineer in West Virginia. I have been a supporter of the Cardinal longer than I can remember. 
   So Senators may be reassured that I shall do everything I can within my power next year to be helpful. 
   The principal cosponsors, Mr. LAUTENBERG and Mr. BIDEN, made a strong case for the importance of this vital legislation. It will be a central part of our efforts to ensure that our Amtrak system not only is maintained but is also able to make necessary improvements in the future to ensure its continued success. 
   I thank all Senators.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his remarks. I shall miss him. We shall all miss him. He has served on the Appropriations Committee, and served well, served as chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, and served well. 
   He has the highest interests of the Nation always at heart. He has been a very capable Senator. He is never one to forget his obligations, his responsibilities, his duties to the people who have sent him here. I have considered it to be a great honor and high privilege to serve with the Senator. I shall miss him. I am sure he will continue to serve his country in some way. 
   But I do hope the Senator will come back and visit with us from time to time. May the Creator of the universe, Father of all of us, watch over and guide FRANK LAUTENBERG and his family. He is so proud of his family. He often speaks of his children, his grandchildren. I know they love him. He will always be in our recollection. May heavenly angels always attend him in whatever he endeavors. 
   I thank the Senator.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. I will not speak long. 
   Mr. President, the distinguished majority leader has made reference to recess appointments. Let me read what is in the Constitution. I read from section 2 of article II of the Constitution:  
   The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.  
   Having been the majority leader in the Senate earlier in my years here, I have been very careful to caution Presidents not to make recess appointments during the recess of the Senate unless there is indeed an emergency that arises. 
   That is the purpose of this. That provision in the United States Constitution is not put in there to enable any President, Republican or Democrat, to play games with the Senate, or to attempt to do a one-upmanship simply because the Senate is out of session. 
   I hope that Presidents, Democratic and Republican, will be very careful in filling a vacancy that ``may happen'' during a recess. 
   That is the way the Constitution reads. 
   I hope there is no effort to take advantage of those words by appointing someone to fill vacancies that have been in existence for some time. I especially hope that no administration will attempt to fill a Federal judgeship during the recess of the Senate. After all, a Federal judgeship is an appointment for life. That is not an appointment just until the end of the next session. Federal judgeships are, through the Constitution, for life tenure if they conduct themselves appropriately while in office. 
   I want to say this: I am opposed to judgeship appointments during a recess. I hope that any President will proceed very cautiously and not attempt to take advantage of the situation by appointing judgeships during the recess of the Senate. 
   How long will this Senate be in recess?

   Mr. BYRD. I can only see through my own eyes, but I don't consider that to be too long a time to await the appointment of a Federal judgeship or any other office, unless it should be Secretary of Defense or perhaps Secretary of State. But it is certain that there is no need to fill judgeships during this 2 weeks, or whatever it is. We will be back here. I will not support any administration, Democratic or Republican, that attempts to fill Federal judgeships while the Senate is in recess. I think that is playing politics. We all play politics some, but we are fooling around a little too deeply with the fountain of politics. I hope we don't poison that well by attempting to pull a fast one here. Is that what the Senator is talking about?

   Mr. BYRD. I presume to offer the majority leader a suggestion, what I would do if I were in his place. I would write to the President and urge that no such recess appointment be made, and put it in writing, make a record of it. Furthermore, if I were the majority leader, I would talk with the administration.

   Mr. BYRD. I am not trying to tell the Senator what to do, but this is a serious thing with me. As for the politics of it, I am not talking Democratic politics or Republican. But there is such a thing as comity between the executive branch and the legislative branch. There is such a thing as the Constitution, and I happen to hold a copy in my hand right now. There is also such a thing as the prerogatives of the Senate. I try to defend those prerogatives. 
   The Senator made a comment about recess appointments. I hope he will get some assurance. If there is any doubt in his mind--any doubt--that this administration or any other is going to try to make a recess appointment, especially of a Federal judgeship, while the Senate is out for these two or three weeks. I hope the Senator will get a commitment out of the administration, if he can, that that will not happen. 
   That is going pretty far, in my judgment--to appoint a Federal judge for life ``during good behavior.'' I don't know whether there have been judges appointed during a recess of the Senate in the face of this provision which I have just read, to wit:  
   The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during recess of the Senate by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session.  
   That is all I have to say. I have been concerned about that, I say to the distinguished majority leader. I have worked with the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, Mr. THOMPSON, and his committee, and a former Senator, who was the ranking member of that committee, John Glenn. We hammered out some legislation. I was concerned about the fact that the administration was appointing people who stayed in those positions for a year, for 2 years, for longer than 2 years, so we hammered out legislation and passed it in the Senate--the Vacancies Act. 
   About 6 months ago, I asked Senator THOMPSON how the law was working. He indicated he would get back to me in answering my question at some point. 
   I just happened to be here on this floor, during the comments of the majority leader and I can't stress too greatly my concern about recess appointments of Federal judges. 
   I hope the majority leader, if he will pardon my presumptuousness, will try to get some understanding with the administration about that. That is the way I always did when I was majority leader: I got some understanding.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as has been the case on far too many occasions in the past number of years, the Senate finds itself today in the position of having to deal with a massive omnibus appropriations bill. We have had to pass a record number--21--of Continuing Resolutions in order to keep the Federal Government operating since the fiscal year began on October 1st. These Continuing Resolutions were necessary because we in the Congress and the Administration could not resolve our differences on a myriad of issues, most of which have not involved funding levels at all. Rather, the haggling for the past many weeks has been over issues such as ergonomics regulations, immigration, and certain regulatory matters; all of which would be more appropriately handled by the authorizing committees with jurisdiction over them. Instead of following the established practices and the regular–

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in these waning days and hours of the 106th Congress, the focus in Washington is naturally on what action is taking place to resolve the remaining fiscal year 2001 appropriations bills and concluding the business of this Congress. However, all around us, life goes on. Our constituents in the steel industry must be among the few in America who will not be happy to see the 106th Congress adjourn sine die. Our constituents in the steel industry will see Congress's adjournment as a thinning of the bucket brigade that has spent the last two years trying to bail out an  industry being flooded by cheap, illegally dumped steel. These people, our constituents from Weirton and Wheeling, West Virginia, from Pennsylvania, Illinois, Alabama, Maryland, Utah--their arms are tired, their voices hoarse from the effort of keeping their heads above water and shouting for help. As we look forward to adjournment, they are continuing to face a flood whose undertow threatens to pull them under. Today, as a result of this continuing crisis in steel, imports make up almost 40 percent of the U.S. market, compared to a historical rate of approximately 18 percent. 
   Congress has tried to respond. Members have supported individual companies and groups in filing trade cases with the Administration, attempting to use our anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws as they were intended, to thwart illegal actions by foreign competitors. Members of Congress, myself included, have introduced, supported, and fought for passage of legislation to help this core American industry. But the flood of illegally dumped steel continues, fed by the Asian economic crisis, the failure of the Russian economy, and foreign competitors seeking to gain a competitive edge with the help of illegal government subsidies. When one trade case is filed with regard to one type of steel, these competitors switch to another type of steel, forcing affected U.S. companies to bear the cost of their sales losses combined with the cost and time of collecting data and building their legal cases. The overall effect is to grind small companies down to the verge of collapse. 
   In 1977, there were 16,961 steelworkers on the payroll in West Virginia. In March 2000, there were just 6,857, a loss of 10,104 good-paying jobs. That's a 60 percent loss. So you understand why I am concerned. The national picture is no brighter. In 1980, there were 1,142,000 workers nationwide in the primary metals industry, which includes steel. As of September 2000, that total employment number had dropped to just 692,000, a drop of approximately 39 percent. 
   In the last two years, thousands of steelworkers have been laid off, some for considerable periods. Six steel companies have declared bankruptcy since 1998. But total steel imports in 2000 will be over 2 1/2 times higher than in 1991. Total steel imports through August 2000 are 17 percent higher than over the same period in 1999 and are greater even than imports over the same period in 1998, a record year. At the same time, steel prices continue to be depressed, with hot-rolled steel prices 12 percent lower in August 2000 than in the first quarter of 1998, and average import customs values for all steel products more than 15 percent lower over the same period. 
   Is this how we want to end an era of American history? Do we want to watch the linchpin of the 
   American industrial revolution--our steel industry--be felled by government subsidized foreign competition, aided and abetted by indifferent application of the very trade laws implemented to protect American companies and American workers from illegal competition? I certainly hope not. When our crippled Aegis destroyer, the ill-fated U.S.S. Cole, is brought home for repairs, I would like American steel to bind up those wounds. I don't want to be dependent on foreign sources of steel for critical national defense needs. During World War II, I was a welder, helping to build the ships that supported our forces in that war. Today, I am a legislator, and I want to help the industry that supports our forces in war and in other critical missions. 
   I had prepared a resolution, cosponsored by Senators SPECTER, ROCKEFELLER, ABRAHAM, BAUCUS, BAYH, DEWINE, DURBIN, HOLLINGS, KOHL, LEVIN, LINCOLN, LUGAR, MIKULSKI, SANTORUM, SARBANES, SCHUMER, SESSIONS, SHELBY, THURMOND, VOINOVICH, and WELLSTONE, that would be a Senate companion to H. Res. 635. H. Res. 635 was introduced on October 18, and currently has 237 cosponsors. This resolution would call upon the President to take all appropriate action within his power to provide relief to the steel industry injured by these unfair actions of our trading partners. It would request an immediate and expedited U.S. International Trade Commission investigation for positive adjustment under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974. I am pleased that my resolution was, instead, accepted and included in the conference report to accompany the Labor/HHS appropriations bill. 
   This action by the Administration is necessary. We need a broad-based, comprehensive approach to dealing with this crisis in the domestic steel industry. Fighting this war one skirmish at a time, on one product type at a time by one company at a time, is simply and slowly bleeding our steel companies dry. We cannot let them continue to pick our steel companies off one at a time. We need to put the full weight of our attention and our resources on dealing comprehensively with this matter. We need to be vigilant across all fronts, and we need to develop longer strategic vision if we are to preserve this vital domestic industry. 
   We need a level playing field. I have no doubt that American steel companies can compete on a level playing field. But they cannot compete against steel that is priced at or below the cost of production by foreign companies subsidized by governments who seek not only to preserve their own steel production capacity, but to profit by gaining U.S. market share and putting our companies into bankruptcy. I am, unfortunately, confident that the International Trade Commission's investigation will find that the steel crisis of 1998 is far from over. In fact, steel imports are on track to match or possibly exceed the record figures of 1998. So, sadly, our domestic steel producers should have no problem meeting the stringent standards of proof required under section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 to prove that an injury has or can be expected to occur. 
   I commend the many Members of the Senate who join me in calling for this action to be taken, for standing up for steel and the men and women and families who depend on steel jobs. I also commend the Senate for including this provision in this bill. I urge the Administration to proceed immediately to initiate a Section 201 investigation of steel dumping. It is urgently needed.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, conference report language has been added to H.R. 4577, the fiscal year 2001 Labor/HHS Appropriations bill to address concerns about the safety of coal waste impoundments. A study, which is to be completed by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) in nine months, will be funded by monies included in the Mine Safety and Health Administration's (MSHA) Fiscal Year 2001 appropriations. Because MSHA has regulatory authority for coal waste impoundment oversight, I hope that MSHA officials will play an active role throughout the course of the study. The NAS study is intended to review the coal waste impoundments and report on viable methods and alternatives to prevent another dam failure like the one that occurred in Martin County, Kentucky, in October of this year. 
   I would like to clarify the understanding of the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Labor/HHS Appropriations subcommittee regarding this conference report language. Is it their understanding that the NAS study should involve the participation of experts to include, but not be limited to, members of relevant state and federal agencies, such as the Mine Safety and Health Administration, the Office of Surface Mining and Enforcement, the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as industry, labor, citizen, and environmental groups, which have either been, or may be, impacted by impoundments in their areas? Further, in addition to addressing how best to assure the stability of existing impoundments, is it the understanding of my distinguished colleagues that this NAS study should also address alternative methods of coal mine waste disposal and placement in the future?

I want to compliment, also, the Parliamentarian. It was a joy to hear the Chair intervene at the right place and to say the right things for the RECORD. I saw that he was being guided by the Parliamentarian. So much of the time, I think we do our work in a rather shoddy fashion here. I am glad  to see the Parliamentarian very alert, watching, listening, and prompting the Chair. That is the way it should be so the RECORD will read today in such a manner as will make us proud. Sometimes, I guess, we forget that future generations will be reading the RECORD. Not only that, but we Senators should learn as well how to handle these matters. It does me good to see a Chair who is alert and a Parliamentarian who is alert.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, once in a while an individual comes along who shines with such a special light that it illuminates the darkness for others. I have been fortunate to employ one such individual on my staff for the last 8 years: Lisa Tuite, Lisa achieved her master of arts degree in national security studies from Georgetown University in 1990 and her bachelor of arts degree in foreign affairs from the University of Virginia. She came to my office as a legislative fellow from the National Photographic Interpretation Center. I soon recognized her talent. Lisa was employed in my office to serve as a legislative assistant for defense and foreign affairs and to assist me on the Armed Services Committee. She has done all of these things and done them well. Eventually she rose through the ranks to become my administrative assistant. 
   Multitalented, thoughtful, with an encyclopedic grasp of detail, Lisa Tuite has been an inspiration to my staff and she has been an inspiration to me. 
   I have been here on Jenkins Hill for 48 years, longer than anybody else who is in the Congress today in either body. JOHN DINGELL is the dean of the House of Representatives. I served with JOHN DINGELL's father in the House. I speak of JOHN DINGELL in a very admiring fashion. He is a man of tremendous talent, a fine, fine Member of the House. But I have been around quite a while, and I have seen a lot of people come and go in the Chamber here, as well in my employment, as one can imagine--48 years, starting out in the House of Representatives with five persons on my staff a long time ago. 
   I have seen Senators come and go. I have seen our staffs at the front desk come and go. But this particular individual, of whom I speak today, merits my highest compliments. I have rarely employed anyone with her patience, her writing ability, her organizational instincts or her boundless energy. She is that rare breed of Senate staffer, seemingly born for the job and eager to do it. Moreover, as anyone who knows Lisa can attest, she is resolute, unflappable, and unfailingly cheerful. I have seldom seen her discouraged, and there is literally no task that she will not assume with relish, and always unfailing in her courtesy. I shall miss her. 
   She has the soul of a gardener. It is a hobby at which she excels. She is a cultivator of beauty and a nurturer of growth. I am speaking not only with respect to plants and flowers and, yes, crops; but I am speaking also with reference to other individuals. For my other employees, she has been an inspiration as well. The young staffers whom she has so carefully tended and so artfully encouraged have blossomed, blossomed like the daffodils, blossomed under Lisa's tutelage. She has graciously focused her sunshine upon them all, upon all who work with her. 
   Alas, as all good things come to an end, at least all things that are mortal, Lisa will be leaving my staff to spend more time with her husband Jim, her mother and father, and her adorable daughter Rachel. And I am the loser. I am saddened to lose her, but I know that she will grace whatever she puts her heart and hand to in the future years as she has done in my office for the too brief time that she worked among us and with us and lent us her gracious smile and her scintillating personality, her wit, her good sense, her good 
   judgment, her dedication, her loyalty. 
   So to Lisa, my staff and I say:  
   The hours are like a string of pearls, 
   The days like diamonds rare, 
   The moments are the threads of gold, 
   That bind them for our wear, 
   So may the years that come to you, 
   Such health and good contain, 
   That every moment, hour, and day, 
   Be like a golden chain.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, soon, the 106th Congress will draw to a close, and with that final bell, the Senate careers of a number of very fine Members will also, suddenly, draw to a close. Such are the wages of service in this Republic. Senator ROBB, Senator GORTON, Senator GRAMS, Senator ASHCROFT, Senator ABRAHAM will have answered their final rollcall. They will have waited through their final quorum calls and they will have left the Senate floor, as a Member of this body, for a final time. Oh, they may be back to visit, and I hope they will come back to visit. They will always be welcome here. But I am sure that the Senate floor is not quite the same when one is not allowed to vote or to make a statement. 
   However, these distinguished Members will always be a unique part of the Senate family and of the Senate's history. In the history of this great Republic--I do not speak of it as a democracy, I speak of it as a Republic; as a representative democracy, yes--in the history of this great Republic, there have only been 1,853 men and women who have served here 
   since April 6 of 1789. In January 2001, that number will rise to 1,864. These names can be found listed in rank order, a list that is immutable and irreplaceable. 
   More than that, each Senator becomes a part of the institution of the Senate. Each Member's actions help to shape the precedents and the practices of the Senate, just as a Member's amendments, bills, and votes shape the legislative history of the land. The singular honor of serving in the United States Senate leaves its mark on each Member. I am tempted to say that each Member leaves his or her mark on the Senate, but that would not be accurate. Few Senators perhaps leave their mark on the Senate, but the Senate leaves its mark, unblemished, unstained, on the life of every Member. 
   I wish today to speak of two of these departing Senators with whom I have worked closely over the years: Senator CHARLES ``CHUCK'' ROBB and Senator SLADE GORTON. Senator GORTON's number among the roll of Senators is 1,752. Senator ROBB's number is 1,788. They are listed on the roll of Members of the United States Senate. Senator ROBB, Senator GORTON, and the other departing Members, will carry the badge of Senate service with them. It is a badge of honor that they will carry with them. 
   These men are much more than a name or a number, of course. Senator ROBB has been a dedicated public servant. He has served his country in many ways. I have served with him on the Senate Committee on Armed Services where he was most recently the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support. He was also a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and he was for many years a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. 
   As a former marine, as well as a representative of a Commonwealth with a very large military presence, Senator ROBB was a tireless advocate for the men and the women who labor in uniform and in other intelligence and supporting roles to protect our great Nation. Senator ROBB has also sought to protect and further the economic health of the Nation. 
   He has served this Nation in many ways, from active duty as a United States Marine to Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia to United States Senator. To his service here, he has brought a conscience. He charted his own course, made his own votes and his decisions using his moral compass rather than polls or media campaigns. 
   I will always remember Senator ROBB for his gentle courtesy, his calm and even manner, his soft-spoken ways. Though passionate in his beliefs, he worked quietly and steadily in a bipartisan spirit to achieve his goals. The State of Virginia is better off today for his efforts in the Senate, and the Senate has been the better for his presence. Now, to Senator GORTON. 
   Senator SLADE GORTON knows something about leaving the Senate, having left once before in 1987, only to return 2 years later to serve from 1989 through the end of the 106th Congress. I have been his ranking member on the Senate Committee on Appropriations. I am here to say that I could not have had a better partner than the distinguished  Senator from Washington. Of course, I have said that many times before. In these past years, he has been the wheel horse of our team, putting his shoulder to the wheel and pulling the heavy load of putting 
   together the complex Interior appropriations bill. He has shown himself to be a master of the appropriations process, and no one, I venture to say, knows the Interior appropriations bill and the programs it funds better than SLADE GORTON does. Senator GORTON has a truly impressive grasp of detail, and yet he never lets minutiae cloud his vision of the overall picture. I could not have asked for a more congenial, collegial, commonsense colleague, and I will truly miss my friend, SLADE GORTON, on the committee. 
   I know that the rest of the Senate will miss our colleague from Washington as well. He is well liked on both sides of the aisle as gracious, polite, soft spoken. He never rebukes a colleague. Rather, he will look up, blink in polite astonishment, and with a gentle question point out the error of one's ways. 
   Senator GORTON is another example of a Member who makes the Senate work by focusing on the needs of his constituents. Besides his work on the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee and throughout the entire appropriations process, Senator GORTON looked after the interests of Washington State from his seat on the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation where he chaired the Subcommittee on Aviation and also served on the Subcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries, both important to a coastal State that is home to Boeing Aviation. 
   He also served as the vice chair, the vice chairman--Mr. President, I break my sentence. I do not believe in this nonsense. I do not believe in this nonsense called political correctness. I have no use for it whatsoever. There is a chair right there across the aisle; here is a chair beside me. There is a difference between a chairman and a chair. I do not subscribe to the word ``chair'' except where it is appropriate to use it, and I never refer to a human being as a ``chair.'' I do not want anyone referring to me as a ``chair.'' 
   Senator GORTON also served as the vice chairman of the Subcommittee on Water and Power on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee--again topics of interest to his State with significant hydropower concerns. And if these duties did not keep him busy enough, Senator GORTON also served on the Senate Budget Committee. 
   Senator GORTON's focus serves the Senate well. In defending the different perspectives of States large and small, populous or not, rural or urban, individual Senators act as the kind of internal checks and balances that the framers envisioned, keeping the tyranny of a majority from putting other groups and interests at a disadvantage. 
   The Senate is designed to give States an equal voice and equal standing, despite differences among the States with respect to population. 
   I shall especially miss Senator GORTON because we worked very closely together on the Appropriations Committee. It was a very busy subcommittee. It is a westerner's subcommittee, in fact. That is the way I have always looked upon it, although I have found it to be very important, as well, to States of the East and South and North. 
   I wish him well. I will miss him. As an able and talented man, he will soon find new venues in which to continue serving the public interest. 
   He traveled all across this country, he and his family, on bicycles upon one occasion some years ago, from the west coast to the east coast, the whole family, on bicycles. So one might easily imagine what kind of adventurer SLADE GORTON is. That takes a lot of courage, a lot of determination. But wherever he goes, and wherever Senator ROBB goes, wherever these other Senators whose names I have mentioned go, they will always be called ``Senator.'' Majorian, in 457 A.D., when he was made emperor of the West, referred to himself as ``a prince who still glories in the name of Senator.'' 
   Mr. President, I close with a few lines from a poem by Ralph Waldo Emerson. It is a fitting tribute to the fine, lasting work performed in this mighty Senate by these departing Members: Senator ROBB, Senator GORTON, Senator GRAMS, Senator ASHCROFT, and Senator ABRAHAM. I am speaking of these Senators. There are other Senators who are departing and about whom I have spoken previously. Senators whose names I have mentioned today are Senators who were in the most recent election, who fought nobly and well, and who lost.  
   What makes a nation's pillars high 
   And its foundations strong? 
   What makes it mighty to defy 
   The foes that round it throng?  
   It is not gold. Its kingdoms grand 
   Go down in battle shock; 
   Its shafts are laid on sinking sand, 
   Not on abiding rock.  
   Is it the sword? Ask the red dust 
   Of empires passed away; 
   The blood has turned their stones to rust, 
   Their glory to decay.  
   And is it pride? Ah, that bright crown 
   Has seemed to nations sweet; 
   But God has struck its luster down 
   In ashes at His feet.  
   Not gold but only men can make 
   A people great and strong; 
   Men who for truth and honor's sake 
   Stand fast and suffer long.  
   Brave men who work while others sleep, 
   Who dare while others fly-- 
   They build a nation's pillars deep 
   And lift them to the sky.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as we prepare, in these last days, to go home for the Christmas holidays--and I suppose we include New Year's as well, at which time we will go into a new century. To all those who have been a part of perpetrating this colossal hoax on the American people, trying to make the American people believe that the new century began in January of 2000, let me say, come January 1 of 2001, all mankind will then, indeed, move into the 21st century. It will begin, and so will the third millennium. Anyone who can count from 1 to 100 knows that that is the case, whether they use the old math or the new. We will begin the 21st century on January 1 next.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, each day the Senate is in session the Chaplain leads us in prayer. From time to time, we have a guest Chaplain, a guest Chaplain perhaps coming from one or the other of the States. I am always awed to stand in this Chamber and hear the Chaplain deliver the prayer. As long as this Republic stands, I am confident that the Senate and the House will be opened with prayer. 
   In West Virginia, anytime there is a public ceremony of any kind, there is sure to be a prayer, just as surely as we have the Pledge of Allegiance. 
   The Chaplain is always here. He ministers to us, not just by way of a daily prayer here, but if we are ill, in the hospital, or if a family member is in the hospital, if we lose a loved one, the Chaplain is there. He is there to console and to comfort us and to pray with us. 
   I feel that we should take note of this as we prepare to close out our session. ``More things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of.......'' Tennyson said that. I just remembered it. 
   So I thank our Chaplain on behalf of all of us--on behalf of the Members, on behalf of the officers of the Senate, on behalf of the employees of the Senate. We do appreciate the pastorship that he performs. He shepherds the flock. We are part of his flock. 
   I want to pay my respects to him, and let him know that his efforts, his work, his prayers, even when we do not hear them, do not go unnoticed. 
   Often he sees me and says: I prayed for you yesterday. I was praying for you this morning. We certainly need it. I cherish those prayers. 
   ``Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord.'' 
   I thank him.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, that completes my remarks for today. I thank the Chair for his patience. In this instance, I refer to ``the Chair.'' I thank the Chair for his patience. The present occupant is a fine Senator. He pays attention. He does not sit up at the desk and read newspapers or sign his mail.  
   There used to be a phone at that desk. And Senators who presided would use that telephone. When I became majority leader, I had the telephone removed because I thought that a Presiding Officer should pay attention to what was going on on the floor. 
   I always say to new Senators: Pay attention while presiding. Don't sign your mail while presiding. If you feel you have to sign mail in the chair, tell the leadership that you have business to take care of in your office. Let someone else preside. 
   There are a few Senators who have listened to me and who carry that admonition with them. PAT ROBERTS is one such Senator. He sits up there and is very alert. He never signs his mail while presiding. He never reads a magazine or a newspaper. He is alert, and he watches the Senate proceedings. Why shouldn't he? This is the premier upper house in the world today, and it should set the example for members of the state legislatures. I was once a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates. I was once a member of the West Virginia Senate. 
   I like to believe that when legislators throughout the 50 States of this country look at the Presiding Officer of the U.S. Senate on television, they see someone who is alert, someone who is paying attention, someone who is ready to make the ruling, someone who is ready to answer the parliamentary inquiry, someone who is alert to the need for order in the Senate Chamber and for order in the Galleries. They shouldn't see someone presiding who is signing mail and paying no attention to what is transpiring in the Chamber. That is not a very good example for other legislators in the country to see. 
   This young Senator, Senator FITZGERALD from Illinois, who is now presiding, pays close attention to the floor debate. 
   In some ways, it is kind of a thankless task. I have taken my share. Usually it is the new Members who take their turn at presiding. Somebody has to preside. I sat in that chair in one sitting for 22 hours. I have had my share. For 22 hours I sat during a civil rights filibuster--almost all of one day and one night. Vice President Nixon came the next morning to preside. But I know what it is to sit in the chair for hours at a time. 
   I compliment all those who take their turn at presiding. They can learn a good many things about the Senate when they preside and preside well. 
   Presiding Officers should maintain order in the Senate. That gavel is not easy to break. In my time here and in all of the history of this institution, which goes back 212 years now, I believe, there has been only one gavel broken. That gavel was replaced by the country of India and is in use now. If I am not mistaken and if my memory serves me well, it is the gavel that was presented to the Senate when Richard Nixon was Vice President. It will not crack easily. 
   I urge, for the record, the Presiding Officers to use it. Don't hesitate to hit the desk hard. It won't crack. 
   As we come into the Chamber during rollcall votes, we see other Senators with whom we would like to talk a few minutes. In doing so, we make a lot of noise. I know the Chair is hesitant sometimes to call senior Members of this body to order. But the Chair should have no hesitation. Every Senator, no matter how senior he is, should respect that Chair. As a matter of fact, the more senior the Senator is, the more he should respect the Chair because he has been here longer. 
   I say to this Chair and, through him, to all the other Senators who preside, stay alert, keep your eye on the Senate, and maintain order. And when you ask for order, get it. Don't stop until you do get it. We all owe that respect to the Chair. 
   I thank all employees for their patience.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to add a few accolades to those that have already been expressed on the 98th birthday of our very distinguished and able colleague, Senator THURMOND. 
   Senator THURMOND and I have worked together in this Chamber for 42 years. I say this with a considerable amount of pleasure. I have always found Senator THURMOND to be straightforward, courageous--he is absolutely fearless--and always considerate of the viewpoints of others. We were here during the great civil rights debates of the 1960s. We have seen colleagues come and go. We have shared viewpoints on many of the great issues that have been debated upon this stage in the years that have gone by: The Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Panama Canal Treaties in the late 1970s--the many issues that have deeply affected our country and the people of our country. 
   While Senator THURMOND and I belong to different political parties, I think we have attempted to see through the fog of political debate, and we have attempted to speak and act in the best interests of the country as a whole. We have often risen above the political fray. 
   Senator THURMOND has always been very courteous to me. I can remember those years, now long ago, when Senator THURMOND lost his wife. He was a Democrat in those years, and I remember coming into the Senate Chamber on that morning after. Senator THURMOND sat there in the back row behind me that morning. I walked up to him, shook his hand, and told him of my sorrow at his loss. 
   I can remember when Senator THURMOND lost his daughter. I went to South Carolina to be with him in that time of trial and tribulation and sorrow. I saw the great outpouring of affection and love by his constituents in South Carolina. 
   I remember, too, the day in which there was a memorial service conducted for my grandson, Michael, who was tragically killed at the age of 17. I recall that at that memorial service there were two other Senators present--Senator Randolph, my colleague at that time in the Senate, and Senator THURMOND. My colleague today, Senator ROCKEFELLER, was there, but he was at that time the Governor of the State of West Virginia. 
   I shall never forget when STROM THURMOND came to my side at that moment of great sorrow when I gave up my grandson. Senator THURMOND has always been a Senator who sympathizes with the sorrows, the sadness, and the joys of his colleagues. 
   I went out here some distance from the Capitol a few years ago to attend the funeral service of a relative of one of my staff members. This relative was a black man. Who came to that funeral service? Me. I was there because it was a relative of one of my staff members. Senator THURMOND was there. He came there to show his sympathy and his concern to those bereaved people. 
   I marveled at his presence on that occasion. It made me wonder, how many funerals of persons of other races, of other parties, and of other creeds does this man attend around this city? 
   Let me just say today that it has also been not just a pleasure to serve with Senator THURMOND but it has been an honor. I salute him on this his 98th birthday. 
   Abraham lived to be 175. Isaac lived to be 180. Jacob lived to be 147. Joshua lived to be 110. Joseph lived to be 110. Moses lived to be 120. STROM THURMOND is only 98. I thank the good Lord that I can be here today to share with him this birthday of his. 
   Let me close by remembering a few lines, if I might, that were written by a poet.  
   Count your garden by the flowers, 
   Never by the leaves that fall. 
   Count your days by the sunny hours, 
   Not remembering clouds at all. 
   Count your nights by stars, not shadows. 
   Count your life by smiles, not tears.  
   On this beautiful December afternoon, Senator THURMOND:  
   Count your age by friends, not years.  
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, the Senate has now before it the latest in a series of continuing resolutions in order to keep the operations of the Federal Government going for another 48 hours. This will be the 17th continuing resolution for the fiscal year which began on October 1 of this year--the 17th continuing resolution for the fiscal year. This is the largest number of continuing resolutions that has ever been required in order to enable Congress to complete its work on the 13 annual appropriations bills. 
   As Senators are aware, we have yet to complete action on 4 of the 13 fiscal year 2001 appropriations bills; namely, the Commerce-Justice-State-Judiciary, Labor-HHS, legislative branch, and Treasury-General Government appropriations bills. We are now into the third month of fiscal year 2001, and we have yet to get our work done on these very critical appropriations bills. 
   It seems to me that the best way to set the tone for the 107th Congress, which will begin on January 3, 2001, would be to finish the work of the 106th Congress immediately. The time has long since passed for us to end partisan bickering over issues in these various appropriations bills. Why should it take so long to reach a compromise on the remaining issues? What in the world is keeping us from completing action on these appropriations bills 2 months after the new fiscal year has begun? 
   We have been aware of those issues for months. Most of these issues do not involve appropriations at all. Rather, they involve legislative riders which have nothing to do with the operation of the Federal Government as far as funding levels are concerned. Of course, legislative riders are not new. The Wilmot Proviso was such a rider back in the days when slavery was being discussed. 
   These issues involve ergonomics, immigration, tobacco lawsuits, et cetera, matters that properly belong in the jurisdiction of other committees. We should not continue to tie up appropriations bills for a fiscal year that began more than 2 months ago--haggling over issues such as these. 
   The partisanship should end right now, right here this week, on these remaining appropriations bills. We should not permit ourselves to delay action on these matters until the next Congress or the next administration. The time has come for this 106th Congress to complete its work now; clean the slate so that the 107th Congress and the new administration can begin with a fresh start. 
   We have a tremendous opportunity here. We can demonstrate to the American people and to the world that even though the Presidential election is still in the courts, the people's branch--the people's branch--is here, the people's branch is functioning, and the people's branch intends to get our work done. We can demonstrate to the Nation and we can demonstrate to the world that there is stability in this Government even though the next President's name and the next President's party are yet not known. 
   The way we wind up this year's business can be a 
   constructive harbinger for the way we approach next year's business with a new President and a closely divided Senate and House. We can start now to reassure the American people that we can stop the bickering, stop the wrangling, and begin to behave as adults instead of as 4-year-olds. 
   We can show the new Senators of both parties how to reach across the aisle for the good of the Nation. Comity and compromise will have to be the watchwords in the new year, and we can begin practicing that new tone right now. 
   I hope we can pass these four remaining appropriations bills over which the distinguished chairman, over which the staffs, over which the Members of both parties, both sides of the aisle, have spent hours and hours and days in efforts to complete the work, and I hope we can go home to ponder our new responsibilities. Repeatedly passing 48-hour continuing resolutions, or 24-hour continuing resolutions, and continuing to try to play for some partisan advantage sets exactly the wrong tone for next year's changed circumstances. 
   Senators, let us employ our intellects and our considerable talents for the good of the Nation. Let us do our duty and fund the Government, as we were expected to be doing. There is no advantage to putting off this work, no advantage whatsoever to putting it off any longer. There is only the very possible danger of poisoning the well from which we all must drink in a new and very different reality setting next year. 
   So I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work together with Chairman STEVENS and myself and with the leadership in seeing to it that we work together in a spirit of honest compromise to wrap up the remaining matters on the last four appropriations bills and get them to the President's desk for his signature this week. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

This year is the closing year of the 20th century. That is according to the old math as well as the new math.

Let's be about our work.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the great success and continuing strength of the United States as a republic is due in no small part to the willingness of our citizens to be soldiers and, no less important, of our soldiers to be citizens. 
   One such soldier-citizen is General Richard L. Lawson, late of the Air Force of the United States, now on the verge of a second retirement, this time from a productive career in public life. 
   On active duty as General Lawson, he held positions of trust at the highest levels of responsibility in planning and executing the military elements of U.S. foreign policy during times of great tension. 
   As Dick Lawson, the envoy plenipotentiary from the most basic of America's basic industries to the councils of government that include this Senate, he has made useful and durable contributions to policies that make the Nation more secure and energy independent. 
   Richard Lawson is, in fundamental ways, exceptional, if not unique. 
   He is one of few individuals to hold every enlisted and commissioned rank in the military structure from enlistee of bottom rank to the four-star grade that signifies overall command. He may well be the only one to have done this between two services--to rise step-by-step from buck private to regimental sergeant major in the Army National Guard of Iowa; and then, when commissioned into the Air Force, from second lieutenant to general. 
   Highlights of General Lawson's Air Force career include the following: military assistant at the White House under two Presidents; Commander, Eighth Air Force; Director of Plans and Policy for the Joint Chiefs of Staff; U.S. representative to the military committee of the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance; Chief of staff at Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Powers in Europe; and, finally, command of the day-to-day activities and deployments of all services in the U.S. European Command, the deputy commander-in-chief. 
   During his span of service, some important national and international developments included the following: the making of plans and the acquisition of means to re-establish U.S. strength and flexibility and deterrence; the restoration of cordiality among the NATO allies. 
   General Lawson left active service in 1986. Early the next year, while figuratively behind the plow, like Cincinnatus, he was approached by a delegation of coal industry leaders. They found him, in fact, clearing undergrowth on his acreage in the Virginia countryside. They called him again into service, and he again responded. 
   In the 14 years since then, Dick Lawson has presided over the unification of what once was both a profusion and a confusion of voices that sought to speak for mining. He first blended together within the National Coal Association all elements of the coal industry. More recently, he joined the many elements of mining represented by coal, metals and minerals producers. With the union of the coal association and the American Mining Congress to form the National Mining Association, two voices became one.  
   It has been America's good fortune to have leaders which exhibit true faith and allegiance to the general welfare and the blessings of liberty. 
   One such leader is Richard L. Lawson. I personally thank him for his efforts, for his patriotism, and for his vision. 
   His 40 years of combined military duty is rich with decorations and honors. It includes the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal with oak leaf cluster, and the Legion of Merit. On the level of personal service, it includes the Soldier's Medal that recognizes an act of courage not involving an armed enemy; and the Air Medal and the Bronze Star that reflect combat duty in the Vietnam War. 
   We owe a debt of gratitude to men like General Lawson, who give so freely and so much to this great nation. May this nation always be blessed with such citizens. 
 God give us men! A time like this demands strong minds, great hearts, true faith, and ready hands. Men whom the lust of office does not kill; Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy; Men who possess opinions and a will; Men who have honor; men who will not lie. 
 Men who can stand before a demagogue And brave his treacherous flatteries without winking. 
 Tall men, sun--crowned; Who live above the fog, In public duty and in private thinking. For while the rabble with its thumbworn creeds, It's large professions and its little deeds, mingles in selfish strife, Lo! Freedom weeps! Wrong rules the land and waiting justice sleeps. God give us men! 
 Men who serve not for selfish booty; But real men, courageous, who flinch not at duty. Men of dependable character; Men of sterling worth; Then wrongs will be redressed, and right will rule the earth. God Give us Men!

   Mr. BYRD. I also agree with these comments. The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources has jurisdiction over ``Extraction of minerals from oceans and Outer Continental Shelf lands'' under Rule XXV(g)(1)6. of the Standing Rules of the Senate. Pursuant to that authority, it has jurisdiction over the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation continues to have jurisdiction under Rule XXV(f)(1) over ``Transportation and commerce aspects of Outer Continental Shelf lands''. The Coastal Impact Assistance program, which will now be section 31 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, is an important and necessary component of our leasing program on the Outer Continental Shelf and is certainly within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. How we choose to route the funding for this program is incidental and has nothing to do with the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. As the minority leader noted, it is immaterial whether the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Commerce or some other officer is responsible, the program remains exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, earlier today I voted for the conference report  on the Commerce-Justice-State bill, which was included with the D.C. appropriations bill. Both those bills were in the same conference report. I voted in favor of those measures. But the CJS measure was, in actuality, a seriously flawed piece of legislation with a number of problems attendant to it. 
   The first problem that I had with it was that it was a conference report, and thus it was not subject to amendment. The underlying appropriations bills went straight from the Senate Appropriations Committee to the conference committee, totally bypassing the Senate floor. The full Senate was afforded no opportunity to debate or amend these two appropriations bills. These are not the first appropriations bills to be herded through Congress in this fashion this year, but that fact does not make the practice any less objectionable. It is a simple case of cutting corners in the name of political expediency, a practice 
   in which the United States Senate should not engage. 
   Second, the Commerce, Justice, State bill includes a controversial immigration rider, the Legal Immigration Family Equity Act, a scaled down spinoff of the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. The Senate dealt with this issue last month during consideration of the H-1B visa bill, when it refused to consider the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. I opposed suspending the rules to allow that measure to be offered as an amendment to the H-1B visa bill because I believe that such legislation sends the wrong message to those who might consider entering this country illegally. I believed then, as I believe today, that granting amnesty to aliens who are in this country illegally simply encourages others to enter the country illegally. 
   Although the Legal Immigration Family Equity Act would grant amnesty to a smaller group of illegal aliens, it creates the same problems as the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act by rewarding illegal aliens for breaking U.S. law. It should make no difference whether we grant amnesty to one million illegal aliens or only a handful of that number. The principle is the same. Amnesty for illegal immigration sends the wrong message, period. Worse, these bills are an affront to those immigrants who have played by the rules, often waiting many years before being allowed to settle here legally. 
   I am opposed to the sending of these mixed signals by Congress. It is counterproductive for the United States to vigorously protect its long and porous borders from illegal aliens--at great expense to the taxpayers, I might add--while at the same time granting amnesty to selected groups of those aliens who manage to cross the border undetected or otherwise enter the country under false pretenses. The Senate should not endorse an immigration policy that rewards aliens who violate the law. 
   I realize that my views are at odds with a number of my colleagues, and I respect their position. I respect their viewpoints, and I would be very happy to debate the merits of new immigration legislation with them at the proper time and on the proper vehicle. This was not the proper time, and this conference report was not the proper vehicle. Neither the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act nor the Legal Immigration Family Equity Act has been considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over immigration issues. No hearings have been held. No report has been issued by the Committee so that other senators can better understand the implication of these bills. No full scale debate has been aired. 
   The Commerce-Justice-State conference report could not be amended. It was a take-it-or-leave-it-package. Controversial immigration legislation that the Senate refused to consider once this year as an amendment to an immigration bill should not be resurrected under any guise as a legislative rider on an unamendable appropriations conference report. 
   Finally, I am concerned with executive branch meddling on this conference report. The President has said he will veto the conference report because the immigration rider does not go far enough. He wants the broader Latino and Immigrant Fairness legislation on this appropriations bill. This is the same President who has been complaining bitterly about legislative riders on other appropriations bills. This is the same President who vetoed the Energy and Water appropriations conference report because it contained an environmental rider to which he objected. This is the same President who berated Congress for including legislative riders along with supplemental funding provisions attached to the Military Construction appropriations bill. This is a President who has made it clear time and again that he objects to legislative riders on appropriations bill, and yet he has vowed to veto this conference report because the legislative rider it contains does not go far enough to suit him. 
   Mr. President, the Senate has a responsibility to complete its work--not avoid its work or compromise its work, but complete its work. This conference report is an example of how not to complete the Senate's business. The Commerce-Justice-State bill funds many vitally important programs, and that is why I voted for it. It is a bill that can and should stand on its own merits. It should not be hamstrung by legislative riders or election year politics. 
   Mr. President, the problems that I have cited with this conference report are not a reflection on the Senate Appropriations Committee. Chairman TED STEVENS has done yeoman's work this year to shield the appropriations process from both the Democratic and Republican political agendas. 
   I can compliment equally all of the members of the Appropriations Committee in this respect--the Republicans who chaired the subcommittees and the Democrats who were the ranking members. They all worked together, as they always do. There is no partisanship when it comes to the Appropriations Committee. Republicans and Democrats work together and politics is off the table. That was the case when I was chairman of that committee, and that has been the case since when former Senator Hatfield was chairman and now Senator TED STEVENS of Alaska. Senator STEVENS and I resisted mightily the sledgehammer approach that was used to bring this and other appropriations conference reports to the floor. Senator GREGG and Senator HOLLINGS, the chairman and ranking member of the Commerce-Justice-State Subcommittee, labored diligently to complete work on their bill and bring it to the floor under its own steam. No, the problem with this conference report is not the fault of the Committee but is the result of a breakdown in the legislative system that has seeped--seeped--through the appropriations process this year. The appropriations bills are the victims of this breakdown, not the cause of it. 
   It does not have to be this way, and it should not be this way. The Senate is fully capable of doing its work in an orderly and disciplined manner, capable of drafting, debating, and passing 13 individual appropriations bills, and of completing a separate legislative agenda. 
   Sadly, that is not to be the case this year. Congress is limping slowly toward a long overdue adjournment, leaving behind a trail of unfinished business and the wreckage of the appropriations process. Mr. President, I hope this sorry spectacle will never be repeated. I hope that the clean slate of a new Congress will bring a fresh perspective to next year's appropriations process. I hope and I pray that next year will be different. 
   Mr. President, I thank the distinguished minority whip, Mr. REID, for his never-failing attendance to the business of the Senate. 
   The Bible says: ``Seest now a man diligent in his business? He will stand before kings.'' Senator REID is always diligent in his business. I appreciate his arranging for me to have this time. He is thoroughly dependable and always courteous and considerate to me and to all other Senators. I commend him for it. The people of his State have every right to be proud of him as their senior Senator. And we on our side of the aisle have every right to be proud of him as the minority whip.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Mark Twain said he could live for 2 weeks on a good compliment. The compliment that the distinguished Senator from Nevada, Mr. REID, has just paid me can help me to survive for quite a long time. I shall not forget it. His words are a bit embellished, but I am deeply appreciative of what he has said. 
   I appreciate it very much. I thank him again for his good work every day on the floor of the Senate. Having been whip, I know when we have a good one. And Senator REID is here, looking after the Senate's business, and always very attendant upon our every need. I am ready to vote for him again any time. He does not have to look me up and find out if I am still for him. 
   Mr. President, I thank the Senator.

   Mr. BYRD. I believe that was September 30, 1927. And I believe it was on the 22nd of September 1927 that Jack Dempsey and Gene Tunney fought a fight in which--we who lived in the coalfields hoped Jack Dempsey would win back his title, but he did not win it back. That was the occasion of the ``long count.'' 
   It was in May of that year that Lindbergh flew across the ocean in the Spirit of St. Louis. Sometimes he was 10 feet above the water; sometimes he was 10,000 feet above the water. And his plane had a load, which I remember, of about 500 pounds. He carried five sandwiches, and ate one-half of a sandwich. 
   I remember reading in the New York Times about that historic flight. He said he flew over, I believe, what was Newfoundland, at the great speed of 100 miles per hour--at a great speed, 1927.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I support H.R. 782, the Older Americans Act Amendments of 1999. This legislation, of which I am a cosponsor, has been a long time coming. For five long years, senior citizens have been anxiously awaiting the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act, and seniors in my home state of West Virginia have felt betrayed by the failure of Congress to reauthorize this bill. Betrayed, Mr. President. That is why I am so pleased that, in the final days of the 106th Congress, the Senate has the opportunity to vote on this much-needed legislation. 
   According to the West Virginia Bureau of Senior Services, in Fiscal Year 1999, the Older Americans Act made it possible for approximately 50,459 seniors in West Virginia to have access to vital services like transportation, congregate and home delivered meals, adult day care, and health screenings. In addition, 676 seniors in West Virginia were able to move into the work force through Title V, the Senior Community Service Employment Program. These programs have surely helped many, many seniors, Mr. President, and I am pleased that the Senate is demonstrating how important our nation's oldest citizens are by reauthorizing the Older Americans Act. 
   I am also pleased that this legislation would establish a new National Family Caregiver Support program, which would include respite, adult day care, and home care services for individuals with the greatest social and economic needs. With West Virginia having the country's oldest population for the second year in a row, and with more than fifteen percent of West Virginia's seniors who are age sixty and older considered to be living in a state of poverty, the National Family Caregiver Support program will offer much-needed assistance for home-bound seniors and their families, who are struggling to cope with the emotional and financial burdens placed on them. 
   In June of this year, I was fortunate to attend, and speak at, the first-ever International Conference on Rural Aging, held in my home state of West Virginia. This conference was an historic opportunity for global leaders in the aging community to converge and explore the various challenges facing the exploding senior population, both in the United States and across the globe. Of the many issues that were addressed at the conference, including the lack of access to quality health care and vital services, loss of independence and autonomy, and lack of proper elderly nutrition, I am proud to say that the Older Americans Act offers seniors programs that support their desire to remain in their own homes and live independently. The Older Americans Act gives seniors, in both urban and rural areas, the opportunity to maintain a high-quality of life and the opportunity to feel like active participants in their communities. Among the highest concerns of the elderly in the United States, the need for reauthorization of the Older Americans Act has been labeled a critical priority for keeping pace with the rapidly growing aging population. 
   I would like to point out, Mr. President, that Copernicus was 70 when he argued that the sun, not the Earth, is the center of the cosmos. Grandma Moses was in her 70s when she started painting. Claude Monet painted his famous water lilies at the age of 74. My friend from Ohio, former Senator John Glenn, ventured back into space at the age of 76. Benjamin Franklin was 79 when he invented bifocals. These remarkable individuals were most certainly contributing to society well into what society would consider the ``Golden Years.'' By reauthorizing the Older Americans Act, we are not only giving many other ``golden seniors'' the opportunity to contribute to society, but we are acknowledging the sense that we value them and we are proud to invest in them. I am proud to support this legislation, and I encourage all of my colleagues to do so as well.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Elizabeth Hanahan Oliver was born in Rocky Mount, NC and grew up in Washington, DC where she graduated from George Washington University. 
   ``Beth'' Shotwell, as she was known during much of the time that she worked on Capitol Hill, began her employment in the office of Representative Horace R. Kornegay of North Carolina in the early 1960's. She then joined the staff of Senator Mike Mansfield, later becoming Chief Clerk of the Democratic Policy Committee. She served in that post through the terms of three Democratic Majority Leaders, Senator Mansfield, myself, and Senator George Mitchell. After her marriage to G. Scott Shotwell ended in divorce, she married former Secretary of the Senate, Francis R. ``Frank'' Valeo, in 1985. 
   In 1989, after 27 years of service to the Congress, Beth Shotwell retired. This year on September 22, she passed away at her home in Chevy Chase, Maryland. She had been battling cancer for several years. 
   ``Beth'' Shotwell Valeo was an excellent employee of the Senate. She was a dependable, reliable asset to the members of this body. Her staff loved her and worked hard under her direction. ``Beth'' relished her work and she revered the Senate. 
   She was probably proudest of her contribution to the Commission on the Operation of the Senate, and the efficiency that the recommendations of that Commission brought to this institution. Beth also had a large hand in computerizing the compilation of members' voting records, an innovation which has helped Members and staff immeasurably. 
   On the personal side, Beth was a lover of life with varied interests and a curious intellect. She appreciated music. She liked to needlepoint. She often rescued homeless animals. What a noble person. She enjoyed boating. She liked scuba diving, and she delighted in travel. 
   I shall always remember her as a tall, attractive woman, who seemed disciplined, polite, and very dedicated to her work in the Senate. In her life and in her work she was the best of the best. I was shocked and saddened to hear of her passing at far too young an age. My wife and I extend our deepest condolences to her daughters Rebecca and Abigail, her two sisters Abbie Smith and Ann Duskin, her brother Skip Oliver, Jr. of Fairfax Station, and her husband Frank. 
   In this autumn time of falling leaves, some words from Robert Frost come to mind:  
   Nature's first green is gold, 
   Her hardest hue to hold. 
   Her early leaf's a flower; 
   But only so an hour. 
   Then leaf subsides to leaf. 
   So Eden sank to grief, 
   So dawn goes down to day. 
   Nothing gold can stay.  
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, now before the Senate is the conference report on H.R. 4461, the Fiscal Year 2001 Appropriations bill for Agriculture, Rural Development, the Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies. This conference report includes many items important to West Virginia, and to all states, relating to agricultural research and production, conservation, rural development, food assistance, human health, and many other priority areas. I congratulate Senator THAD COCHRAN, Chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee, and Senator HERB KOHL, Ranking Member, for their hard work in finalizing this very important conference agreement. 
   This conference report provides a total of $74.458 billion in new non-emergency budget authority. This total includes $34.691 billion for agricultural programs (including reimbursement to the Commodity Credit Corporation for net realized losses); $873 million for conservation programs; $2.487 billion for rural development programs; $34.117 billion for domestic food programs; $1.091 billion for international trade assistance programs; and $1.168 billion for related agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration. 
   It is important to note that this conference report includes more than the annual Fiscal Year 2001 appropriations for programs under the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Subcommittee. This conference report also includes $3.642 billion in emergency spending. This funding is related, in large part, to action taken by the Senate Appropriations Committee on May 9, 2000, when the Committee approved Fiscal Year 2000 Supplemental Appropriations. The House of Representatives approved a similar FY-2000 Supplemental Appropriations bill on March 30, 2000. 
   Included in the $3.642 billion in emergency spending are provisions to provide assistance to those who have suffered from natural disasters which have occurred this year and to partially offset certain market losses suffered by the agriculture sector. When  the Appropriations Committee considered supplemental spending more than five months ago, I offered a number of amendments, which were adopted, to provide a timely response to predicted summer drought conditions. One of those provisions would provide $450 million for livestock-related losses, more than double the amount available last year. Another item provided an additional $50 million in loans and grants to provide water supply in rural communities, especially those suffering from drought conditions. I am happy to report that this conference report includes these two items and levels of $490 million and $70 million, respectively. 
   One other item included in this conference report is a provision which I proposed on the subject of compensation to U.S. industries for losses sustained as a result of unfair foreign trade practices. The U.S. agriculture and manufacturing sectors have been able to avail themselves of legal remedies to challenge foreign actions, but have not had adequate means to recover from the losses resulting from those actions. Now, such a mechanism will be in place and U.S. farmers and workers of all trades affected by unfair trade practices will be able, in essence, to recover monetarily rather than simply having the right to file a complaint. 
   This extra step is necessary. Current law has simply not been strong enough to deter unfair trading practices, whether in the agriculture or manufacturing industries. Continued foreign dumping and subsidy practices have reduced the ability of our injured domestic industries to reinvest in their workers, equipment, or technology. My provision simply provides a mechanism to help injured U.S. industries recover from the harmful effects of illegal foreign dumping and subsidies. And, most importantly, if our foreign trading partners play by the rules, my provision will never have to be used. 
   Mr. President, this conference report includes many items important to all Americans, and I am happy to support it. Action on this measure is long overdue. Disaster assistance is badly needed to help people all across the nation who are suffering from drought, storms, floods, and crop loss due to infestations of pests and disease. I urge all my colleagues to join me in support of this conference agreement.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Americans are rightfully horrified and alarmed at the news reports and stories about so-called ``child soldiers'' pressed into service in paramilitary armies around the world. In Cambodia, the Sudan, Lebanon, and elsewhere, we gaze into the hard-eyed stares of barefoot ten-year-olds cradling well-worn rifles and machine guns. These children have known nothing but violence. It is hard to imagine how they will ever be able to move beyond such violence, should peace ever be established in their homelands. They do not know how to live under the rule of law, only under the rule of might makes right. They have a very casual attitude about killing other human beings. 
   We certainly would not want our own children to experience such a life, and we would not want such a generation of casual killers to grow up amongst us. Yet, in the midst of all of our affluence, we are rearing a generation that is appallingly casual about violence, a generation that is appallingly self-centered about getting--or taking--what they want. Too many of our children live lives heavily influenced by a completely unrealistic set of expectations and examples. In the movies, when something bad happens to someone, does he or she turn to the police for help and then retire to the background  while the police deal with the problem? No, of course not. Our hero grabs a gun and gives chase. Bullets fly, explosions and car crashes ensue, and the audience is treated to every gory detail. There is no fading to black anymore to let our imaginations fill in the details. No, our hero leaves a bloody trail of death and destruction in his wake and goes home with the girl--and none of those details are left to our imagination, either. 
   Now, instead of the aforementioned action-adventure, one could opt instead for some other movie genre but many are worse. Horror movies have taken violence against the innocent to new, ever-more-squeamish lows. The realistic and grisly visuals are, no doubt, a tribute to the talents of makeup and special-effects artists, but, nevertheless, I remain unconvinced that putting these nightmares on the silver screen does anything but tarnish the screen and the imaginations of the viewers. Some of the subject matter in these films is so misogynistic, so filled with contempt for societal order, and so filled with invective and hate, that it should set the alarm bells ringing in peaceable folks and incite them to demand greater responsibility from the entertainment industry. 
   I have always instinctively, intuitively felt that people who can look with equanimity on this kind of violence, even on screen or on the radio, might themselves be open to such action. In fact, this does seem to be the case in practice. We surround our children with these so-called ``role models,'' and then, for amusement--and I use that term lightly--we let our children play games in which they get to act out this lifestyle. 
   What are we doing? We send our children the message that real life is dull, and that this is what we do for fun. We allow them to watch so-called movie stars create mayhem without ever facing the consequences. Then we allow our children to listen to music that may also be filled with violent lyrics. Then we let our children amuse themselves by play-acting that they are the killers. We allow them to have hours, sometimes, of simulated target practice--and we pay for the privilege. Should we then be surprised when our children come to believe that violence against others is just one stop along the continuum of acceptable behavior? 
   Our children may go to school every day. They may have a roof over their heads at night. Perhaps they have nice clothes to wear. They may have parents who love them. They may have, in short, everything, but they have, in too many cases, developed the same hard-eyed stare that those Cambodian child soldiers have. They have developed the same casual attitude 
   about violence and in far too many cases, they act out these violent impulses, with tragic results. 
   I have long shared the concerns of many parents and grandparents that young people are being exposed to far too much violence through the media--through the movies, through television, rock music--if you can call it music--and video games. The entertainment industry, however, has generally rebuffed criticism about the content of its programs and products, and about concerns that too much exposure to violence is harmful to our young people. The industry, in fact, has repeatedly claimed to be making efforts to reduce the exposure of young people to violence, including instituting a system of labeling program content so that parents are supposedly better able to evaluate the programs, and video games and what goes for music that their children watch and play. 
   Now it seems as though the entertainment industry has been caught with its hand in the cookie jar. 
   Just a few days ago, the Federal Trade Commission--the agency responsible for enforcing consumer protection laws--released a report finding that the entertainment industry aggressively markets violence-ridden materials directly to young people. This report details how companies, on the one hand, stamp ``mature audience'' ratings on their products that contain violent material, while on the other hand, these same companies peddle these ``mature''-rated products to young people. 
   Let me just read a passage of the FTC report: ``Two plans for games developed in 1998 described its target audience as `Males 17-34 due to M rating. The true target is males 12-34.' '' In other words, not 17 to 34, but 12 to 34. There it is--in black and white! Video game marketers acknowledge that they are giving a quick wink to their own standards and then they state their true target. This is especially significant since only the electronic game industry has adopted a rule prohibiting its marketers from targeting advertising for games to children below the age designations indicated by their rating. So the FTC has knocked a huge hole in the industry's pious statements of concern by highlighting its hypocritical marketing practices. 
   You may recall to memory the story of Hansel and Gretel--a story that is not without its own share of violence. Just as Hansel and Gretel were enchanted by the evil witch's gingerbread house, our children are dazzled by the entertainment industry's lurid images. The industry beckons our children with advertising and once they are in the industry's clutches, the children are fattened up with more violent material. Of course, in the story of Hansel and Gretel, the children realize they are about to be cooked and eaten, and they trick the witch and shove her into the oven. Would we could do that with the entertainment industry. But I am not suggesting that we shove the entertainment industry into the oven--but perhaps we do need to turn up the heat! 
   The impact of media violence on our children is of great concern. Numerous studies conducted by the nation's top universities in the past three decades have come to the same conclusion: namely, there is at least some demonstrable link between watching violent acts in movies, television shows, or video games and acting aggressively in life. 
   As parents, policymakers, and citizens and legislators, we should all be worried about this. The amount of entertainment violence witnessed by American children is alarming. 
   Film makers, striving to turn profits in the competitive film industry, display more and more explicit violence, and programmers devise increasingly violent computer and video games that have children take on roles in which they are rewarded for the number of enemies they kill. Is it any wonder, then, that children become numb to the horrors they witness daily in their entertainment? Is it a surprise that these same children have a world view that incorporates violence as an acceptable means for settling conflict? Of course not. 
   If the industry is unwilling to address the concerns of parents by continuing to market inappropriate material to children, and then to broadcast that material at times when children are most likely to be watching, then I think it is incumbent upon Congress to act. We cannot be passive about this issue. We cannot say how awful it is--``How awful''--but then fail to take action. If the entertainment industry will not act responsibly, if the industry will not work with parents to craft commonsense approaches to curbing inappropriate programming, then it will fall to Congress to address the situation. Will it? Reducing the violence placed before America's children in the guise of entertainment is an important task. Images seen in childhood help to shape attitudes for a lifetime. 
   I know that I am not alone in recognizing the threat to our society created by producing our own generation of child soldiers, of young people indifferent to the suffering they cause by their violent acts. This FTC report merely provides evidence that, like the tobacco companies, the violent entertainment industry is targeting our children to build a nation, not of addicts, but of indifference to excessive violence. We cannot let this continue. But will we? 
   If the entertainment industry cannot abide by, and will not enforce, voluntary guidelines to regulate media violence, then it is time for the rest of us to insist that those guidelines be enforced. 
   That might be a good question for tonight's debate. I wonder if all the questions have already been determined. Why not some questions of this nature? 
   I realize that legislation to address this issue is unlikely to see action in the very few days remaining in this Congress. In fact, I would not like to rush such legislation and risk doing it poorly. Of course, it will not be done and cannot be done in the few days that remain. I would rather finish the  critical appropriations work that still remains. But I do hope that this report will not be lost in Olympic and election hoopla. I intend to revisit this issue next year, and I hope that other Members will join me in a sincere and bipartisan effort to find a way to protect our children and our society. 
   It is the same old story, Mr. President, the same old story. We talk about it. We wring our hands. We wail and gnash our teeth and moan and groan about the entertainment industry. But we welcome those contributions from the entertainment industry. They are great. They are great. But we are paying for it with the denigration of our children. 
   When will America awaken? When will the candidates be asked piercing questions about their stands on matters such as this? I would like to hear their answers. Tonight, in that townhall meeting, would be a good place for those, wouldn't it? 
   What are you going to do, Mr. Candidate, about the entertainment industry? How much money have you already accepted? Are you going to accept money from the entertainment industry? If you do, then how can you turn around and do something in the interests of our children? A good question. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as all Senators are aware, I have taken the floor on a number of occasions, not only this year, but over the past several years, to express my concern about the manner in which the Senate was disposing of certain appropriation bills. This year--as in three previous fiscal years, fiscal years 1997, 1999, and 2000--the Senate has, until today, again been unable to take up and debate and amend several fiscal year 2001 appropriations bills; namely, Treasury/General Government, VA/HUD, and Commerce/Justice/State appropriations bills. I have been deeply concerned that the Senate is in danger of becoming a mere adjunct of the House, when it comes to consideration of appropriations bills. 
   In light of the circumstances in which we find ourselves, so near the end of the 106th Congress, I was pleased to support the unanimous consent agreement entered into yesterday. Under that agreement, the Senate has before it this morning the Fiscal Year 2001 VA/HUD Appropriations bill, as amended by the Senate Appropriations Committee. That Committee-reported bill has been amended by a Committee  substitute offered by Senators BOND and MIKULSKI. Despite the fact that the Senate has not taken up the VA/HUD Appropriations bill until today, the fact is that Chairman BOND and Ranking Member MIKULSKI have worked tirelessly on the substitute before the Senate today. They have worked with the Administration and the other body to pound out an agreement that is acceptable to all parties involved in those negotiations. So, I am pleased that the many hours that they have devoted to this effort have resulted in the agreement now about to be adopted by the Senate. As is always the case, when it comes to appropriations bills, no one is fully satisfied with the final agreements that are reached. I am sure that there are areas where members would prefer to see changes made, but the time has come and gone for us to complete our work on the Fiscal Year 2001 appropriations bills--a fiscal year which began some 12 days ago. 
   Mr. President, as I explained earlier in my remarks, the Senate, until today, had not taken up the VA/HUD bill, or the Treasury/General Government bill, or the Commerce/Justice/State bill. The amendment at the desk places before the Senate the Committee-reported FY-2001 Treasury/General Government Appropriations bill. 
   This is the only opportunity that the Senate has had to consider the Treasury/General Government Appropriations bill, other than its being presented to the Senate on September 14th in a combined Legislative Branch and Treasury/General Government conference report, which was unamendable. The inclusion of the Treasury/General Government appropriations in the Legislative Branch conference report was not amendable and precluded the Senate's opportunity to debate and amend the Treasury/General Government bill on the Senate floor. Instead, on September 14th, Senators were asked to vote on the unamendable conference report, which contained not only the Legislative Branch Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2001, but also the Treasury/General Government Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2001. The vote on that combined conference report was 28 yeas and 69 nays. The motion to reconsider that vote is still pending. 
   Mr. President, it is my understanding that several adjustments to that Legislative Branch and Treasury/General Government conference report have been made in the form of amendments to the Transportation Appropriations bill, which were adopted in conference and were included as part of the Transportation conference report, which has now passed both Houses of Congress and is awaiting the President's signature. I do not intend to discuss those amendments in detail at this time, but instead will point out that a concern by Senator REID regarding the selection of a chief administrative officer for the Capitol Police has been resolved in that Transportation conference, together with substantial increases in funding for the IRS and certain other matters pertaining to the Treasury/General Government portion of that combined conference report. 
   As a result of these amendments regarding the Legislative Branch and Treasury/General Government conference report, it is my understanding that that conference report is now acceptable to the Chairmen and Ranking Members of those two Subcommittees, and I believe it is the intention of the Leadership to bring up and dispose of that combined Legislative Branch and Treasury/General Government conference report immediately following completion of consideration of the VA/HUD Appropriations conference report, which is currently before the Senate. 
   Mr. President, I urged the Leaders to allow for the amendment to put before the Senate the Treasury/General Government Appropriations bill, as reported by the Appropriations Committee, in order to preserve, at least to some extent, the Senate's right to take up appropriations bills prior to their being inserted into unamendable conference reports. I appreciate that the Leaders accommodated my request. Although, under the unanimous consent agreement, there will be no opportunity to amend the Treasury/General Government Appropriations bill, at least we have preserved the Senate's right to consider it. I am encouraged by the fact that the Majority Leader, at this late hour of the session, has attempted, as best he could, to allow some semblance of Senate consideration of the VA/HUD and the Treasury/General Government appropriations bills. I am hopeful that a similar agreement can be reached on the one remaining appropriations bill which the Senate has not yet acted upon--the Commerce/Justice/State Appropriations bill. 
   I am also very hopeful that we can find a way to ensure that the Senate can return to the regular appropriations process in the next Congress and all congresses thereafter, whereby appropriations bills are reported by the Committee and taken up in the Senate for debate and amendment prior to their being inserted into unamendable conference reports.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, consideration of the annual Defense Authorization conference report is generally an occasion for celebration and congratulation in the Senate as we reflect on the strength and superiority of America's armed forces. The report that we are considering today is indeed a solid achievement in our efforts to keep this nation on the right track as we work to bolster America's military readiness and national security. 
   Unfortunately, the circumstances under which we are taking up this report offer no cause to celebrate. The United States today is mourning the loss of at least five American sailors, a death toll likely to rise, and the injury of dozens more in an apparent terrorist attack on the destroyer U.S.S. Cole in Aden, Yemen. At the same time, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are in chaos as the escalating violence between the Israelis and the Palestinians threatens to erupt into all-out war. 
   Our thoughts and our prayers are with the crew of the Cole and their families, and with the entire Navy family. The attack on the Cole was a vile and contemptible act. We must leave no stone unturned in working to determine the origins of this attack, to bring those responsible to justice, and to redouble our efforts to protect our forces overseas. And we must renew our calls to the Palestinian and Israeli leaders to quell the violence in the Middle East, to stop the fighting between the two sides from spiraling out of control. Too many lives have been lost already in this latest round of violence, too many children have been sacrificed to the disputes of their governments. It is time for the Israelis and Palestinians to each accept responsibility for their actions, to stop the fighting, and to resume talking. 
   These grave crises are a stark reminder of the importance of maintaining a strong and ready U.S. military, and the FY 2001 Defense Authorization conference report that we considering today does a good job in meeting that goal. Like the Defense Appropriations conference report that was passed earlier this year, this authorization measure provides needed funding increases and policy directives to meet the changing nature of our national security challenges and to respond to crises affecting our national security as they arise. 
   With the current focus on the readiness of America's military, this is a timely package that makes a clear statement about the Senate's commitment to our men and women in uniform. There is no question that this is a big bill, topping out at $309.9 billion--$4.6 billion over the President's budget request. It is a broad and complex measure, affecting virtually every facet of our nation's military forces and readiness capabilities. It has not been an easy task to finalize the conference and reach this point. Many controversial issues had to be confronted and resolved along the way. Conferees began their work before the August recess, and have labored intensely over the past several weeks to complete the conference. I commend our Chairman, Senator WARNER, and Ranking Member, Senator LEVIN, for their guidance, skill, and leadership during the conference. While not every Senator may agree with every provision of this conference report, all Senators can be assured, thanks to the leadership of Senators WARNER and LEVIN, that the conferees never lost sight of the essential purpose of this legislation, which is to provide for America's national security and military readiness.  
   I am particularly pleased that the authorizers concurred with the appropriators in funding a 3.7 percent pay raise for military personnel. We can never adequately compensate our men and women in uniform for their dedication and service to this nation, but we must always strive to provide the best pay and benefits package that we can. In that regard, I also welcome the comprehensive package of improved health benefits for Medicare-eligible military retirees, although I understand the concern that has been raised over the cost of the so-called ``TRICARE for life'' provision that was included in this conference report. The cost of health care for aging Americans, be they military or civilian retirees, is an issue that this nation is going to have to confront, and that Congress will have to provide for in future budgets. I have no doubt that whatever we do, as we have seen in this measure, the price tag will be steep. 
   I am also pleased that the conferees agreed to accept the provision that I offered on behalf of myself, Senator WARNER and Senator LEVIN establishing a United States-China Security Review Commission to monitor and assess the national security implications of the U.S.-China trade relationship. In the wake of the recent enactment of legislation to extend Permanent Normal Trade Relations to China, this Commission can play a key role in assuring that an enhanced economic relationship between the United States and China does not undermine our national security interests. 
   The purpose of the U.S. China Security Review Commission is to determine whether China, which is working hard to gain entry to the World Trade Organization, or WTO, and to extend its economic dominance throughout the hemisphere, will use its enhanced trade status within the WTO and income from increased international trade to compromise the national security of the United States. Given the circumstances--including the fact that the Chinese Central Committee just this week approved an economic plan that calls for doubling China's economy over the next decade--this is a timely and serious issue to address. 
   Mr. President, we have good reason to be wary. I think it is significant that even before the President signed the PNTR legislation into law, the Chinese started waffling on promises they had made to secure entry to the World Trade Organization. I note that the President's top trade negotiator was dispatched to Beijing this week, shortly after the PNTR signing ceremony, to attempt to nail down China's commitment to reduce tariffs on imports and open markets to foreign companies. 
   Let me read from an item in Wednesday's New York Times, entitled ``Clinton Warns China to Abide by Trade Rules.'' 
   I will read from the article.  
   Mr. Clinton sent Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, on her mission on the same day that he signed into law the legislation to grant China permanent normal trade relations, the culmination of 14 years of negotiations and a protracted struggle on Capital Hill. 
   But even as administration officials and bipartisan Congressional leaders gathered on the White House lawn to hail what they called China's integration into the world economy, American officials acknowledged that China was slipping on pledges to open its markets that it had made as part of its efforts to join the World Trade Organization.  
   I wish I could say I was surprised by China's apparent backing away from its WTO commitments, but I was not. I predicted this. China's record on trade agreements is abysmal. Since 1992, six trade agreements have been made, and broken, by China. In addition to its record of broken promises on trade agreements, China also has a history of weapons proliferation, religious repression, poor labor protections, and aggressive foreign policy postures. Is this the kind of behavior we want to reward with permanent normal trade relations? 
   I opposed PNTR for China, and I have grave reservations over the impact of China's membership in the WTO. We are entering uncharted waters in our economic relationship with China, and it is absolutely essential that we do so with our eyes open. We gave away our only means to bring the issue of trade with China before the Congress on an annual basis when we passed PNTR. 
   I believe there were 13 Senators who had their eyes open when they voted on that matter and they voted against it. I was one of the 13. 
   This U.S.-China Security Review Commission will restore a vital measure of scrutiny to the economic relationship between the United States and China. It is a fundamental safeguard, and I am glad that we are moving forward with it. 
   It is not a trade commission. It is a national security commission. 
   Let's have some group that will advise the Congress as to what impact the trade engaged in by China with the United States might have on our national security. We are not depending upon the administration. We are not depending upon the executive branch. We have a commission that will advise the Congress so that we will know, we will have some idea as to what the impact on national security is of this permanent normal trade relations legislation. 
   So it is a fundamental safeguard, and I am glad that we are moving forward with it. 
   Once again, we stand at a time when tensions throughout the world are high. In the span of only a few days, we have ricocheted from the euphoria of democracy--this is the way of making China a democratic nation. We will have great influence upon China. It is laughable that we, the people of 212 years, will have influence upon the people of 5,000 years. No. We have ricocheted from the euphoria of democracy sweeping through Yugoslavia, to the despair of escalating violence in the Mideast, to the horrific images of dead and injured American soldiers on the U.S.S. Cole, the victims of an apparent anti-American terrorist attack. We are reminded that peace remains an elusive goal, and that America must remain vigilant. 
   The first order of business is to ensure that the United States maintains the finest, the best equipped, the best protected, and the best managed military in the world; a military force--but we will have to make it all of these things--a military force suited for the emerging challenges of the 21st century. This conference report goes a long way to meet that test. It is a good package. 
   I urge its adoption, and I again commend Senators WARNER and LEVIN for having led the way for others of the conferees to the final development of this package. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we have all heard the phrase that in this world--especially in this body--there are workhorses and there are show horses. That is very true. I would like to reflect on one of the workhorses of the Senate who will be retiring at the end of this Congress, someone who has served his State, served his country, and served in this body with distinction. 
   Theodore Roosevelt once said, ``Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.'' Senator BRYAN, one of the workhorses of the Senate, has made the most of his chance to work hard at work worth doing. 
   In addition to serving his constituents well, Senator BRYAN also has served the Senate well. He was asked to serve on the ad hoc committee that took testimony in the impeachment trial of U.S. District Judge ALCEE L. HASTINGS in 1989. In 1991, in the aftermath of the Keating Five scandal, Senate leaders named Senator BRYAN to a new task force to decide where to draw the line of propriety in such situations. His steady service helped to restore public confidence in the Senate, shaken by that troubling incident. 
   During the 103rd Congress, he was chairman of the Ethics Committee when the committee began an investigation into charges of sexual harassment leveled against former Senator Bob Packwood. Serving on the Ethics Committee is a thankless task. No Senator ever asks to serve on that committee. It does not generate the appreciation of constituents, nor does it particularly endear a Senator to his colleagues. This is important work, however--work that protects the integrity of this body. And as one who has great respect for this 
   institution, I appreciate the exemplary job that Senator BRYAN did in steering the Senate through some tumultuous times. 
   Senator BRYAN has used his position in the U.S. Senate not only to advocate for his constituents in the great State of Nevada but also to protect consumers across the Nation. Ten years  ago, as the chairman of the Commerce Committee's Consumer Subcommittee, Senator BRYAN oversaw the first stand-alone reauthorization of the Consumer Product Safety Commission since 1981. This was a hard-earned victory for consumers nationwide. Senator BRYAN was also successful in securing passage of legislation that he authored requiring the installation of passenger-side airbags in all automobiles sold in this country, a safety feature responsible for saving hundreds of lives. 
   Senator RICHARD BRYAN's career has been one of true and diligent public service. I am told that his experience in elected office began when he was chosen to be president of his eighth grade class at John S. Park Elementary School. He served in the U.S. Army, completing his military service in the Army Reserves as a captain. Upon completion of law school, RICHARD BRYAN returned to Nevada and began a career in public service that has spanned more than three decades. In 1964, Mr. BRYAN became a deputy district attorney in the Clark County District Attorney's Office. Two years later, he was appointed Clark County's first public defender. His legislative service to Nevada began in 1968 when he was elected to the Nevada State Assembly. Following a second term in the State Assembly, he was elected to the Nevada State Senate in 1972 and was reelected in 1976. 
   Senator BRYAN won his first statewide election to become Nevada's attorney general in 1978. He served as the State's chief law enforcement officer until 1982, when he was elected to the first of two terms as Nevada's 26th Governor. In 1988, Senator BRYAN ran for the U.S. Senate, defeating the incumbent Senator, and went on to be reelected to the Senate in 1994. That is a very respected and impressive record, Mr. President--a life devoted to public service at virtually every level of our government. 
   Senator BRYAN leaves the Senate as a young man--youth being relative. As I look back on his many years of public service, I am confident that in whatever endeavor he chooses next, we can expect more fine work--work worth doing--from Senator BRYAN. He is a man who can always be proud to look at himself in the mirror each morning. He will see a reflection of fine work in the past, as well as the great opportunity to do well each day. 
   Mr. President, I wish RICHARD BRYAN and his lovely wife every good thing in the years ahead. I hope he will come back to see us often. 
   Mr. President, before I was recognized, I saw another Senator on the floor and I think he was about to seek recognition. I suggested that he go ahead and get recognition. But he suggested that I get recognition. So I did. If my friend, the Senator from Wyoming, wishes to be recognized, I will be very glad to yield the floor. I have a couple of other speeches, but I will be happy to listen to him before I continue.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, my State of West Virginia has provided to our Nation numerous individuals who have dedicated their lives to public service. Some have appeared, for a time, in the national spotlight. Others have labored quietly behind the scenes. One such individual, who has for more than 50 years contributed to the betterment of his community, his State, and his country, sits among us today in this  Senate Chamber. Arthur Malan St. Clair, the senior Doorkeeper of the Senate, caught me by surprise recently when he handed me a letter informing me of his decision to retire from his post after serving this body since 1979. 
   Arthur St. Clair, better known to us Senators as ``Tinker,'' has served the Senate with distinction for 21 years. 
   But that is just a small part of his remarkable story. Now, speculation as to the age of another person is always something to be approached with some temerity, and not often approached, as a matter of fact. But there has been speculation as to Tinker's age. It has been a hot topic of debate among some Senators and Senator's staffs for a number of years. I understand, however, that Tinker is finally willing to let that particular cat out of the bag. 
   So, for the benefit of the curious, I shall start at the beginning: Tinker St. Clair was born in Pageton, McDowell County, West Virginia, in 1916. As his colleagues on the doors may be quickly calculating, that will make Tinker 85 years come next January. 
   Tinker was the son of a coal miner, small businessman, and local school board member. He was reared in what he is often heard to call the ``free State of McDowell.'' 
   It is a county located in southern West Virginia right on the borderline there. It used to have a population of about right at 100,000 people. Today it has probably 30,000. It was a great coal mining county. When the mines took on mechanization and huge mining machines took the place of men, the population dropped. Many of the mines are worked out and are no longer mining coal. So it has become a county that, unfortunately, has many unemployed people who still live there. 
   That county is represented by NICK JOE RAHALL, who claims to be my Congressman because my voting residence is still at Sophia, WV, which is located in the congressional district represented by NICK RAHALL. NICK RAHALL has a lot of friends in those counties, and they are very proud of him as their representative. NICK and I often talk about Tinker St. Clair. 
   Tinker is from that great free state of McDowell. Back in those days, when McDowell County had almost 100,000 people, West Virginia had 97,600 farms and had 90,000 horses. The State of West Virginia had 90,000 horses and 6,000 mules. That was back in the days when Tinker was younger, I was younger, and McDowell County was more highly populated. Many of those 6,000 mules were used in the mines to pull the cars of coal. 
   I was trying to remember how much money was required to build that first capitol in West Virginia--not the first capitol; the first capitol burned down, but the capitol that replaced the capitol that burned down had gold leaf put upon it. That capitol was completed in February 1932. I will tell you what that capitol cost in 1932. Pay close attention: $9,491,180.03. That was the total cost of that capitol. Any person traveling in West Virginia must stop and see that beautiful capitol. It would cost many times that much to build it today. It was completed in the heart of the Great Depression: $9,491,180.03. That was a real bargain. 
   Well, McDowell County is in the heart of a region that is rich in coal and, more importantly, rich in the old values. It was in that environment that Tinker grew up. That was the environment in which he was raised. That was the environment in which he was instilled with patriotism and loyalty, honesty and determination and drive, and a strong sense of community. 
   Tinker graduated in 1937. That was the year in which I married. That was the year in which Erma and I married. I paid a hard-shell preacher $10 to marry her and me. We have been married ever since, 63 years ago. Nineteen hundred and thirty-seven was the year Tinker graduated from Gary High School where he played football and baseball. 
   Upon graduation, Tinker worked as a schoolbus driver and later worked as a driver for the Consolidated Bus Lines. He came to own a taxi business that operated in the towns of Welch, Oceana, and Pineville. For anyone unfamiliar with those communities, I should note that driving a bus or a taxi along those particular local roads, around the winding hills and in the gulches and the valleys and the hollows, requires a real talent, courage, and certainly a strong stomach. 
   It was at about that time in his life--in fact, on May 25, 1940--that Tinker married Elnora J. Hall 
   and they later became the proud parents of two daughters, Patty and Linda. 
   As we have all observed in the Senate, and as I have known for many years, Tinker is always cheerful--always cheerful. He always has a nice smile on his face. He is always a very personable individual. He is just down to Earth, a plain, honest, hard-working, fine Christian gentleman. 
   He is a ``people person.'' We hear a lot of talk these days about ``people persons.'' Well, he is a ``people person.'' His entrance into the realm of politics and public service, therefore, was just plain natural. Beginning in 1948, Tinker's career included service as a deputy sheriff. When Tinker came to get you, you better go--you better go. He had that big .45 slung on his hip and he was an excellent marksman. You just better go; better get ready. That fellow, the smiles, was the real Matt Dillon of McDowell County--Matt Dillon. And he was a court bailiff, criminal investigator for the prosecuting attorney, and justice of the peace. 
   In 1968, Tinker was elected county clerk, and he has held all the offices at the county level. That is where government starts, you know, at the county level. And he was overwhelmingly reelected in 1974, with 89 percent of the vote; 89 percent of the votes in a county that never, ever heard of a political machine. 
   Well, I better take that back, the part about a political machine; If there ever was a political machine, that was it, in McDowell County. 
   Well, anyhow, Tinker didn't need any machine. He had the votes--89 percent of the vote while running on the slogan, ``The man to give the office back to the people.'' How about that for a slogan? If I had my political career to start over again, that is the slogan I would use, ``The man to give the office back to the people.'' 
   It was in 1979, after serving 4 years of a 6-year term as county clerk, I received a telephone call. I will never forget that call. It came from Tinker. Over the phone, Tinker related to me a conversation that he had just had with Elnora. Elnora, as I recall it, had told Tinker that she was coming to Washington to visit their daughters and their grandchildren. 
   ``Fine,'' said Tinker. ``When will you be coming back?'' 
   ``I'm not,'' was the answer. ``I'm not.'' She went on to say, ``I miss the girls and the grandchildren and I'm going to Washington to stay.'' 
   Well, Tinker and I both knew that she meant business. And so I said to Tinker, ``Well, you just come on up to Washington with Elnora, and we'll find work in my office somewhere for you.'' 
   That conversation took place during the first week of July, 1979. And on July 9, 1979, the Senate employed Tinker St. Clair as the newest member of our Senate family, and he has been a member of the Senate family ever since. 
   During his career, Tinker has played an important role in escorting leaders of this Nation throughout southern West Virginia. Nobody can escort one through southern West Virginia quite like Tinker. He walked with President Truman through the coal fields. He stood with candidate John F. Kennedy and campaigned with him in the hills and the hollows of West Virginia. And one time back home, he greeted a helicopter that was landing and he welcomed its passenger, Lyndon Baines Johnson. He was with another Kennedy--Bobby Kennedy--in 
   1968. 
   He traveled with another West Virginian, many times, day and night: ROBERT C. BYRD. He traveled with JAY ROCKEFELLER. And JAY can tell of trips to Welch where he was greeted by the dapper and dedicated Tinker. And the late Senator Jennings Randolph often found at Elnora's supper table some fine pastries and goodies. And so was NICK RAHALL there, from time to time, in Tinker's house. 
   Many a campaign strategy was cooked up at Elnora's supper table. Tinker and Elnora, in fact, serve as proof that anyone with the determination and the desire to make a difference in this Nation can play a valuable role in the political arena. 
   It was on April 24, 1996, that Tinker lost his beloved Elnora. I was concerned for my friend. The sudden loss of his dear wife had to have been quite  a blow. Yet Tinker handled that difficult personal tragedy with tremendous inner strength that is so indicative of people who have come up the hard way in West Virginia's coal mining communities. 
   So now it has come to pass, Mr. President, that Tinker St. Clair will be retiring, and I am glad for him that he will be able to spend more time with his daughters, Patty and Linda; and with his grandchildren, Kimberly and Eddie and Mack; and with his two great-grandsons, Nicholas and Jack. 
   But I must admit, it does sadden me to think of our daily labors in this Chamber without Tinker; He has given so much. We will all miss Tinker's ready smile, his warm handshake, his full head of white hair, and his warm and reassuring presence in the Senate Chamber. 
   He won't be leaving for a while yet, but the day will come when Tinker will walk out of the door for his last time. So I say goodbye to my fellow West Virginian, and my dear friend, with these words of verse: 
   Word to the Living It isn't enough that we say in our hearts That we like a man for his ways; And it isn't enough that we fill our minds With psalms of silent praise; Nor is it enough that we honor a man As our confidence upward mounts; It's going right up to the man himself And telling him so that counts. Then when a man does a deed that you really admire, Don't leave a kind word unsaid, For fear to do so might make him vain Or cause him to lose his head; But reach out your hand and tell him, ``Well done'', And see how his gratitude swells; It isn't the flowers we strew on the grave, It's the word to the living that tells.  
   I will say this to Tinker. I hope to serve 6 years more after this year in this Senate, but the sight of him back there on that bench will never fade from my view. I will always see him there. I will always see him returning my gaze and always with a smile. We will never, never forget him because he is the true symbol of service. And as the old saying goes: Service with a smile. Thank you.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate has lost an honored and esteemed friend. I rise to pay tribute to Murray Zweben, former Senate Parliamentarian, Senate Parliamentarian Emeritus, who passed away on a Sunday recently. 
   A few years before his own death, Thomas Jefferson wrote in a letter to John Adams:  
   It is of some comfort to us both that the term is not very distant at which we are to deposit in the same cerement our sorrows and suffering bodies, and to ascend in essence to an ecstatic meeting with the friends we have loved and lost, and whom we shall still love and never lose again.  
   As we reflect upon and mourn the passing of Murray Zweben, these words remind us that death is but a temporary separation between this life and the next life. While we regret the loss of dear friends, and especially one who so ably served this body for many years, we can contemplate with assurance that there is the promise that we can be reunited.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as the 106th Congress winds to a close, I want to take just a moment, as it were, to say farewell and to pay tribute to my friend and colleague, Senator FRANK LAUTENBERG, who, after serving three terms, will be retiring from the United States Senate. He has dutifully served the people of New Jersey, and served them well, for 18 years, and he has often been outspoken about the value of government and its ability to improve people's lives. 
   This belief stems from personal experience. As the son of immigrants who fled poverty and religious persecution, he raised himself from poverty to become a world leader in computer services. FRANK did well. He well understood the words of Thomas H. Huxley, who said, ``The rung of a ladder was never meant to rest upon, but only to hold a man's foot long enough to enable him to put the other somewhat higher.'' Senator FRANK LAUTENBERG has never rested, and I am sure that, for him, retirement from the Senate simply means that he is moving on to the next rung on his life's ladder.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on Wednesday, September 20, the Senate lost one of its own family members. Not a member with a capital ``M,'' elected by the people, but an unpaid, unsung, but O so important member of the Senate family. On Wednesday, Maureen Mansfield, the beloved wife of former majority leader Mike Mansfield, passed away. 
   It is safe to say that without the efforts, energy, dedication, and love of Maureen Mansfield, the Senate and the people of Montana might never have benefited from the extraordinary talents of Mike Mansfield. Like myself, Mike was raised by an aunt and uncle after the death of his mother when he was just 3 years old. During the First World War, Mike Mansfield dropped out of school and joined the Navy, and he also served with the Army and the Marine Corps. 
   Upon his return to Montana, he worked as a mucker in the copper mines and did not resume the schooling he had left in the eighth grade. 
   Maureen, a high school teacher when her younger sister introduced her to Mike, encouraged him to return to school. She helped him to apply to Montana State University and helped him complete his high school equivalency courses before completing college. She cashed in her life insurance and worked as a social worker in order to support her husband in school. Then both of them went on to earn Master's degrees. Maureen Mansfield did not believe, and disproved, the old saw that you cannot change a man and that all efforts to do so are futile. 
   Mike Mansfield's congressional career also benefitted from Maureen Mansfield's support. Maureen would campaign for Mike in Montana, sometimes on her own when Mike could not get away from Washington. Mike Mansfield served five terms in the House before his first election to the Senate. In the Senate, Lyndon Johnson picked Mike for party whip. 
   In those days, it was different from what it is now because a leader would not pick another Member for the office of party whip. That is a matter that the Members will resolve. 
   Mike went on to serve as Majority Leader himself for sixteen years, longer than any other Senator. I served as his party whip. I continued to hold Mike Mansfield in the highest respect. Mike and Maureen have always been good friends to me and Erma, and we will both miss their companionship and the very deep affection and esteem with which they treated each other, and which sustained them through 68 years of marriage. 
   Erma and I have 5 more years to go before we can say we have been married 68 years. But Mike and Maureen set an example as an exemplary creative family in that regard. 
   Mike Mansfield never lost his appreciation for his wife's support. He always readily gave Maureen the credit that he felt she was due and which I, having enjoyed the same kind of love and support from my wife, readily endorse. These talented, organized, gracious women, such as Maureen Mansfield and Erma Byrd, could have commanded armies. They could have run universities or won Senate seats in their own right. But they chose instead to hitch their stars to the wagons of their husbands. And Mike Mansfield and I are definitely the better for it. I believe, too, that the nation is better off as result as well. 
   The demands of the Senate, particularly the demands placed upon Majority Leaders, are stressful, time-consuming, and exhausting. 
   It is even more than a two-person job. I could concentrate on Senate matters knowing that Erma was there at home to support me and to give the love, affection, and attention to our two daughters that they so much deserved. I am here to say that one old adage is certainly true, and we have all heard it many times. That is, behind any great man is an even greater woman. To the extent that I ever wanted to be great, I have been denied that. But I can say that I have Erma to thank for whatever I have been able to accomplish. I know Mike Mansfield would say the same about Maureen. 
   Now that Maureen has found new life in the shelter of God's hand, I hope that Mike, his daughter Anne, and his granddaughter might sympathize with the words of ``The Beyond,'' penned by Ella Wheeler Wilcox (1855-1919): 
 It seemeth such a little way to me, Across to that strange country, the Beyond; And yet, not strange, for it has grown to be The home of those of whom I am so fond; They make it seem familiar and most dear, As journeying friends bring distant countries near. 
 And so for me there is no sting to death, And so the grave has lost its victory; It is but crossing with bated breath And white, set face, a little strip of sea, To find the loved ones waiting on the shore, More beautiful, more precious than before.  
   We miss her here, but she surely waits for Mike. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in this season of fall, the view from our window on the world transforms. As the stoic Greek philosopher Heraclitus has been quoted as saying, ``Nothing endures but change.'' 
   Since I became a Senator in 1959, I have observed that every 2 years the picture of the United States Senate also changes. This year will be no exception. Before we adjourn, we will wish a fond farewell to the men who have chosen to leave the hallowed halls of the Capitol to travel down new roads that will bring different vistas into view. 
   Five of our fellow Senators know, even before the election results are tallied in November, that come January 2001--the beginning of the 21st century and the beginning of the third millennium--they will be starting out on a new journey. One of these five has announced that he will take a position that will allow him to continue his advocacy for a fine and noble pursuit, the pursuit of education. In January, Senator BOB KERREY, the Senior Senator from Nebraska, but the youngest Senator who has announced his retirement from the Senate this session, will begin a new life, far from his native Omaha, as president of the New School University of New York City. There he certainly will have a different view from his window on the world, a much different view than the one we see from Capitol Hill. 
   While many of us were surprised by Senator KERREY's decision not to seek reelection at the youthful age of 57  years, setting off on new adventures is nothing new to Senator KERREY, who has already followed many different paths during his lifetime. While serving in the Senate, BOB KERREY has never feared to take the path less trodden, to follow his convictions and his principles no matter how rocky or lonely the road. His independence of thought and action is legendary. 
   After earning a Master of Science degree in pharmacy in 1966 from the University of Nebraska, he volunteered for military service in Vietnam. Not only did he volunteer to bear arms for our Nation, he distinguished himself during service. He earned a Bronze Star, a Purple Heart, and as a U.S. Navy SEAL. In doing so, BOB KERREY displayed such courage, dedication, and heroism that he was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Nixon. 
   In March 1999, on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the events giving rise to his receiving the Medal of Honor, I joined with my colleagues in the Senate to salute him for his courage, his determination, and his heroism. His heroic story is inspiring. 
   After Senator KERREY's return from service as a U.S. Navy SEAL, he started a chain of restaurants and health clubs in his home State of Nebraska. Then, in 1982, he ran for Governor of Nebraska and won. He served as Governor of Nebraska until 1986, when he announced, to the surprise of many, that despite a 70-percent approval rating, he would not seek another term as Governor. He was prepared to take a turn down a different road, and 2 years later, he won a seat in the United States Senate. 
   When his face was added to the Senate picture in 1989, he became a member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations. It was my pleasure to welcome him, as I was chairman of that committee at that time. I appreciated the clear vision and the unflappable demeanor that Senator KERREY brought to the committee. In 1997, he chose to leave the Appropriations Committee for the Senate Committee on Finance. The countenance of that important committee will drastically change when we return, God willing, in January, after Senators MOYNIHAN, BRYAN, KERREY, and MACK depart from the Senate, of their own volition and on their own choice. 
   I commend Senator KERREY for his willingness to work hard on issues of interest to him and to his constituents. 
   During his 57 years of life, he has thus far been a scholar, a U.S. Navy SEAL, a Medal of Honor recipient, a scholar, a restauranteur, a fitness club founder, Governor of Nebraska, and a United States Senator. He has made his life unique. I wish the Senator from Nebraska well as he sets off down the path for his next adventure. Knowing Senator KERREY's propensity for taking his own road, I shall close with the following lines of verse written by Robert Frost. We are all familiar with that great poem, ``The Road Not Taken.'' 
   The Road Not Taken Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same, And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back. I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-- I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, once again a critical region of the Middle East is engaged in violent clashes. Over the last week, the death toll in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank has risen to 67 lives lost. I know that Prime Minister Ehud Barak and PLO Leader Yasser Arafat made heroic efforts to try to reach a peace agreement these last few months. They even met for part of the time in my own State of West Virginia. With U.S. support and encouragement, the Israelis and Palestinians stood at the brink of a resolution, and they were as close as they have ever been to resolving a very longstanding dispute in that ancient, volatile, and embattled part of our world. Though I hope these two peoples will return to the negotiating table, today that opportunity appears lost. 
   This disheartening incident again illustrates that the Middle East peace is very fragile and could erupt like flash powder. While Saddam Hussein has been quelled for the time being, the world must always be on the watch. We do not know if the Israelis and Palestinians will reach a peace accord. Americans are affected in many ways. We have security and family interests in this region of the world, and the United States gets much of its energy resources from there as well. The U.S., our European allies, and many other industrial countries are tethered to the Middle Eastern oil chain. If we are ever going to break that stranglehold, then it is time that we take action here at home. 
   Over the past 18 months, the national average price of gasoline has risen from under $1 per gallon to $1.52 per gallon this week. As winter approaches and crude oil inventories remain at record low levels, both gasoline and fuel prices are expected to increase further. Americans are growing increasingly concerned about the seemingly endless volatility in our energy markets. 
   What we are seeing, Mr. President, in the fluctuation of energy prices is a textbook study of how supply and demand can affect energy prices. First, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed last year to reduce crude oil production, thus increasing the cost of producing gasoline. Secondly, gasoline refineries, which had shut down some operations when crude oil prices fell to record lows in 1998, suddenly faced shortages of production capacity to produce gasoline and heating oil when demand spiked earlier this year. 
   In response, the administration has successfully lobbied for an increase by OPEC in crude oil production over the past year. In March, OPEC's decision to increase crude oil production temporarily reduced the cost of gasoline, but prices increased again going into the summer driving season as demand for gasoline increased. Gasoline prices decreased in late summer, but, as winter approaches and the expected demand for crude oil, heating oil, and gasoline increases, prices could very likely climb again. These are the ups and downs of the energy roller coaster that has taken the American public for a ride. 
   To make matters worse, this volatility in gasoline prices is occurring as the United States prepares itself for the upcoming Presidential election. This has added fuel to the fire as Members of Congress, the administration, and politicians everywhere position themselves politically to avoid blame for the spike in energy prices. Unfortunately, such positioning is usually accompanied by a myriad of snake-oil remedies and miracle cures that do little more than lull the American public into believing that the problem is being fixed when, in fact, the problem is being exacerbated. 
   Two weeks ago, the administration announced such a proposal, against the better judgment of the U.S. Treasury Secretary and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, that would authorize the sale of 30 million barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve over the next month. This is the same petroleum reserve that was created in response to the 1973 Arab oil embargo to store oil in case of a national emergency, such as a war in the Middle East. Like the Army, you hope never to use the reserve. But, if you need to, it should be big enough to do the job. 
   Yet, the release of oil from this reserve is unlikely to have a significant effect on prices at the pump. The United States consumes approximately 19 million to 20 million barrels of crude oil per day. The administration's proposal would provide for an additional one million barrels per day. Such a small amount of oil is unlikely to have much of an effect on gasoline prices, especially in light of the additional 800,000 barrels per day of crude oil that will be produced by OPEC. 
   But what is worse is that this sort of intervention in the domestic energy market, which may seem simple, could actually be self defeating. If refiners expect more oil to be released from the reserve, these shrewd businessmen may  hold off on buying more crude oil to produce gasoline and heating oil until the price of crude oil decreases, which would make it more profitable to them, not to mention the oil companies that have posted strong profits this year. Similarly, OPEC could easily offset any benefits from the release of crude oil from the reserve by reducing its own production by an equal amount. 
   So, I am not sure that Americans should breathe a collective sigh of relief at this announcement regarding releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
   It might be good public relations but not a good faith effort to reduce prices. A similar ``fix all, miracle cure'' was offered this spring in response to high oil prices. Some Members of Congress proposed reducing the federal excise tax on gasoline in order to reduce prices at the pump. In their rush to score political points, the proposal was brought to the Senate floor for a vote twice in April--once as an amendment to the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution and again as a freestanding bill. Both times, a sensible majority in the Senate voted not to repeal the gasoline tax by substantial majorities. I am proud that so many of my colleagues refused to swallow this patent nostrum, realizing that first, the savings from the excise tax repeal would not filter down to the consumer, and, second, that a reduction in the excise tax would have a significantly negative effect on the highway trust fund. Presumably, the sponsors of this dangerous proposition were going to provide tax relief to these oil and gas companies and delay highway projects just to make a political point. It is time to get beyond this campaign hysteria and last-minute gimmickery. These current concerns are really just symptoms of a larger problem. 
   Mr. President, I would also be remiss if I did not raise disturbing evidence that oil companies are sending our own oil overseas. On average, 50,000 to 90,000 barrels of oil per day have been exported to the Asian Pacific Region from Alaska's Northern Slope after an export ban was lifted in 1995. This output equaled about 27 million barrels in 1999. Why are we exporting oil from Alaska to countries like South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and China when we face shortages at home? Are the same voices advocating for increased production in Alaska also supporting the export of oil overseas while simultaneously criticizing the recent release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve? These voices are singing the siren song for increased oil company profits, not the hallelujah chorus of relief for the average American. 
   So here we are today caught in a black hole that will do little to move us down the road toward developing a sustainable energy policy. Just last week, a motion was made to proceed to S. 2557. I believe that we should be deliberating proposals on energy security. I also believe that we should not forget that there are other measures out there that should be given equal attention. While this bill may have some valid energy policy provisions, so do many other proposals. I note for the record, that Senator DASCHLE began an effort over two years ago to construct an energy security package. This effort, which I have cosponsored, addresses a number of important energy resources and industries. If Senators wish to support greater energy independence and encourage cleaner, more efficient technologies, then I urge them to also look at S. 2904, the Energy Security Tax and Policy Act of 2000. 
   We need to be talking about very complicated and critical energy matters, asking what role and responsibility we all must play. What is OPEC doing? What are the oil and gas companies doing? What is the administration doing? What is Congress doing? What are we doing individually? 
   My call for a comprehensive national energy policy is longstanding. On May 14, 1984, I took to the Floor with a warning that America should not be so dependent on Persian Gulf oil. At that time, the Reagan Administration was trying to eliminate the Department of Energy and its many energy programs. I argued that this was a wrongheaded approach and that short-term budget concerns should not dominate longer-term national security interests. At that time, I said: ``Our energy security rests upon our military might, not upon our natural resources, nor our technological genius.'' 
   In another floor statement from August 6, 1987, I noted how the Reagan administration was continuing to undercut funding for the fossil, renewable, and synthetic fuels programs. That administration had slashed spending for energy conservation programs and vetoed legislation to provide for emergency preparedness and national appliance efficiency standards. Additionally, the Reagan administration was even balking at filling--not using--but filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. In reviewing that August 1987 speech, I warned:  
   Why must the energy security of the United States be protected first with guns and not with brains or our homegrown natural resources? . . . The Reagan Administration's destruction of the Nation's long-term energy policies--policies that have been developed and promoted by every Administration since President Nixon--is imperiling America's energy security.  
   What can Congress do to find some common ground? Energy security and energy independence are a critical national, in fact, a critical international issue. Congress should find beneficial proposals and move forward on passing legislation in the 107th Congress that will get the job done. We should be looking at a variety of opportunities. 
   Let me offer one example from the recent past. Several weeks ago, while the Senate was debating the bill to grant China permanent normal trade relations, I offered an amendment to increase the use of American-made clean energy technologies in China. No Senator argued against this amendment on its merits. I believe that if a proposal like this were offered on another bill, then it could very likely have passed by an overwhelming margin and would be a win-win-win opportunity for business, labor, and the environment. I say to my colleagues, knowing that a multi-trillion dollar clean energy and environmental infrastructure market will be exploding in the coming decades, we should be taking every opportunity to promote market-based initiatives to deploy these American-made clean energy technologies at home and export these same technologies to developing countries as soon as possible. 
   Still, I realize that an effective energy strategy will require much debate and a good bit of negotiation. This is not something that can be resolved by depending on any one approach, technology, or resource. There are many serious questions that must be examined when considering our energy choices. We must consider the pros and cons of each of our energy resources and ask the following questions. With regard to oil and natural gas, how can the U.S. decrease its dependence on foreign producers by increasing domestic production while also ensuring that environmental protection and conservation are promoted? Regarding nuclear energy, is it possible for the U.S. to continue utilizing our existing nuclear energy facilities while also finding a workable solution to the problem of nuclear waste? Can the U.S. find ways to decrease the price for renewable technologies like wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass in a very competitive energy market? Is it possible to reconcile the conflicts regarding hydroelectric power and sustainable fisheries? How can the U.S. continue to use coal while ensuring that the air and water are made even cleaner? Finally, how can American businesses and individuals use all of these energy resources more wisely and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions? No one industry, no one resource, no one technology, no one approach is going to provide that one silver bullet to fix our energy security problems! 
   Our long-term energy security interest goes far beyond the current price hikes in gasoline, diesel, home heating oil, or electricity. I fear that, as a nation, we are falling asleep at the wheel. We need policies that buffer our economy and our people from decisions made by foreign suppliers. 
   It is time to focus on increased research and development into advanced technologies, energy efficiency and conservation measures, and market-based incentives to rapidly move these advanced technologies and conservation measures from the lab to the field. I believe that a comprehensive national energy strategy can do all of this and incorporate a strong environmental strategy as well. 
   Therefore, what would a comprehensive national energy strategy include?  Let me suggest a framework that I believe would help Congress craft such an energy policy. We must look at developing all of our energy resource sectors--fossil, nuclear, and renewables. A comprehensive plan must include improved measures for all of the major energy consuming sectors--the transportation, manufacturing, residential, and commercial sectors. A national energy plan needs to address the development and the conservation of our resources. It does no good to be producing more of our energy at home if we are not making further progress to conserve energy as well, especially in a growing economy. We need to develop an effective pipeline for the development of more advanced energy technologies. This will demand that more money and effort must be devoted to research and development, demonstration, and, ultimately, deployment in the market place. This energy strategy must be sound economically and environmentally. We must examine actions that can be taken now as well as actions for the long-term. Finally, while taking these steps domestically, we should also be finding ways that we can increase the export of American-made clean energy technologies to other countries that need these technologies just as much as we do. 
   As many of my colleagues know, I have been working for many years to provide funding for a range of clean energy technologies. I note that two of these 21st century clean energy technologies, the Clean Coal and fuel cell programs, are being centered at our nation's newest national laboratory, the National Energy Technology Laboratory in Morgantown, WV and Pittsburgh, PA and I believe that Congress should continue to support critical efforts like these in the future. 
   These are 21st century clean energy technologies--not because this is the 21st century, it is not, until next year. But we are talking about technologies that extend into the future. 
   These technologies are essential for growing our economy while also ensuring that environmental improvements, energy security, public health, and air and water quality are met. I have been working for 15 years on the Clean Coal Technology Program, and I believe that it is possible to bring together several complementary and mutually beneficial proposals. Let me outline a framework for coal and Clean Coal Technologies that I believe should be included in an energy security bill in the 107th Congress. This package must be bipartisan, and I look forward to working with my Democratic and Republican colleagues who have supported this effort like Senator DASCHLE, Senator MCCONNELL, and others. 
   Senator LOTT's bill, S. 2557, has requested a report from the Department of Energy regarding coal and the development of an effective research, development, and demonstration program. I agree it is time to do a more comprehensive study of Clean Coal Technologies. Among other steps, the Department of Energy should work with the private sector on a study to find ways for achieving higher performance goals and should recommend a road map for the development of these new technologies. The Congress should also consider authorizing additional funding to carry out a more advanced research, development, and demonstration program to achieve these ends. I will certainly put my shoulder to the appropriations wheel in an effort to assist in this regard. 
   A comprehensive energy package should also include a provision to promote the commercialization of Clean Coal Technologies, similar to that included in S. 2904. This provision, which I and other Senators support, would help to establish incentives to increase the deployment of these advanced Clean Coal Technologies now and in the future. 
   Finally, it is time that the U.S. turn its attention to the current fleet of coal-fired power plants. These coal-fired powerplants generate approximately 56 percent of our Nation's electricity and are the work horses of our electric generating capacity. 
   Up here is part of the work. Take a look at the lights in the ceiling. When the curtains of night fall, look at the lights at the top of the Capitol and across both sides of the Capitol, and pause to think that those lights are burning because coal is still being mined. 
   It is time that we examine market-based incentives to make emission reductions and efficiency improvements for the existing fleet of coal-fired electric power generation. 
   I believe that Americans witnessed a healthy discussion about our Nation's energy security at Tuesday night's presidential debate between Vice President GORE and Governor Bush. Both candidates put forward their views on how the U.S. can effectively develop a comprehensive national energy policy. Each candidate made what I believe signify complementary goals regarding a comprehensive energy policy. Principally, Governor Bush expressed his belief that the U.S. should take additional steps to increase the availability of our domestic energy resources, and Vice President GORE asserted that the U.S. should also find ways to decrease our energy consumption. Additionally, and particularly, I welcome the comments by both Presidential candidates regarding clean coal technologies. 
   I have to say that this present administration and some of the budgets that have come to the Hill have sought to defer funding on clean coal technology, and even this year sought to rescind some of the money. That is going in the wrong direction. 
   The Vice President, in his September 14, 2000, letter to United Mine Workers President Cecil Roberts remarked, ``I strongly support accelerating the development and deployment of technologies that will allow us to use coal in cleaner and more efficient ways.'' Following his announced support for clean coal technologies at a campaign stop in Huntington, WV a day before, Governor Bush also voiced his support at the debate by saying, ``I want to develop the coal resources in America and have clean coal technologies.'' Responding to those comments by Governor Bush, Vice President GORE said, ``I strongly support new investments in clean coal technology.'' I am heartened by the comments of both candidates, and I hope that the next administration will be a strong advocate for the increased research and development, demonstration, and deployment of these clean coal technologies in the coming years. The next administration has an obligation to follow through on those commitments to help America's coal miners, develop our own resources and technologies, and to deploy these clean coal technologies in the market at home and abroad. If we want to have a national energy strategy, then we must sit down together and put all of our interests on the table. 
   I heard a great deal of talk by both Presidential candidates in that debate about what each is going to do. Each is going to do this and each is going to do that, and this is going to happen and that is going to happen. Very little mention was made in that debate about Congress. 
   Congress has to be a partner in carrying out whatever plans the winning candidate may have in this respect and in other respects. So don't leave out Congress, my friends. Congress is very much a partner. I hope both candidates will recognize that in their future debates. They will think of Congress because it takes help from Congress, because Congress is made up of the elected representatives of the people. You have to have Congress on your side, whoever becomes President. We will sit down together and put all of our interests on the table. 
   We should judge the success of our energy strategy by how it affects the average person. How will it benefit farmers, coal miners, home owners, and truck drivers? We need to help create more jobs and an even stronger economy and ensure that the U.S. does not quiver each time that OPEC tries to flex its muscles. We must not allow ourselves to be swayed by the winds of the current political movement. The American people are not fools. They realize that last-minute, short-term, quick-fix solutions do little to address the underlying problem: the need for comprehensive national energy policy. It is my hope that Congress will begin to take a serious look at energy security legislation in the 107th Congress. Mr. President, I stand ready to meet these challenges.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Florida, CONNIE  MACK, has decided to retire from the Senate after serving two successful terms. This Senator from the Sunshine State has served his people and his country well. 
   Following graduation from the University of Florida with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Marketing, the young Senator-to-be began a successful sixteen-year career as a community banker. Quickly emerging as a local civic leader in Cape Coral, FL, he fought to ensure access to vital health care services in his community by leading the effort to build a local hospital. 
   Heeding the call of greater professional challenge, CONNIE MACK entered the political arena when he won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982, a position he would occupy for the next six years. As a member of the House, he was recognized by U.S. News and World Report as one of the Nation's most effective ``rising political stars.'' His sincere dedication to public service and love for the art and the process of legislating further propelled him to seek and win a seat in the United States Senate. 
   It is obvious that his Florida constituents understand and appreciate the degree of skill, dedication, and integrity that Senator MACK has brought to his work. And, as Republican Conference Chairman and third-ranking member of the Senate Republican leadership, it is obvious that his Republican colleagues have understood and valued those qualities in Senator MACK as well. 
   In 1994, Senator MACK had the distinguished honor of being the first Republican in Florida history to be reelected to the U.S. Senate. He received 70 percent of the vote, more than any other Republican Senate candidate in the nation. In that same year, Senator MACK was named by Campaigns and Elections magazine as one of the 20 most popular elected officials in America. 
   Mr. President, no Senator has fought more vigorously to protect and preserve the jewel-green waters, the soft, white beaches, and the inland springs that comprise the immense natural beauty of the marvelous peninsula he so effectively represents. He has been an ardent supporter of restoring the natural history and the fragile ecosystem of the Florida Everglades, a true national treasure. Most recently, Senator MACK played a large role in the recent Senate passage of the largest environmental restoration project in history--a $7.8 billion effort to rescue the Florida Everglades from years of environmental degradation. 
   Senator MACK has been driven by his personal commitment to doing all that he can to provide a better, healthier life for all Americans and people of the world. He has worked long hours, and with great determination, in an effort to see that Federal dollars are wisely used to combat breast cancer, prostate cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease. The junior Senator from Florida has long realized the importance of providing researchers with the tools necessary to continue the tremendous advances being made in biomedical research. 
   In the Senate, CONNIE MACK has been a true champion of the fight against cancer. He impressively co-chairs the Senate Cancer Coalition with Senator DIANE FEINSTEIN to heighten awareness of cancer research, early detection programs, improving cancer prevention, and exploring various innovative cancer treatment options. Senator MACK and his wife Priscilla, have both escaped the clutches of cancer, and have led the charge to ensure that all Americans take to heart the message that early detection of cancer saves lives. The Senator and his wife have received numerous honors and awards in their crusade against cancer, such as the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship Ribbon of Hope Award in 1998 and the National Coalition for Cancer Research Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999. 
   Drawing upon his experience as a community banker, Senator MACK played a key role in defining the framework of landmark legislation in the Senate to modernize our nation's banking laws and offer more convenience for consumers. I supported this legislation. It has helped to shape the financial industry, enabling more efficient and appropriate responses to the burgeoning demands of an aggressive global marketplace. 
   And so, Mr. President, as he prepares to leave the Senate, I offer my sincere gratitude to Senator CONNIE MACK for his professionalism, for his friendship, for his leadership, for his candor, and for his many years of dedicated service to our nation. 
   Always a gentleman, and that means a lot in this body and in life, he brought to this Senate floor and to his committee work some of the best that Florida has to offer this Nation--a willingness to work hard, to make tough and principled decisions, and to seek common ground in order to serve the common good. It is these notable qualities which will be so sorely missed. 
   I wish my distinguished colleague from the Sunshine State well. 
   Next week I will have something to say about other colleagues who are retiring and about whom I have yet to state a farewell message. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in the short time available before the Senate votes on final passage of the Interior appropriations conference report, I want to again urge my colleagues to support this measure. It is a good compromise that balances the needs of our parks, our forests, our wildlife refuges, and our trust responsibilities to American Indians, against the resources made available to us. That task--the task of reconciling identified needs with limited resources--is not easy. 
   I am particularly pleased with the level of funding in this bill for fossil energy research. The new power plant improvement initiative, along with the other fossil energy research programs in the Department of Energy, are critical to this nation's energy security. Working to curtail our reliance on imported oil, and ensuring that our current fleet of power plants are efficient and environmentally sound, should be the cornerstone of the next administration's energy policy. I can assure the next president, whomever he may be, that I, for one, am ready to assist in that endeavor. 
   Mr. President, I also wish to take a moment to thank the chairman of the full committee, Senator TED STEVENS, for his interest in this bill, for his continued support, and for his willingness to work with Senator GORTON and me to ensure that we were able to get to this point. In particular, I am grateful for his help in making additional resources available to the Interior subcommittee. Without those resources, we could not have crafted this bill. 
   Finally, Mr. President, let me again thank my colleague, the subcommittee chairman, Senator GORTON. He and his staff have truly been a pleasure to work with. 
   When I talk of staff, let me briefly mention my own staff person, Peter Kiefhaber. I believe this is his first bill, first major bill, to assist me on this  floor throughout the markup, throughout the hearings. He has done a masterful job as a new person in that position. I thank him and I congratulate him. 
   I yield the floor now. I yield my remaining time to Senator GORTON. 
   I, again, thank the distinguished Senator for yielding when he had the floor, to allow me to make this brief statement.

   Mr. BYRD. It goes without saying, Mr. President--I have said it many times already--that the chairman of this subcommittee is fully knowledgeable of the contents of the original bill, fully knowledgeable of what is in this conference report, and always--always considerate, always courteous, and is one of the finest chairmen I have ever served with on any subcommittee. And I served with a lot of chairmen of subcommittees. This one is almost without a flaw when it comes to being chairman of this subcommittee. 
   It is a pleasure for me to serve with him. I would like to be chairman one day, but I am not the chairman, and I fully understand that. If somebody else other than I has to be chairman, I like Senator GORTON. We accomplish a lot for this Nation together. This is a great subcommittee. 
   I have said many times it really is a western subcommittee, more so than it is eastern, as far as I am concerned. I have said that over the years. But we do our best because somebody has to do the work. I do enjoy it. I enjoy the collaboration we always have in connection with this bill. I do it understanding that the appropriations process is absolutely vital to the operation of Government and that we need to know about that process. We need to always understand the rules and the precedents of Government. 
   If I had a larger vocabulary, I could say more about the chairmanship that  is rendered by Mr. GORTON. I will not speak further. I could say the same thing with regard to the chairman of the full committee, TED STEVENS. There could not be any finer man. He is always a gentleman. That goes a long way with me around the Senate. He is always a gentleman. He is always considerate of the needs and the problems of the constituents of other Senators. He listens courteously, and he is very straightforward. If he cannot do it, he will tell you so. He tells me that. If he cannot do it, he will tell me so. I like that kind of talk. 
   Mr. President, I fully support the legislation. I urge my colleagues to support it as well. 
   I will not reiterate the inventory of programs contained in the Interior conference report, nor their respective funding levels. The chairman has done an excellent job of providing Members with those details. I do, however, wish to point out a new program planned for the Department of Energy because of its significance to this nation's overall energy security. 
   Within the Fossil Energy Research and Development account, funds have been provided to undertake a power plant improvement initiative. This new effort is vital to our Nation if we hope to continue our economic expansion. Upgrading and renewing our out-of-date and undersized electric power system cannot wait. We cannot sit back and wait for the development of new power sources which, to date, have not proved commercially viable. 
   The fact is, more than half of this Nation's electricity is generated in coal-fired power plants, a situation that is not likely to change for the foreseeable future. 
   We are working today by virtue of the lights that are in the ceiling of this Chamber. It used to be in this country that this Chamber was lighted by gas. It was only in this century, the 20th century--and we are not into the 21st yet--it was only in this century that we saw air-conditioning come to this Chamber. 
   From where does this energy come? What is the source? What is the source of the little light we see at night burning in the top of the Washington Monument? 
   I made a trip around the world with a House committee in 1955, 45 years ago. We went around the world in an old Constellation, four propellers. We visited many countries. Today it would be called a junket. But we were away 68 days. We visited many countries throughout the world. When I was in high school, I read a book by Jules Verne titled ``Around the World in 80 Days.'' We went around the world in 68 days. Of course, John Glenn went around the world in, I believe it was 81 minutes. 
   The point I am making is I visited many countries, saw many things, met many high people--kings and princes and queens, shahs. We saw wonderful edifices, beautiful edifices, great edifices, such as the Taj Mahal. But the most enjoyable, pleasurable, satisfying, and comforting thing I saw on that whole trip was when we flew back into Washington and I saw those two or three little red lights in the top of the Washington Monument. There we were, home again, where we could go to the water faucet and drink without fear that we might succumb to some disease. Having been in Afghanistan on that trip and Jakarta and India, Pakistan, Korea, and Malaysia--all of these places where one certainly must not, at that time, drink the water without its being boiled--it brought to me in a very vivid way what a wonderful country we have and how great it is to be home, back in the good old United States of America, where we take so many things for granted. 
   There were those lights in the top of the Washington Monument, and here are these lights. Take away coal; take away those lights. The great eastern cities of New York and Philadelphia and Boston, the great cities of the East--take away the coal, and it is going to shut down a lot of industries. People will then begin to appreciate that coal miner whose sweat, and sometimes tears, and sometimes blood afford this great country the leisure and the comfort that come from coal-fired plants. 
   We are working to make this coal more environmentally feasible. We have gone a long way. I have supported appropriations and initiated appropriations for clean coal technology, and we have seen the results of this research that is being done by these funds that come out of the committee on which the distinguished minority whip, Mr. REID, and I sit. 
   There are people in this Government who, I imagine, would like to see the mines closed, coal mining done away with; shut them down. We know we are in transition, and we are preparing for that eventuality by the fact that we appropriate funds in this committee to produce energy in an environmentally feasible manner.

   Mr. BYRD. Yes. I thank my friend for his excellent contribution to the colloquy. 
   Many times, as he has said, we have discussed this matter. He understands the background from which I came--which is a similar background to that from which he came--the coal mining; in his case, gold mining; in my case, coal mining. Sometimes we refer to it as ``black gold.'' 
   This coal has provided the livelihood for thousands of miners over the years, who have risked their lives to go into those coal mines. So research, I have believed during the years I have been on the Senate Appropriations Committee--42 years--is the answer to many of the things, research. And through research, mining has been made more safe. We have fewer and fewer miners being killed annually than we have had in the past. 
   It has been a very bloody--a very bloody--employment and a very bloody industry, if you go back over the years. So we have improved the safety. We are helping to clean up the environment. We are understanding ways in which coal may be mined more cheaply. And that is the result of the moneys that have been appropriated through this Subcommittee on Interior. 
   As I have already indicated, I have appropriated, I have been the source of the appropriations of millions of dollars for clean coal technology. And I have to say that my own administration has several times, in the budget that has been sent up here to the Congress, recommended deferring--deferring--some of these moneys, using these moneys that are there for clean coal technology, using them for something else, or even rescinding some of those moneys. 
   Now I have fought--fought--these budget recommendations off several times. So I think we have reached the point where the Presidential candidates need to talk about this. And I hope they will. 
   Given that reality, it makes good, common sense for the United States to  try to ease the demand on the existing fleet of electric plants. And, so, the conferees have included this new power plant improvement initiative in an effort to bring business and Government together in a productive partnership that will produce more energy, yet cleaner energy. I am pleased that this effort is being made, and I thank the distinguished chairman for his help in ensuring that our Nation's energy needs continue to be a top priority. 
   I thank the other members of the Appropriations Committee. And I thank our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol on the Appropriations Committee there who have worked with us in this regard. 
   Beyond this particular program, let me also say how much I appreciate the chairman's overall support for projects and programs of importance to the minority Members of this body. I have already referred to that, but I think it bears reflecting upon again. As always, his graciousness, his dedication to duty, and his steadfast commitment to working in a bipartisan manner have made this conference far less arduous than it might otherwise have been. Despite all the tangents that conferees are wont to go off on--if left to their own devices; and I understand how that is very easily done--Senator GORTON never lost sight of the ultimate task at hand. 
   So in my opinion, based on my experience, he is the consummate professional. And he and his staff--we must not forget the staff. We often hear that the clothes make the man. Well, I must say, based on my experience here, that the staff, in large measure, make the Senator and help to turn the wheels of the Nation. So our staffs are to be commended for their efforts. 
   I urge all my colleagues, Mr. President, to support this conference report so that we can send it to the White House for the President's signature. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on a cold winter afternoon in 1941, a young boy of fourteen went about his daily business, engaged in his humble profession. I can imagine that to many of the pedestrians who made their way down Central Park West that day, this youngster perhaps was nothing extraordinary, just another shoeshine boy. However, this was not just another winter day; it was December 7, 1941. It marked the beginning of America's active participation in the greatest struggle of the twentieth century, a war that would take this boy and make him a man. And it was, perhaps, the last time Daniel Patrick Moynihan was left standing on the sidelines as the controversies and events that would affect our Nation unfolded. So this was not just another boy. Today, I honor this man and commemorate his transformation from a humble shoe-shine boy to the senior Senator from the State of New York. It is with a heavy heart, a heart that is filled with admiration, that I bid Senator MOYNIHAN farewell and thank him for his ceaseless efforts on behalf of the people of New York and this Nation. 
   He will not be leaving this afternoon or tomorrow or the next day, but this is his final year, by his own choice, in which he will serve the Nation and his State of New York from his position in this Chamber. 
   Raised by a journalist and a bar-keep in Manhattan's melting pot, Senator  MOYNIHAN climbed the ladder of academia with the callused hands of a blue-collar day laborer to become a man of accomplishment and great learning, the embodiment of the American Dream. He once arrived for an examination at City College of New York with a dockworker's loading hook tucked into his back pocket next to his pencils, as if it were a study in contrasting worlds. 
   It was this unrelenting desire, this hunger, this thirst for knowledge that led this former shoeshine boy from the sidewalks of New York, that led this longshoreman who had worked out in the cold with the swirling snow and the wintry winds about him, to his improbable destiny in the life of our Nation. 
   Having served honorably in the U.S. Navy during World War II as a gunnery officer aboard the U.S.S. Quirinus, he earned a doctorate from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in 1961. He taught briefly at both Harvard University and Tufts University and then worked in a series of high positions in the Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and Ford administrations. Now get that, high positions in four administrations--the Kennedy, the Johnson, the Nixon, and the Ford administrations. He became the first and only man ever to serve in the Cabinets or subcabinets of four successive Presidents. 
   What an outstanding career. What an outstanding man for that career. However, this was only the beginning, for this great thinker among politicians. He was also to become one of the finest politicians among thinkers. 
   A true visionary, Senator MOYNIHAN is the kind of philosopher-politician who the Founding Fathers had fervently hoped would populate the Senate. Men, who, like Socrates' philosopher-kings described in Plato's Republic, ``are awake rather than dreaming''--men who have broken the bonds of ignorance and have sought the truth of fine and just and good things, not simply the shapes and the half-defined shadows of the unthinking world; men who have shared the light of their learning, illuminating the path for others--some of whom always seem to be left in the dark. 
   If there is, in fact, one man among those of us in the Senate who truly epitomizes Socrates' philosopher-king, it is surely, indubitably, and without question, the senior Senator from the State of New York, Mr. MOYNIHAN. 
   With a pragmatic eye and a unique talent for seeing the issues that face our Nation on a larger scale--on a grand scale--Senator MOYNIHAN has spent most of his life breaking through the partisan politics inside this beltway. He possesses both a startling ability to foresee future problems, far beyond the ken of most men, and the courage to address these problems before they become apparent to common men. Issues that few others tackle with insight, such as Social Security, health care, and welfare reform, he has passionately addressed for many years--crossing party lines, challenging every administration--and all without personal concern for political backlash. Simply put, Senator MOYNIHAN states facts, the cold, 
   hard truths that many others in high places refuse to face and that some are unable to see. His conscience is his compass, and his heart is steadied by his unfaltering belief in the power of knowledge and the possibilities of government. 
   As Senator MOYNIHAN steps away from his desk on the Senate floor for the final time--he will never step away from it in my memory. I will always see him at that desk. I will always see his face--that unkempt hair, the bow tie, the spectacles which he frequently readjusts. I can hear him say: ``sir; sir.'' 
   As he steps away from his desk on the Senate floor for the final time, he will walk away with his head held high, with his legacy intact, and with a distinguished and singular place in our Nation's history well secured. He will always be looked to as a leader of men, as an author of many books--more books than most Senators have read--and as a compassionate intellectual who has no peer in this Senate, who has used his considerable talents to become one of the principal architects of our Nation's foreign policy and our Nation's social security safety net. He will be remembered thusly, for these and more. 
   U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations, author of the Welfare Reform Act of 1988 and the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, chairman of the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works from 1992 to 1993, chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance from 1993 to 1994, DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN has left his indelible mark on this country. 
   He served as the chairman of that Finance Committee, one of the oldest of the few committees that sprang into being early, I believe it was in 1816. It was from that Committee on Finance that the Appropriations Committee was carved in 1867, a half century later. In the beginning, the Finance Committee handled both the finance and the appropriations business of the Senate. The Finance Committee was well led when DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN sat in the chair. 
   I certainly will never forget the role that Senator MOYNIHAN played in our battle against the line-item veto. Like Socrates' quoting the shade of the dead Achilles in Homer's epic, the ``Odyssey,'' Senator MOYNIHAN would rather, `` `work the Earth as a serf to another, one without possessions,' and go through any sufferings, than share their opinions and live as they do.'' 
   Incapable of indifference and unable to sit by as others were paralyzed by ignorance, Senator MOYNIHAN rose up and fought the good fight--the just fight--and he won, sir. He won. 
   In the 24 years that Senator MOYNIHAN has walked the marble halls of the Capitol, he has graced us all with intellectual vigor and a stellar level of scholarship. He has helped us all to ascend the path of true knowledge and reach for wisdom. Each of us, Democrat and Republican alike, recognizes that when Senator MOYNIHAN speaks, we should listen for we may learn something that could fundamentally shift our thinking on a given matter. Senator MOYNIHAN has been a guiding light, a sage of sages, the best of colleagues, and always, always a gentleman--always a gentleman. 
   On this day, when I state this encomium in my feeble way--feeble because I cannot meet the challenge, strive though I must, I cannot meet the challenge to gropingly find the appropriate words to express my true and deep abiding admiration and love. I cannot find it for this man. 
   I have served with many men and women in this Senate. Everyone here knows of my great admiration for some of those men--I say ``men'' because, for the most part, of these more than two centuries, only men served in this body. Every colleague of mine knows of my deep admiration for certain former Senators--Senator Richard Russell, Senator Russell Long, Senator Lister Hill, Senator Everett Dirksen, and others--and yet Senator MOYNIHAN is uniquely unique. He is not the keeper of the rules as was Senator Russell. He is not the great orator that was Senator Dirksen, but this man is unique in his knowledge, in his grasp of great issues, in his ability to foresee the future and to point the way, always unassuming, always courteous, always a gentleman. Ah, that we could all be like this man! 
   I wish I could have been so fortunate as to sit in Senator MOYNIHAN's classes at Harvard or, to paraphrase Garfield, on a log in the West Virginia hills with Pat Moynihan on one end and me on the other. That is the picture I have of one to whom I look up, one whom I admire and at whose feet I would gladly sit to learn the lessons, the philosophy, the chemistry of the times. 
   Erma and I offer our best wishes to his lovely and gracious wife Elizabeth as our esteemed colleague, Senator MOYNIHAN, embarks on yet another adventure--retirement. I thank him for being this special man, always a philosopher-Senator. He will be sorely missed here. Whence cometh another like him? 
   Herman Melville, in his classic work, Moby Dick, said this:  
   There is a Catskill Eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces. And even if he forever flies within the gorge, that gorge is in the mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop, the Mountain Eagle is still higher than the other birds upon the plain, even though they soar.  
   Many who have passed through these halls have soared, but very, very few could ever truly be likened to a Catskill Eagle.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, recently, a great voice was silenced when Carl Thomas Rowan passed away. As a newspaper columnist, he articulated the problems and predicaments of working Americans. As a Presidential advisor, Mr. Rowan spoke for the rights not only of minorities but also for all Americans who were getting the short end of the stick, as we say back in the West Virginia hills. 
   Carl Rowan and I came from similar backgrounds. We both grew up in poor coal-mining communities and we never forgot our roots. Carl often talked about growing up without running water, without electricity, without those basic amenities that so many people take for granted today. As they did for me, those humble beginnings provided Carl Rowan with the burning desire to make a difference in his community and in his country. And make a difference he did. 
   The only thing stronger than Carl Rowan's voice was his conviction. He stood for basic principles--equality and freedom--and those principles guided him at every step in his life. Earlier this year, Carl Rowan wrote:  
   Men and women do not live only by what is attainable; they are driven more by what they dream of and aspire to that which might be forever beyond their grasp.  
   That ideal resonated not only in his columns but also in his life. Instead of simply bemoaning the fact that a college education was too expensive for many underprivileged children, Mr. Rowan in 1987 created the Project Excellence Foundation, which has made nearly $80 million available to students for academic scholarships. Instead of allowing the amputation of part of his right leg to slow him down, Mr. Rowan walked--and even danced; even danced--faster than doctors expected, and he then pushed for greater opportunities for the disabled. When others saw obstacles, Carl Rowan saw challenges. When others saw impossibilities, Carl Rowan saw opportunities. Instead of cursing the darkness, Carl Rowan lighted the candles. 
   Mr. Rowan wrote:  
   Wise people will remember that the Declaration of Independence and the Preamble to our Constitution are mostly unattainable wishful thinking or make-believe assertions that were horizons beyond the reality of life at the time they were written.  
   Carl Rowan always reached beyond the horizon--he always went beyond the horizon--and he helped others to aspire to do the same. With the passing of Carl Rowan, journalism has lost one of its best, the underprivileged have lost a friend, and the Nation has lost a part of its social conscience. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   October 2, 1999: 
   Dian Bailey, 29, Detroit, MI; 
   Charles L. Coron, 52, New Orleans, LA; 
   Joanel Facouloute, 46, Miami-Dade County, FL; 
   Filiberto Gamez, 21, Chicago, IL; 
   Lucretia Henderson, 13, Kansas City, MO; 
   Kenneth Holland, 39, Louisville, KY; 
   Leroy L. Lee, 31, Chicago, IL; 
   George Morris, 24, Washington, DC; 
   Hugo Najero, 15, San Antonio, TX; 
   Majid Radee, 30, Detroit, MI; 
   Edison Robinson, 25, Detroit, MI; 
   Harold Swan, 37, Louisville, KY; 
   Richard Thomas, 30, Philadelphia, PA; 
   Ruben Trevino, Jr., 46, Houston, TX; 
   Unidentified male, 17, Portland, OR. 
   One of the victims of gun violence I mentioned, 13-year-old Lucretia Henderson of Kansas City, Missouri, was shot and killed while riding in a car with her cousin and two friends. Lucretia was killed when her two friends in the backseat began playing with a handgun. 
   Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

   Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, to begin with, I should say that I intend to support the short-term continuing resolution. I think it is very important that we do so. But I have reserved this time for the purpose of expressing concerns about what is happening to the Senate and, in particular, what is happening to the appropriations process. Several of my colleagues will join me as we move through the morning and the afternoon. I shall do so without, of course, pointing my finger of criticism at any Senator, naming any Senator. I merely want to talk about what is happening to our Senate, its rules, its processes. And I intend to abide by the rules concerning debate. I say that at the start. 
   Mr. President, section 7, article I, of the U.S. Constitution, states: ``All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills.'' 
   Let me quote again the last portion of section 7, article I: ``but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills,'' meaning the Senate may propose or concur with amendments on any bill, whether it is a revenue bill or otherwise. When I say ``bills,'' I include, of course, resolutions. 
   Thus, Mr. President, the organic law of our Republic assures Senators--all Senators; Republicans and Democrats--the right to offer amendments, not only to bills for raising revenue, but also ``other bills.'' 
   The requirement that revenue bills shall originate in the House of Representatives grew out of the Great Compromise, which was entered into on July 16, 1787. It was this Great Compromise that provided for equality of the States in the Upper House, with each State, large or small, having two votes. And, but for which, the Constitutional Convention would have ended in failure, and instead of a United States of America, which we have today, we would have had, in all likelihood, a ``Balkanized States of America'' from sea to shining sea--from the Atlantic to the Pacific--from the Canadian border to the Gulf of Mexico. The small States at the Constitutional Convention were adamant in their demands for equal status with the large States in the Upper House, regardless of size or population, so that the small State of Rhode Island, for example, had an equal vote in the Senate with the large State of New York which was larger and with a greater population. All States are equal in this body. 
   When the large States yielded to the small States in this regard, the way was open and paved for eventual success in the attainment of the Constitution which was then sent to the States for ratification. 
   As a part of that compromise, the large States demanded that revenue bills originate in the House of Representatives.  
   Thus, the freedom to offer amendments in the Senate is assured by the Constitution of the United States. And what about the freedom to speak? What about the freedom to debate? Is that assured in the Senate? Yes. Section 6 of article I of the United States Constitution states:  
   And for any speech or debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other place.  
   So I cannot be questioned in any other place. James Madison, who was a Member of the other body could not be questioned in any other place. No Senator could be questioned in any other place. But what about the freedom to debate at length; in other words, what about a filibuster? Is there any limitation on debate in the Senate today? No, except when cloture is invoked, or when there are time limitations set by unanimous consent of all Senators. 
   Debate could be limited under rule 10 of the 1778 rules of the Continental Congress, by the adoption of the previous question. Likewise, when the Senate adopted its 1789 rules under the new Constitution, debate could be limited by invoking the previous question. However, in its first revision of the Senate rules in 1806, the Senate dropped the motion for the previous question. As a matter of fact, Aaron Burr, when he left the Vice Presidency in 1805, recommended that the previous question be dropped. Until 1917, when the first cloture rule was adopted, there was no limitation on debate in the Senate, unlike the House of Representatives, where the previous question can still be moved even today. 
   As we all know, of course, 60 votes are required in the Senate to invoke cloture and thus limit debate. The previous question not being included in the Senate rules, just what is the ``previous question''? Thomas Jefferson in his ``Manual'' explains it as follows: ``When any question is before the House, any member may move a previous question, `Whether that question (called the main question) shall now be put?' If it pass in the affirmative, then the main question is to be put immediately, and no man may speak anything further to it, either to add or alter ..... if the nays prevail, the main question shall not then be put.'' 
   Hence, the use of the motion to put the previous question is an effective way to end debate and vote immediately on the main question. 
   As the distinguished Presiding Officer knows--the Chair being occupied at the moment by the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, Mr. BUNNING--in the other body, the previous question can be used to end debate, if a majority of the Members there so desire. But that is not so in the Senate. It was so until 1806, but no more in the Senate. 
   Of the various legislative branches throughout the world today, only 60 are bicameral in nature, and of these 60 bicameral legislatures around the world, only the Upper Houses of the U.S. and Italy are not subordinated to the Lower House. Senators should understand what a privilege it is to serve in the U.S. Senate. The U.S. Senate is the premiere Upper Chamber in the world, two of the main reasons being that in the U.S. Senate there exists the right of unlimited debate and the right to offer amendments. 
   Another singular feature of the U.S. Senate is in the fact that it is the forum of the States. It is not just a forum; it is the forum of the States. The Senate, therefore, represents the ``Federal'' concept, while the House of Representatives, being based on population, represents the ``national'' concept in our constitutional system. In the very beginning, the Senate was seen as the bulwark of the State governments against despotic presidential power; it was the special defender of State sovereignty. It was meant to be and exists today as the special defender of State sovereignty. The Senate was also seen as a check against the ``radical'' tendencies which the House of Representatives might display. 
   I have been a Member of this body now for 42 years, and the longer I serve, the more convinced I am of the efficacy of the Senate rules as protectors of the Senate's right to unlimited debate and the Senate's right to amend. The Senate is not a second House of Representatives, nor is it an adjunct to the House of Representatives. It is a far different body from the House of Representatives. And it is a far different body by virtue of the Constitution and by virtue of Senate rules and precedents. The Constitution and the Senate rules have made the Senate a far different body from the House of Representatives. 
   Thomas Jefferson, in his Manual of Parliamentary Practice, emphasized the importance of adhering to the rules:  
   Mr. Onslow, the ablest among the Speakers of the House of Commons, used to say, ``It was a maxim he had often heard when he was a young man, from old and experienced Members, that nothing tended more to throw power into the hands of the Administration, and those who acted with a majority of the House of Commons, than a neglect of, or departure from, the rules of proceedings; that these forms, as instituted by our ancestors, operated as a check and control on the actions of the majority, and that they were, in many instances, a shelter and protection to the minority, against the attempts of power.'' So far, the maxim is certainly true--  
   Continued Mr. Onslow, speaking of the British House of Commons--  
   and is founded in good sense, as it is always in the power of the majority, by their number, to stop any improper measure proposed on the part of their opponents-- 
   The minority--  
   the only weapons by which the minority can defend themselves against similar attempts from those in power are the forms and rules of proceeding which have been adopted as they were found necessary, from time to time, and become the law of the House-- 
   He was talking about the law of the House of Commons--  
   by a strict adherence to which the weaker party-- 
   Meaning the minority--  
   can only be protected from those irregularities and abuses which these forms were intended to check, and which the wantonness of power is but too often apt to suggest to large and successful majorities.  
   Now there you have it from the mother country, from the House of Commons. So when we speak of rules, Mr. Onslow laid it out very clearly as to the supreme importance of the rules as protectors of a minority. 
   Jefferson went on to say:  
   And whether these forms be in all cases the most rational or not is really not of so great importance. It is much more material that there should be a rule to go by than what that rule is; that there may be a uniformity of proceeding in business not subject to the caprice of the Speaker--  
   Jefferson is talking about the Speaker of the House of Commons, and he is also referring to the Speaker in the House of Representatives.  
   --or capriciousness of the members.  
   Once more, this is Jefferson talking:  
   It is much more material that there should be a rule to go by than what that rule is; that there may be a uniformity of proceeding in business not subject to the caprice of the Speaker or capriciousness of the members. It is very material that order, decency, and regularity be preserved in a dignified public body.  
   Nothing could be more true than Jefferson's observations which I have read in part. 
   Now, Mr. President, my own experience with the Senate rules compels me to appreciate the wisdom that Vice President Adlai Stevenson expressed in his farewell address to the Senate on March 3, 1897. I believe his observation is as fitting today as 
   it was at the end of the 19th century. Let me say that again. I believe his observation is as fitting today, as we close the 20th century, as it was at the end of the 19th century. Here is what he said: 
   It must not be forgotten that the rules governing this body--  
   The Senate--  
   are founded deep in human experience; that they are the result of centuries of tireless effort in legislative halls, to conserve, to render stable and secure, the rights and liberties which have been achieved by conflict. By its rules, the Senate wisely fixes the limits to its own power. Of those who clamor against the Senate, and its methods of procedure, it may be truly said: ``They know not what they do.'' In this Chamber alone are preserved without restraint-- 
   This is Adlai Stevenson talking here--  
   two essentials of wise legislation and of good government: the right of amendment and of debate. Great evils often result from hasty legislation; rarely from the delay which follows full discussion and deliberation. In my humble judgment, the historic Senate--preserving the unrestricted right of amendment and of debate, maintaining intact the time-honored parliamentary methods and amenities which unfailingly secure action after deliberation--possesses in our scheme of government a value which cannot be measured by words.  
   How true. I hope that Senators will read again these words that were spoken by our ancestors concerning the  importance of the rules and precedents, the importance of amendments, the right to amend, and the importance of the freedom to debate at length. I hope Senators will read this. 
   We all know that the Senate is unique in its sharing of power with the President in the making of treaties, and in its confirmation powers with respect to nominations, as well as in its judicial function as the sole trier of impeachments brought by the House of Representatives. 
   The Senate is also unique in the quality that exists between and among states of unequal territorial size and population. But we must not forget that the right of extended, and even unlimited debate, together with the unfettered right to offer amendments, are the main cornerstones of the Senate's uniqueness. The right of extended debate is also a primary reason that the United States Senate is the most powerful Upper Chamber in the world today. 
   The occasional abuse of this right has a painful side effect, but it never has been--I am talking about the right to debate at length; I am talking about filibusters, if you please --never will be fatal to the overall public good in the long run. 
   The word ``filibuster'' has an unfortunate connotation. But there have been many useful filibusters during the existence of this Republic. I have engaged in some of them. There has not been a real, honest to goodness old-type filibuster in this Senate in years and years. 
   Without the right of unlimited debate, of course, there would be no filibusters, but there would also be no Senate, as we know it. The good outweighs the bad. Filibusters have proved to be a necessary evil, which must be tolerated lest the Senate lose its special strength and become a mere appendage of the House of Representatives. If this should happen, which God avert, the American Senate would cease to be ``that remarkable body'' about which William Ewart Gladstone spoke--``the most remarkable of all the inventions of modern politics.'' 
   Without the potential for filibusters, that power to check a Senate majority or an imperial presidency would be destroyed. 
   The right of unlimited debate is a power too sacred to be trifled with. Our English forebears knew it. They had been taught by sad experience the need for freedom of debate in their House of Commons. So they provided for freedom of debate in the English Bill of Rights in 1689. And our Bill of Rights, in many ways, has its roots deep in English parliamentary history. As Lyndon Baines Johnson said on March 9, 1949: ``..... If I should have the opportunity to send into the countries behind the iron curtain one freedom and only one, I know what my choice would be. ..... I would send to those nations the right of unlimited debate in their legislative chambers. ..... If we now, in haste and irritation, shut off this freedom, we shall be cutting off the most vital safeguard which minorities possess against the tyranny of momentary majorities.'' 
   I served with Lyndon Johnson in this Senate when he was the majority leader. We had some real filibusters in those days. I sat in that chair up there 22 hours on one occasion--22 hours in one sitting--almost a day and a night. So Lyndon Johnson was one who could speak with authority based on experience in that regard. 
   Arguments against filibusters have largely centered around the principle that the majority should rule in a democratic society. The very existence of the Senate, however, embodies an equally valid tenet in American democracy: the principle that minorities have rights. 
   I am not here today to advocate filibusters. I am talking about the freedom of debate--unlimited debate, if necessary. 
   Furthermore, a majority of Senators, at a given time and on a particular issue, may not truly represent majority sentiment in the country. Senators from a few of the more populous states may, in fact, represent a majority in the nation while numbering a minority of votes in the Senate, where all the states are equal. Additionally, a minority opinion in the country may become the majority view, once the people are more fully informed about an issue through lengthy debate and scrutiny. A minority today may become the majority tomorrow. 
   Take the Civil Rights Act of 1964, for example. From the day that Senator Mike Mansfield, then the majority leader, submitted the motion to proceed to the civil rights bill to the day that the final vote was cast on that bill, 103 calendar days had passed--103 days on one bill, the Civil Rights Act of 1964. That is almost as many days on one bill in 1964 as the Senate has been in session this whole year to date. 
   Mr. President, the Framers of the Constitution thought of the Senate as the safeguard against hasty and unwise action by the House of Representatives in response to temporary whims and storms of passion that may sweep over the land. Delay, deliberation, and debate--though time consuming--may avoid mistakes that would be regretted in the long run. 
   The Senate is the only forum in the government where the perfection of laws may be unhurried and where controversial decisions may be hammered out on the anvil of lengthy debate. The liberties of a free people will always be safe where a forum exists in which open and unlimited debate is allowed. It is not just for the convenience of Senators that there be a forum in which free and unlimited debate can be had. More importantly, the liberties of a free people will always be safe where a forum exists in which open and unlimited debate is allowed. That forum is here in this Chamber. 
   The most important argument supporting extended debate in the Senate, and even the right to filibuster, is the system of checks and balances. The Senate operates as the balance wheel in that system, because it provides the greatest check of all against an all-powerful executive through the privilege that Senators have to discuss without hindrance what they please for as long as they please. Senators ought to reflect on these things. There is nothing like history and the experience of history that can teach the lessons that we can learn from the past. A minority can often use publicity to focus popular opinion upon matters that can embarrass the majority and the executive. 
   Mr. President, we have reviewed briefly these facts about the U.S. Senate: (1) That it is a legislative body in which the smaller states, like the State of West Virginia, like the State of Kentucky, like the State of Rhode Island, the State of Wyoming, the State of Montana, regardless of territory or the size of population, are equal to the larger states in the union, with each state having two votes; (2) that it is a forum of the states and, from the beginning, was representative of the sovereignty of the individual states within the federal system; (3) that aside from its uniqueness with respect to treaties, nominations, and impeachment trials, the Senate is unique among the Upper Chambers of the world in that it is a forum in which amendments can be offered to bills and resolutions passed by the Lower House, and in which its members have a right to unlimited debate. The Senate has, therefore, been referred to as the greatest deliberative body in the world. Because of its members' rights to amend and to debate without limitation as to time, Woodrow Wilson referred to the Senate as the greatest Upper Chamber that exists. Because of its unique powers, the record is replete throughout the history of this republic with instances in which the Senate has demonstrated the wisdom of the Framers in making it the main balance wheel in our Constitutional system of separation of powers and checks and balances. It is a chamber in which bad legislation has been relegated to the dust bin, good legislation has originated, and the people of the country have been informed of the facts concerning the great issues of the day. Woodrow Wilson, himself, stated that the informing function of the legislative branch was as important if not more so than its legislative function. 
   It has checked the impulsiveness, at times, of the other body, and it has also been a check against an overweening executive. In the course of the 212 years since its beginning in March 1789, the Senate has, by and large, fulfilled the expectations of its Framers and proved itself to be the brightest spark of genius that emanated from the anvil of debate and controversy at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia during that hot summer of 1787. However, over the last  few years, however, I have viewed with increasing concern that the Senate is no longer fulfilling, as it once did, its raison d'etre, or purpose for being. 
   More and more, the offering of amendments in the Senate is being discouraged and debate is being stifled. I can say that because I've been here. Quite often, when bills or resolutions are called up for debate, the cloture motion is immediately laid down in an effort to speed the action on the measure and preclude non germane amendments. 
   Mike Mansfield, when he was leader, seldom did that. During the years that I was leader, I very seldom did that. The Republican leaders Baker and Dole seldom did that. 
   Following my tenure as majority leader, that has been done increasingly. I am not attempting to say that Mike Mansfield or I were great leaders at all; I am not attempting to do that. But I am saying that through Johnson's tenure, for the most part, through Mansfield's tenure, through my tenure as majority leader and through the tenures of Howard Baker and Bob Dole, the Senate adhered to its rules and precedents; seldom did it do otherwise. 
   Moreover, the parliamentary amendment tree is frequently filled as a way of precluding the minority from calling up amendments. I filled the parliamentary tree on a very few occasions. I, again, have to call attention to my own tenure as majority leader because through the tenures of Johnson and leaders before Johnson on both sides of the aisle, the rules of the Senate were virtually considered sacred. 
   The minority is also frequently pressured to keep the number of amendments to a minimum or else the particular bill will not even be called up--or, if it is pending, the bill will be taken down unless amendments are kept to a minimum. That is happening in this Senate. 
   Unlike the House of Representatives, there is no Rules Committee in the Senate that serves as a traffic cop over the legislation and that determines whether or not there will be any amendments and, if so, how many amendments will be allowed and who will call up such amendments. On occasion, the House Rules Committee will determine perhaps that one amendment will be called up by Mr. So-and-So. But not so with the Senate. We don't have a Rules Committee that serves as a traffic cop. 
   Could there be a desire on the part of the Senate majority leadership to make the Senate operate as a second House of Representatives? Of the 100 Senators who constitute this body today, 45, at my last count, came from the House of Representatives--45 out of 100. At no time in my almost 42 years in the Senate have I ever entertained the notion that the Senate ought to be run like the House of Representatives, where amendments and unlimited debate are often looked upon as alien to the legislative process. What is the hurry? What is the hurry? There is ample time for the offering of amendments and for debating them at length, if the Senate will only put its shoulder to the wheel and work. 
   We still have 7 days, just as there were in the beginning of creation. The calendar doesn't go that far back, but we still have 7 days a week. And we still have 24 hours a day, as was the case in Caesar's time. And the edict of God, as he drove Adam and Eve from the garden and laid down the law that by the sweat of his brow man would eat bread--that edict is still the case. We still have to eat bread and we still are supposed to earn our living through the sweat of our brow. Nothing has changed. 
   We have plenty of time. And we get paid. I am one who gets paid for my work in the Senate. I don't like Sunday sessions, but we have had a few over the years. I am against Sunday sessions. But I am not against working on Saturdays. During that civil rights debate, which I was talking about a while ago, there were six Saturdays in which the Senate was in session. It is not an unheard of thing. 
   It is far more important for the Senate to engage in thorough debate and for Senators to have the opportunity to call up amendments than it is for the Senate to have many of the Mondays and Fridays left unused insofar as real floor action is concerned.

   Mr. BYRD. Yes, I will very shortly. 
   It is far more important for the Senate to engage in thorough debate, and for Senators to have the opportunity to call up amendments, than it is for the Senate to be out of session on Mondays and Fridays. It seems to me that we should 
   be more busily engaged in doing the people's business. 
   Instead, it seems to me--and, of course, I am not infallible in my judgments--it seems to me that the Senate is more concerned about relieving Senators who are up for reelection--and I am one of them this year--relieving Senators who are up for reelection from the inconvenience of staying on the job and working early and late, than in fulfilling our responsibilities to our constituents. Some might conclude that it is more important for Senators to have Mondays and Fridays in which to raise money for a reelection campaign than it is for us to give to our constituents a full day's work for a full day's pay. 
   Now I am glad to yield to my friend.

   Mr. BYRD. There is no question about that, if one looks at the facts carefully. Having been majority leader and having been minority leader, I can testify as to the pressures that are brought on the majority and minority leaders by Senators who have to get out and run across this country, holding out a tin cup as it were, saying: Give me, give me, give me money. 
   I have had to do that. In 1982, I had an incumbent in the other body from West Virginia who ran against me. I had to go all over this country. I had to go to California. I had to go to New York. I had to go to Alabama. I had to go to Texas. I was all over the country. But I didn't go during the Senate workdays, and in those days, the Senate worked. I had to go on Sundays, for the most part.

   Mr. BYRD. They are much worse, and they are growing worse and worse and worse every day and every election. It is a disgrace and it is demeaning. The most demeaning thing that I have had to do in my political career is to ask people for money. 
   When I was majority leader in the 100th Congress, former Senator David Boren of Oklahoma and I introduced legislation to reform the campaign financing system. 
   I am not one of the ``come lately boys'' in this regard. I, as majority leader then, and former Senator David Boren introduced that legislation. The other side of the aisle--I do not like to point to the other side of the aisle as so many Senators today, unfortunately,  like to do--but the other side of the aisle--namely, the Republicans in the Senate in that instance--voted consistently eight times against cloture motions that I offered to bring the debate to a close. There were four or five Republicans who did break from the otherwise solid bloc and voted with the Democrats on that occasion to break the filibuster against the campaign financing bill. 
   Go back to the RECORD. Read it. Senators might do well to go back to the RECORD and see who those Senators were who broke from the Republican bloc. A handful broke from the Republican bloc and voted to end the filibuster against that campaign financing bill. Eight times I offered cloture motions. No other majority leader has ever offered eight cloture motions on the same legislation in one Congress. And eight times I was defeated in my efforts to invoke cloture. 
   Chapter 22, Verse 28 of the Book of Proverbs--we are talking about Solomon's sayings now for the most part--admonishes us: ``Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.'' We seem to be doing just the opposite. The Founding Fathers' grant to us of the right to amend and the right to unlimited debate has been, I believe, shifted off course, to the point that these two well-advised attributes of power are being voided, and for what reason? Could it be that the Senate Republican leadership fails to appreciate and fully understand the Senate, fails to understand American Constitutionalism, and fails to understand the purposes which the constitutional framers had in mind when they created the Senate. Or might we suppose that the senatorial powers that be are simply determined to be a Committee of Rules unto themselves and are determined to try to remold the Senate into a second House of Representatives? The fact cannot be ignored that 45 of the 100 Members of today's Senate came here from the House of Representatives. A political observer might also be surprised to find that 59 of today's 100 Senators came to the Senate subsequent to my final stint as majority leader. 
   Noble are the words of Cicero when he tells us that ``It is the first and fundamental law of history that it neither dare to say anything that is false or fear to say anything that is true, nor give any just suspicion of favor or disaffection.'' 
   I believe that no less a high standard must be invoked when considering the Senate of today and comparing it with the Senate of the past. Having spent more than half of my life in the Senate, I would consider myself derelict in my duty toward the Senate if I did not express my concerns over what I see happening to the Senate. 
   Who suffers, whose rights are denied, whose interests are untended when a Senate minority is denied the right to amend and when a Senate minority is denied the right and opportunity to fully debate the issues that confront the Nation? Is it the individual Senators themselves? Is it I? Do I suffer? No. It is their constituents, it is my constituents who are being denied these opportunities and these rights. It is not Senator so-and-so who, in the final analysis, is being denied the full freedom of speech on this Senate floor or who is being shut out from offering an amendment--it is Senator so-and-so's constituents, the people who sent him or her to the Senate. 
   If the Senate is intended to be a check against the impulsiveness and passions of the other body, is not the ability of the Senate to be such a check reduced in direct proportion to the denial to its Members of the opportunity to amend House measures? 
   In accordance with the Constitution, revenue bills must originate in the House of Representatives and, by custom, most appropriations bills likewise originate in the House, but under the guarantees of the Constitution, as those guarantees flowed from the Great Compromise of July 16, 1787, the Senate has the right to amend those revenue and appropriations bills. 
   But if the opportunity for Senators to amend is reduced, or even denied, as is sometimes being done, the Senate as an equal body to that of the House of Representatives is being put to a disadvantage. The House can open the door to legislation on an appropriations bill, but if the Senate, if the 100 Senators are denied the opportunity to offer amendments, or are limited in the number of amendments which Senators may offer, the Senate is thereby denied the opportunity to go through that door with amendments of its own, through the door that the other body has opened, and is denied the potential for the achievement of truly good legislation in the final result, and that opportunity is accordingly lessened and the likelihood of legislative errors in the final product is increased. 
   If the Senate is a forum of the States, in which the small States are equal to the large States, and if this ability of the small States to acquire equilibrium with the large States serves as an offset to the House of Representatives where the votes of the States are in proportion to population sizes, then when the Senate is denied the opportunity to work its will by the avoidance of votes on amendments, are the small States not the greater losers? My State, for one. The Senator from Alaska's State is one. 
   If the framers saw the Senate as a powerful check against an overreaching executive at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, when free and unlimited debate is bridled and the right of Senators to offer amendments is hindered or denied, is not the Senate's power to check an overreaching President accordingly whittled down, especially in instances where such a check is most needed? 
   I am gravely concerned that, if the practices of the recent past as they relate to enactment of massive, monstrous, omnibus appropriations bills are not reversed, Senators will be reduced to nothing more than legislative automatons. Senators will have given away their sole authority to debate and amend spending bills and other legislation. Much of that authority will have been handed over, by invitation of Congress itself, to the Chief Executive. 
   The distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and I, and other chairmen of appropriations subcommittees in this Senate are experiencing this right now. 
   Only yesterday, in a conference on the Interior Appropriation bill, I called attention to the fact that when I came to Congress 48 years ago, the Members of the House and Senate in that day would have stood in utter astonishment, to see in that conference, on an appropriations bill, the agents of the President of the United States sitting there arguing with Senators and House Members and advancing the wishes of a President. 
   There they sat in the House-Senate conference. And they tell the conferees what the President will or will not accept in the bill. If this is in the bill, he will veto it. If this is not in the bill, he will veto it, they say. 
   So, appropriators of the House and the Senate, get ready. You have company. There are other appropriators in this Government other than the elected Members of the House and Senate. There are administration ex officio members of the Appropriations conference--believe it or not--who sit like Banquo's ghost at the table when the appropriations are being administered out. What a sad--what a sad--thing to behold. 
   I said that in the meeting yesterday, as I have said it before in meetings. And I don't mean it to insult or to derogate the agents of the President. They are doing their job, and they are very capable people. I have to apologize to them when I say that. They are there through no fault of their own. 
   And why are they there? The fault lies here. Because we dither and dither almost a full year through. We put off action on appropriations bills until the very last, when we are up against the prospect of adjournment sine die, when our backs are to the wall, and then the President of the United States has the upper hand. His threats of veto make us scatter and run. The result is that all of these bills--or many of them--are crammed into one giant monstrous measure, and that measure comes back to this House without Senators having an opportunity to amend it because it is a conference report. It is not amendable --not amendable. So it is our fault. It really is. And it has been happening in these recent years. So much of that authority will have been handed over, by invitation of Congress itself, in essence, to the Executive. 
   For fiscal year 1999 an omnibus package was all wrapped together--Senators will remember this--an omnibus  package was all wrapped together and run off on copy machines--it totaled some 3,980 pages--and was presented to the House and Senate in the form of an unamendable conference report. Members were told to take it or leave it. If you do not take this agreement, we will have to stay here and start this process over. We will have to call Members back to Washington from the campaign trail, back to Washington from town meetings, and back to Washington from fundraisers. Senator, the gun is at your head, and it is loaded. You do not know what is in this package, Senator 3,980 pages put together by running the pages--3,980 pages--through copy machines. 
   Not a single Senator, not one knew what was in that conference report, the details of it. No one Senator under God's heaven knew, really, everything that he was voting on. You do not know what is in this package, we are essentially told, but you either vote for it or we will stay here and start all over again. And in the final analysis, we will come up with about the same package. 
   We know that these legislative provisions made up more than half of the total 3,980 pages. So what we did there, as we did in fiscal year 1997 and as we did again in fiscal year 2000 was put together several appropriations bills into an unamendable conference report, and Members were forced to vote on what was essentially a pig in a poke without knowing the details. 
   Do the people of this country know that? Do they know this? Do they know what is happening? 
   In 1932, in the midst of the Great Depression, a reporter from the Saturday Evening Post asked John Maynard Keynes, the great British economist, if he knew of anything that had ever occurred like that depression. Keynes answered: Yes, and it was called the Dark Ages, and it lasted 400 years. 
   Well, I can say, as one who lived through that depression in a coal mining town in southern West Virginia and was brought up in the home of a coal miner, I can say that we are now entering the 
   ``Dark Ages'' of the United States Senate. 
   Now, when Keynes referred to the Dark Ages being equal to the depression or vice versa and I refer to the Dark Ages of the Senate, this is calamity howling on a cosmic scale perhaps, but on one point, the resemblence seems valid, that being, the people never fully understood and don't fully understand today the forces that brought these things into being. 
   If the people knew that we had a 3,980-page conference report in which we, their elected representatives, didn't know what was in it, they would rise up and say: What in the world is going on here? It is our money that Senators are spending. You are blindfolded and you have wax in your ears. You don't even know what is in that bill. 
   Is this the way we want the House and the Senate to operate? Is this what Senators had in mind when they ran for the United States Senate? If we continue this process, Senators will not be needed here at all. Oh, you can come to the Senate floor once in a while to make a speech or to introduce a bill or to vote on some matter, but at the end of the session, when the rubber hits the road and we get down to what is and what is not going to be enacted in all areas--appropriations, legislation, and tax measures--most Senators won't be needed. Most of us will not be in the room with the President's men. We won't be in the room. 
   I have seen times when the minority, Democrats in the House and Senate, were not in the room. Who was in the room? The Republican majority, the Speaker of the House and the majority leader of the Senate. They were in the room. Who else? Who was there to represent us Democrats? Who was there? The executive branch was there, its agents. We were left out. The Democratic Members of the House and Senate, not one, not one sat in that conference. I wasn't in it. I was the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   So most of us will not be in the room when the decisions are made. The President's agents will be there. They will carry great weight on all matters because we have to get the President's signature. Having squandered the whole year in meaningless posturing and bickering back and forth, we will have no alternative, none, but to buckle under to a President's every demand. And when that hideous process is mercifully finished, we will then call you, Senator, and let you know that we are now ready to vote on a massive conference report, up or down, without any amendments in order. Take it or leave it, Senator. Take it or leave it, Senator DASCHLE. You are the minority leader. You will be left out. Take it or leave it; here is the conference report. 
   We are in danger of becoming an oligarchy disguised as a Republic. You may well spend all of your time campaigning or speechmaking or doing constituent services back home, you will have very little to say on legislation or appropriations or tax matters. 
   There is sufficient blame to go around for this total collapse of the appropriations process. Our side feels muzzled. The majority leader has a very difficult job. 
   I know. I have been in his shoes. He has to do the best he can to meet the demands of all Senators. 
   Part of the solution has to be a greater willingness to work together on both sides of the aisle to ensure that ample opportunities are provided, early in the session, outside of the appropriations process to debate policy differences. We simply must force ourselves to work harder, beginning earlier in the session, to ensure that we do not continue to abuse the Constitution, abuse the Senate, and ultimately abuse the American people by following the procedure that has resulted in these omnibus packages in 3 of the last 4 years, and which, I fear, is about to be resorted to again this year. 
   I do see some rays of hope because we have awakened the leadership. I must say, after our squawking and screaming and kicking, the administration this year is insisting that Democrats sit at the table when the crumbs are being parceled out. They insisted because the minority leader has insisted on it and because other voices in the Senate have been complaining. 
   Cicero said: ``There is no fortress so strong that money cannot take it.'' The power of the purse is the most precious power that we have. It was given to the two Houses by the Constitution, the bedrock of our Government. It was put here--not down at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. 
   I have tried to do my part to help Senators understand our constitutional role. We are the people's elected representatives and they have entrusted us with their vote; those people out there who are watching through the cameras have entrusted us with their vote. That trust must not be treated lightly. This is especially true when it comes to matters that involve appropriations. We are spending their money. 
   Each of you who is watching through that electronic medium, we are spending your money. 
   We are stewards of the people's hard-earned tax dollars. They expect, and they ought to demand, that we spend those dollars wisely, and that we scrutinize what we fund and why we fund it. 
   The Senate is the upper House of a separate branch of Government, with institutional safeguards that protect the people's liberties. 
   Which party commands the White House at a given time should make no difference as to how we conduct our duties. We are here to work with, but also to act as a check on the occupant of the White House, regardless of who that occupant is. And we are here to reflect the people's will. We are not performing the watchdog function when we invite the White House--literally invite the White House--behind closed doors and play five-card draw with the people's tax dollars. 
   Mr. President, I fear for the future of this Senate. I think the people are very disenchanted with Congress and with politics in general. They are catching on to our partisan bickering and they don't like what they hear and see. 
   The people are hungry for leadership. They ask us for solutions to their problems. They expect us to protect their 
   interests and to watch over their hard-earned tax dollars. They entrust us with their franchise and they ask that we ponder issues and debate issues and use their proxy wisely. They ask that we protect their freedoms by holding fast to our institutional and constitutional responsibilities.  
   Too often, we lose sight of the fact that partisan politics is not the purpose for which the people send us here. We square off like punch-drunk gladiators and preen and polish our media-slick messages in search of the holy grail of power or a headline. I am a politician; I can say that. We fail to educate the people and ourselves on issues of paramount and far-reaching importance for this generation and for the next generation. It is a shame and it is a waste because there is much talent in this Chamber, and there is much mischanneled energy. This Senate could be what the framers intended, but it would take a new commitment by each of us to our duties and to our oaths of office. And it would take a massive turning away from the petty little power wars so diligently waged each week and each month in these Halls. 
   Our extreme tunnel vision has been duly noted by the American people, I assure Senators. The American people are a tolerant lot, but their patience is beginning to fray. 
   And when their disappointment turns to dismay, and finally to disgust, we will have no one to blame but ourselves. 
   Mr. President, I have more to say, but I see other Senators. If they wish to speak on this subject, I will be glad to yield them time. Does the distinguished Senator from California wish to speak?

   Mr. BYRD. I want to clarify one thing. 
   The distinguished Senator from California earlier, I think, indicated that she and I were in disagreement on this. We are not. In the Senate, there is no rule of germaneness except when cloture is invoked and except when rule XVI is invoked. But a rule XVI invocation can be waived only by a majority vote--not a two-thirds vote but by a majority. We have done that many times. 
   When a Senator has raised the question of germaneness, I have from time to time voted with that question to make that germane. She and I really are not in disagreement. She has well stated, and so has the distinguished Senator from Iowa, the reasons why so many Senators are forced to offer legislative amendments on appropriations bills. It is because the legislative measures are not brought up in the Senate. So they have to resort to the only vehicle that is in front of them, that being an appropriations bill. 
   Look at this calendar. This calendar is filled with bills, many of them which have never gone to the committee. Many of them have been put directly on the calendar through rule XIV, and they have never been before a committee. They went before a committee in the House, come from the House, and are put directly on the Senate calendar, or bills are offered by Senators, brought up, and through rule XIV are placed on the calendar. 
   I counted the number of items on this calendar the other day that have been placed directly on the calendar for one reason or the other, one being rule XIV. I counted the number. I don't remember what it was. There are quite a wide number of amendments that are on the calendar that have never seen or experienced any debate in a Senate committee. We have 71 pages making up this calendar. 
   Senators who want to offer amendments have to understand, there is nothing but appropriations bills to which to offer amendments.

   Mr. BYRD. I yield an additional 15 minutes overall to the Senator from California. 
   Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa said something here which is a truism--among other things--that there are many who look upon the rules and the precedence of the Senate as gobbledygook, as inside baseball. 
   Now I daresay those same narrow-minded, uninformed people, whoever they are, would say the very same about this Constitution of the United States or this Declaration of Independence, both of which are in this little book which I hold in my hand. They would say the same thing about the Constitution of the United States, and those rules of the Senate are there by virtue of this Constitution. 
   I urge them to read the Constitution again. 
   I also urge them to read what Thomas Jefferson said, what Vice President Adlai Stevenson said, what Lyndon Johnson said, and what other great leaders who are now in the past said about the right to amend and the right to debate. 
   I will say what Adlai Stevenson said: They know not what they do. 
   I thank the Senator.

   Mr. BYRD. On what the distinguished Senator is saying, the difference between a lynching and a fair trial is process. 
   Mr. President, I have to be away from the Senate for about an hour and a half. I have to meet with my wife of 63 years, so I must leave the floor. 
   I ask unanimous consent that no time be charged against my time, time that is under my control, unless that time is being used on the subject that is before the Senate. In other words, if no Senator is on the floor to speak on this subject, and he or she wishes to speak on some other subject, that he can get time but that it not be charged against the time on this matter. 
   There are several Senators who wish to speak on this. But for the moment, I am going to take the liberty of yielding control of time--oh, the minority whip is here; he will take care of that matter. He will be in control of time. I make that request.

   Mr. BYRD. The Senator asked for 2 minutes. I will give him 4. 
   Mr. President, let me say to the Senator, the Patients' Bill of Rights, absolutely, if there is an opportunity to pass that, if it takes twice, if it takes three times, if it takes six times, fine, I am for it. 
   Minimum wage: I am one who used to work at less--less--than the minimum wage by far. If we pass it, yes. So we are not in disagreement on that. 
   I think the Senator referenced, a little earlier, two times when I have felt that we are calling up an amendment just as a political amendment and doing it over and over and over again. That is different from what he is speaking of. I am not for that. I am not for taking the time on an amendment which has no opportunity, no future, no possibility of passing.  
   But in these cases, it is obvious. And the way he has described these has produced such a vivid picture of need that I am very supportive of trying again. There are reasons why one might try again and win. And the Senator has just stated it with reference to the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   So I congratulate this Senator, who does so much for the Senate, who has so much to offer, who has such great talents, and who does not hide those talents in a napkin but produces fivefold or tenfold. I congratulate him and salute him. I thank him for what he has said on the Senate floor today. 
   So I have yielded him 4 minutes. And I have taken how much?

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, let me comment on a couple of things that the distinguished Senator from Illinois just said. 
   The Senator from Illinois served in the other body and he served on the Appropriations Committee. He comes to this body bringing great talent, one of the most talented Members that I have ever seen in this body. He brings great talent to this chamber. He can speak on any subject. He is similar to Mr. DORGAN, and can speak on any subject at the drop of a hat. He is very articulate, he is smart, and I am proud to have him as a fellow Member. 
   Now, he mentioned a change that was made in basketball. I wish that they would make another change in basketball. When I talk about ``basketball'' that is a subject concerning which I know almost nothing. But I have watched a few basketball games. I can remember how they played them when I was in high school, which was a long time ago. But it really irritates me to see basketball players run down the court with that ball and jump up and hang on the hoop and just drop the ball through the basket. If I were 7 feet tall, I could drop the ball through the basket, even at age 83. If I were that tall, and I did not have to shoot from the floor to make that basket, I could do it, too. I wonder why they don't get back to the old way of requiring players to shoot from the floor. In the days when I was in high school, players had to shoot from the floor. They weren't 7-feet tall. A 6 foot 2 center in my high school was a tall boy. 
   But, anyhow, so much for basketball. 
   The distinguished Senator has talked about how we have plenty of time to do our work. The first year I came to the House of Representatives, in 1953, we adjourned sine die on August 3; 2 years later, we adjourned sine die on August 2; the next year, we adjourned sine die on July 27. We did our work. We did not have the breaks we have now. Easter? We might have been out Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. We didn't have the breaks then, but we passed the appropriations bills. 
   We didn't do any short-circuiting, and the Appropriations Committees of both Houses acted on a much higher percentage of the total moneys that were spent by the Federal Government. I think there was a time when the Appropriations Committees passed on 90 percent of the moneys that the Federal Government spent. Today, we probably act on less than a third of the total moneys spent. So don't tell me that we can't get this work done. We used to do it. We can do it again. 
   Now while I am talking about the Senator from Illinois being a new Member--relatively new in this body--he comes well equipped to this body. I have been calling attention to the fact that 59 percent--59 Senators--have come to the Senate since I walked away from the majority leader's job. I mentioned Lyndon Johnson as a majority leader; I mentioned Mike Mansfield as a majority leader; I mentioned ROBERT C. BYRD as a majority leader. I should not overlook the stellar performances of Howard Baker, a Republican majority leader; or Robert Dole, a Republican majority leader. We hewed the line when it came to the Senate rules and precedents. They honored those rules and precedents. We didn't have any shortcutting, any short-circuiting of appropriations bills, like going direct to conference and avoiding action on this floor. I want to mention those two Republican leaders because they were also in my time. 
   Mr. President, 27 of the 50 States are especially fortunate this year. They have Senators on the Senate Appropriations Committee. These lucky 27 states, containing a total estimated 147,644,636 individuals as of July 1999, account for over half of our population of 272,171,813. However, 23 of these United States--and I have them listed on a chart here. I have them listed as the 25 have-nots--23 of these States are in a different situation. They have no direct representation on the Senate Appropriations Committee. Due to the rather unique situation in which we find ourselves this year, three appropriations bills--bills which fund roughly 100 agencies and departments of the Federal Government--may never be considered on the Senate floor. If that is the case, some 125 million Americans who happen to live in those 23 States will have no direct input regarding the decisions of the Senate committee that directly controls the discretionary budget of the United States. The countless decisions on funding and policies in those three bills will not have been presented on the Senate floor in a form that allows the elected Senators from those 23 States to debate and amend those 3 appropriations bills; namely, the FY2001 Commerce/Justice/State, Treasury-Postal, and VA-HUD bills. 
   This is not the fault of the Appropriations Committee. I cannot and I will not blame Senator STEVENS, the very capable Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, whom I know wants to shepherd each bill through his committee to the floor, and through the conference committee process in the appropriate manner. His efforts have been hamstrung because of a budget process that sets an unrealistically low level of funding, a level of funding that could not possibly address in any adequate way the demands placed upon it by the administration or by the Senate, and because the Senate has not taken up many important pieces of authorization and policy legislation this year. 
   I have nothing but praise for Senator TED STEVENS. I have seen many chairmen of the Appropriations Committee of the Senate. I have been on that Senate Appropriations Committee 42 years--longer, now, than any other Senator in history on that Appropriations Committee. I have seen many chairmen. I have never seen one better than Senator TED STEVENS. 
   Additionally, cloture has been filed too quickly on many bills, in order to further limit amendment opportunities. Appropriations bills have, as a result, become an even stronger magnet for controversial amendments than usual. That always complicates the process. Further, the administration has not waited until the Senate has finished its business before issuing veiled or blatant veto threats in an attempt to influence the appropriations process. So, I am very sympathetic to the situation in which my good friend, Senator STEVENS, now finds himself. 
   Whatever the reasons, however, these 23 have-not states will be deprived of their right to debate and amend these bills through their elected Senators if we wrap these remaining bills into House/Senate conference reports without first taking them up on the Senate floor. They will get only a yea or nay vote on an entire appropriations conference report. There will be no chance to debate or amend the contents of those bills. The 15 million people in Florida--up or down votes, with no amendments. The 11 million people in Ohio--up or down votes on conference reports, with no amendments. The 479,000 people in Wyoming--up or down votes is all they will get, with no amendments. The same goes for the  residents of Virginia, Georgia, Louisiana, Michigan, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Maine. 
   Those citizens should also be upset. So should the residents of Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, and Tennessee. Those folks will have no input into hundreds of thousands of spending decisions. They will summarily be told to take that conference report without any amendments; take it; vote up or down, take it or leave it. 
   I heard a Member of this Senate yesterday--I believe it was yesterday--decry the President's threat to veto an appropriations bill if something called the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act was not passed. That Senator said yesterday that a President who would make such threats was acting like a king. I agree. That threat was outrageous. If that threat was made, it was outrageous. It should not have been made. Further, I agree with that Senator's feeling about the piece of legislation which caused the White House threat. I voted against suspending the rule that would have made it possible to consider it. But when it comes to this President, or any President, Democrat or Republican acting like a king, let me say that we in this body are the ultimate check on that assumption of the scepter and crown that all Presidents would like to make. 
   When we in the Congress invite the President's men to sit at the table--essentially that is what we do when we delay these appropriations bills until the very last and have to act upon them with our backs to the wall and facing an almost immediate sine die adjournment, we in effect invite the administration's people to sit at the table and be part of the decisions involving the power over the purse; yes, that power which is constitutionally reserved for the House and the Senate. When we do that and then deny the full Senate the right to debate and amend those spending bills, we are aiding and abetting that kingly demeanor. 
   When we hand over a seat at the table to the White House and lock out the full Senate, not just these 23 States, but lock out the full Senate on spending bills, we are, in truth, giving a President much more power than the framers ever intended. 
   We are charged in this body with staying the hand of an overreaching Executive. Instead, it sometimes seems as if we are polishing the chrome on the royal chariot and stacking it full of congressional prerogatives for a fast trip to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. 
   This year, one appropriations bill providing funding for the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State has been in limbo--limbo. I believe that Dante referred to limbo as the first circle of hell. Anyhow, this bill has been in limbo for more than 2 months in order to avoid controversial subjects coming up for debate and amendment. So that bill has been a sort of Wen Ho Lee of the Appropriations Committee. It has been in isolation--incommunicado, stowed away in limbo, out of sight, out of mind. But there it is on the calendar. It has been there for weeks. Controversial? Yes. Some amendments might be offered. But why not? That is the process. We should call it up and have those amendments and have a vote on them. Let's vote on them. 
   I have cast 15,876 votes in 42 years in this Senate. That is an attendance record of 98.7 percent. That may sound like bragging, but Dizzy Dean said it was all right to brag if you have done it. So I have a 98.7 percent voting attendance. I have never dodged a controversial vote, and I am still here and running again. And if it is the Good Lord's will and the will of the people of West Virginia, I will be around here when the new Congress begins. 
   I have cast controversial votes. What is wrong with that? That is why we come here. 
   Two other appropriations bills--DC and VA-HUD--were not even marked up by the committee until the second full week of September. There was not enough money to make the VA-HUD bill even minimally acceptable. But having been marked up and reported from the committee, was it called up on the Senate floor for consideration? No, it was not. It was just wrapped in dark glasses and a low-slung hat, surrounded with security and rushed straight into conference as if it contained secrets for the eyes of the Appropriations Committee only. The plan apparently is to insert the entire VA-HUD 
   bill into the conference agreement on another appropriations bill without bringing it before the Senate. I still am hopeful that a way can be found to bring up that bill, as well as the Treasury Postal and Commerce Justice bills to the Senate floor. 
   I know that some of my colleagues may argue that every Senator has a chance to make his or her requests known to the chairman and ranking member of each appropriations subcommittee, and in that way get their issues addressed in the bill even if it does not see action on the Senate floor. I certainly know that is true. I receive thousands of requests each year to each subcommittee, as well as the requests made while those bills are in conference. However, if a Member's request is not addressed in a bill and that bill does not see debate on the floor, that Member has no opportunity to take his or her amendment to the full Senate and get a vote on it. He has no way to test the decisions of the committee to see if a majority of the full Senate will support his amendment. 
   Additionally, when an appropriations bill is not debated by the full Senate, Senators who are not on the committee do not have the opportunity to strip objectionable items out of the bill. They do not have the ability to seek changes, perhaps very useful changes, to provisions in the bill that might hurt their States. They do not have a voice on the many policy decisions contained in appropriations bills. 
   The Appropriations Committee staff is a good one. The Members and the clerks are fair, and they try to do a good job. For the most part, they succeed and succeed admirably, and I am very proud of them. But we are all human. Sometimes we do not always see the unintended consequences of this or that provision, or we simply make a drafting error that could hurt one or more States or groups of people. The fresh eyes and different perspectives of our fellow Senators who are not on the Appropriations Committee, however, have caught such errors in the past and will, I am sure, do so again. But when those Members only get to vote on a conference report that is unamendable, their judgment is eliminated. That is not a sensible way to legislate. I think it is a sloppy way to legislate. I know that my distinguished chairman, Senator STEVENS, does not want to legislate in this manner. He is not afraid of any debate or any controversial amendments. TED STEVENS is not afraid of anything on God's green Earth that I know of. He has done a yeoman's job in trying to find sufficient funding within the budget system to move his bills, and I commend him for it. 
   I sincerely hope that we can all come together to find a way to help my chairman. The full Senate must do its duty on appropriations bills this year. We owe that to the Nation. We owe it to this institution in which we all serve. 
   Mr. President, the Senate is preparing to act on a short-term continuing resolution, 
   which will give the Senate an additional week to take up and debate appropriations bills, if we so choose. We can get a lot done in 7 days if we all put our shoulders to the wheel to heave this bulky omnibus, or these bulky minibuses, out of the mud. The Senate is surely not on a par with the Creator. We cannot pull Heaven and Earth, and all the creatures under the Sun out of the void before we rest. But with His help and His blessings, we surely can complete work on the remaining appropriations bills before we adjourn. 
   The Legislative Branch and Treasury/General Government appropriations conference report was defeated by the Senate on September 20. Some may have seen this as a defeat. But, in fact, that was no defeat. It was a victory for the institution of the Senate, for the Constitution and its framers, and for the Nation. I think the defeat of that conference report in large measure can be laid at the door of this strategy, which emanates from somewhere here, of avoiding floor debate on appropriations bills. I am glad that many of my colleagues objected to being asked to vote on a nondebatable conference report containing a bill--now, get this--containing a bill, in this instance the  appropriations bill for the Department of the Treasury and for general Government purposes, that they have not had a chance to understand, to debate, to amend, or to influence. The Senate was designed to be a check on the House of Representatives. Moreover, the Senate was designed to even out the advantages that more populous States enjoy in the House, and to give small or rural States an even playing field in all matters, including appropriations. 
   This vote on the legislative branch, Treasury, and general government minibus--minibus--appropriations bill is a setback, as far as time goes, but, I still believe that we can rally, and complete our work in a manner that will allow us to leave with our heads held high, rather than with our tail between our legs. We can finish our work. The people expect it. We ought to do it. 
   In fact, in keeping with the rather screwball approach that we have been taking on appropriations matters this year, much of the conferencing on these bills has been taking place, even before the bills have been debated on the floor. 
   Surely we can build on this base, and still allow the Senate to work its will on the more contentious elements of these bills. It is our job to resolve these problems. We get paid to do it. We get paid well to do it. It may be true that we could get higher pay somewhere else--as a basketball player or as a TV anchor person or in some other job--but we get paid well for the job we do. 
   We are all familiar with these issues. We know the needs of our individual States. We need to have that debate about these issues, and we need to engage the brains of 100 members of this body to get the very best results. I would far rather--far rather--see this process take place, and send good bills to the President to sign or veto, than to see Senators simply abdicating our constitutional role in formulating the funding priorities for our Nation. The bad taste of recent years' goulash of appropriations, tax, and legislative vehicles all sloshed together in a single omnibus pot has not yet left my mouth. That is the easy way, but it is the wrong way. I didn't want a second or third helping, much less a fourth. It is loaded with empty calories, and full of carcinogens. Moreover, we are poisoning the institutional role of the U.S. Senate, rendering it weaker and weaker in influence and in usefulness. We are slowly eroding the Senate's ability to inform and to represent the people, and sacrificing its wisdom--the wisdom of the Senate--and its unique place in our Republic on the cold altar of ambition and expediency. All it takes is our will to see what we are doing and turn away from the course that we are on. I urge Senators to come together and do our work for our country. 
   I thank all Senators who have spoken on this subject today.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, earlier today I voted against suspending the rule to allow for the consideration of the Latino and Immigration Fairness Act as an amendment to the H-1B visa legislation. 
   I opposed suspending the rules because the Latino and Immigration Fairness Act sends the wrong message to those persons who might consider illegally entering the United States. Under current law, a person who enters this country as a temporary alien or nonimmigrant must return to his native country after his temporary papers have expired if he wants to apply for permanent residency in the United States. This amendment would allow these nomimmigrants to pay a $1,000 fee to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in order to remain in the United States while they apply for permanent residency. Advocates of this provision argue that this fee would be a significant source of income for the INS. That may be so, but, at the same time, the amendment would allow for illegal immigrants to legally work in the United States while their residency application is pending, and send the message abroad that this is the preferred route to U.S. residence. Although it may be inconvenient for eligible aliens who are in the United States to have to apply for residency from outside of the United States, that is not a sufficient reason for giving them an advantage that is unavailable to other hopeful immigrants who are patiently waiting abroad for their opportunity to legally immigrate. 
   Similarly, the Latino and Immigration Fairness Act would extend the registration time line for immigrants who are here illegally to apply for permanent residence if they entered the country prior to 1986. While this provision would allow immigrants of good moral conduct to apply for permanent residency, it also rewards immigrants who managed to stay in the United States illegally. What is worse is, that it sends the unfortunate message that is possible to gain permanent residency in the United States regardless of whether you are an alien who arrived here legally or illegally. 
   I am opposed to Congress' sending these mixed signals to immigrants entering this country. The Immigration and Nationality Act, our primary law for regulating immigration into this country, sets out a very specific process by which nonimmigrants may apply for permanent residency in this country. The Latino and Immigration Fairness Act would effectively create short cuts around this process by allowing illegal immigrants to circumvent the normal rules. This is not the message I want to send abroad.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee for the District of Columbia, Senators KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON and RICHARD DURBIN, for the very fine work they have done to bring forward the District of Columbia appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001. 
   Even though this bill is neither the largest nor the most complex of the appropriations bills, it is not an easy bill to resolve. Senators HUTCHISON and DURBIN are to be commended for working together and bringing this bill before the Senate. We have followed the regular order with this bill. The Senate has an opportunity to work its will on this measure. 
   With the passage of this bill, we have brought all but three fiscal year 2001 appropriations bills to the Senate floor. I call upon my colleagues to finish the Senate's work on these final three measures.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I was sitting in my office when I heard the very distinguished Senator from Idaho speaking on the floor and using my name. He asked for cooperation, and, of course, we all want to cooperate. We want good will and we want cooperation. But one way to get cooperation from this Senator when his name is going to be used is to call this Senator before the Senator who wishes to call my name goes to the floor and let me know that I am going to be spoken of. 
   I have been in the Senate 42 years, and I have never yet spoken of another Senator behind his back in any critical terms--never. I once had a jousting match with former Senator Weicker. He called my name on the floor a few times, and so I went to the floor and asked the Cloakroom to get in touch with Senator Weicker and have him come to the floor. I didn't want to speak about him otherwise, without his being on the floor. Frankly, I don't appreciate it. I like to be on the floor where I can defend myself.

   Mr. BYRD. Exactly. I think that rule keeps down acerbities and ill will. I want to retain good will. So when I refer to the distinguished Senator, I don't want to point the finger at him by saying ``you.'' 
   Now, Mr. President, I am not sure the Senator is entirely accurate in everything he has said. I didn't hear everything he said, but I have the impression that what he was saying was that we bundled bills together in times when I was majority leader, and so on. 
   I am not sure that is even accurate. But let me say to the distinguished Senator that I haven't complained about bundling bills together. That is not my complaint at all. My complaint is in avoiding debate in the Senate and sending appropriation bills directly to conference. That is my problem because that avoids the open debate in the Senate, and Senators are deprived of the opportunity, thereby, to offer amendments.  
   I don't mind bundling bills together in conference if they have passed the Senate. But if they haven't passed the Senate, I am very critical of sending those bills to the conference. I think the framers contemplated both Houses acting upon bills--and that is the way we have done it heretofore until the last few years; appropriation bills have passed the Senate; they have been amended and debated before they went to conference. That is my complaint. 
   So I hope the Senator will not feel that I have been complaining about bills being joined in conference. I am not complaining about that. 
   According to the CRS, all regular appropriation bills were approved by or on October 1 in 1977--the first year I became majority leader--in 1989, in 1995, and in 1997. So I have the record before me that shows that four times in those years--that is not a great record, but four times in those years all of the regular appropriations bills were approved by or on October 1. 
   The distinguished Senator, if I understood him correctly, said only twice. Am I correct that only twice had all appropriations bills been approved on or before October 1?

   Mr. BYRD. By October 1. The RECORD shows that in 4 years, all of the regular appropriations bills were approved by or on October 1. 
   I can remember in 1977, I believe it was, that all of the appropriations bills were passed but the last one, which passed the Senate by just a few seconds before the hour of midnight at the close of the fiscal year. Obviously, it would not have been in time for the President to have signed the bill by the next day. But all bills did pass the Senate even though the last of the appropriations bills only made it by a few seconds or a few minutes. And in 1987, more than 100 amendments were offered, debated, and disposed of in the consideration of the continuing resolution. We took up amendments, we debated them, and disposed of them. 
   That is what I am complaining about. I will have more to say about this in a few days. But I am complaining about the fact that appropriations bills are brought to the Senate floor, and in many instances Senators don't have the opportunity to offer amendments and have them debated. They don't have the opportunity to debate the bills fully. 
   Secondly, I am complaining about sending appropriations bills directly to conference without the Senate's having an opportunity to debate those appropriations bills and to amend them prior to their going to conference. That short-circuits the legislative process. We represent the people who send us here. This is the only forum of the States. I represent a State, the distinguished Senator from Idaho represents a State, and represents it well. But it doesn't make any difference about the size of the State. Each State is equal in this body--meaning that small, rural States like West Virginia are equal to the large States of New York, California, Texas, and so on. 
   But when the Senate is deprived of the opportunity to debate and to amend by virtue of appropriations bills being sent directly to conference, this means the people of my State, the people of the small States, the people of the rural States--the people of every State, as a matter of fact, represented in the Senate--are deprived of the opportunity to debate and are deprived of the opportunity to offer amendments through their Senators. 
   This is what I am complaining about. I have tried to avoid personalities. I could do that. I don't like to do that. I am just stating a fact that we are being deprived, the Senator from Idaho is being deprived of debating and offering amendments. His people are being deprived. That is the important thing--his constituents are being deprived. I think we ought to quit that. I think we ought to stop it. 
   I hope the distinguished Senator will stand with me in 
   opposition to what I call the emasculation of the appropriations process when that is done.

   Mr. BYRD. That is part of the process. 
   When I was majority leader of the Senate in 1977, 1978, 1979, and 1980 and, again, when I was majority leader of the Senate in 1987 and 1988, not once did I attempt to say to the leader on the other side of the aisle that I will not take this bill up if you are going to call up amendments, or if you call up 5 or 10 or whatever it is, I will not call it up; or having called it up, if Senators on the other side of the aisle persisted in calling up amendments, I didn't take the bill down. That is part of the process. 
   That is where we differ. There are now Senators in this body who think that that is the way the Senate has always been. I would say to Senator Baker, or to Senator Dole, let's have our respective Cloakrooms find out how many amendments there are. And the Cloakrooms would call Senators. They would bring back a list of the Senators on the Republican side and a list of the Senators on the Democratic side who indicated they had amendments. I never said: Well, we ought to cut them down. I said: Let's list them. 
   Sometimes there would be 65 amendments, sometimes 80, or whatever. I would say: Let's get unanimous consent that the amendments be limited to those on the list. I never attempted to keep Senators from calling up their amendments, or to insist the leader of the other side cut down his amendments before we would call up the bill. We listed the amendments. Then we sought to get unanimous consent. Usually we could because we worked well together. Once we had the finite list of amendments and got unanimous consent that that would be all of the amendments, we began to then work with each individual Senator--Mr. Dole and Mr. Baker, through their staff on that side, and myself on my side. Our staff attempted to get time limitations on those amendments. Many of the amendments just went away. Senators would do as I have done on several occasions: I had my name put on the list just for a ``germane'' amendment and just for self-protection. 
   So that is the way it is. Many times, amendments fall off. 
   I have to say that this new way of doing things here is not the way the  Senate has always done it. There are 59 Senators today in this body--I believe I am correct--there are 59 Senators out of 100 Senators who never served in the Senate prior to my giving up the leadership at the end of 1988. 
   Rules VII and VIII--there are two rules I just happened to think of that have never been utilized since I was majority leader. Never. And there are other rules that have never been utilized since I was majority leader. Fifty-nine Senators have come into the Senate not having seen the Senate operate as it did when Mr. Mansfield was here, when Lyndon Johnson was here, and when I was leader. What they see is a new way of operating in the Senate. 
   Many of those Senators--I believe 48 of the Senators--here I am speaking from memory; I may have missed one or two--have come over from the other body. I am one of them. But there are 48, maybe 47 or 52, or thereabouts, of today's Senators who have come over to the Senate from the House. They have never seen the Senate operate under its rules, really, unless we call operating by unanimous consent operating by the rules--which would be accurate to say, up to a point. But 48 Senators have come over from the House and many of those Senators would like to make the Senate another House of Representatives. The Senate was not supposed to be an adjunct to the House. 
   I have been in the other House. I have long studied the rules and the precedents and worked in the leadership in one capacity or another in this Senate. I served in the Democratic leadership 22 years here, as whip, as secretary of the conference, as majority leader, as minority leader, as majority leader again. 
   I grieve over what is happening to the Senate. I say we need to get back to the old way of doing things because we are short circuiting the process. In so doing, we are depriving the people of the States of the representation that they are entitled to in this Senate. By that I mean that the people's Senators are not allowed to call up amendments, they are not allowed to debate at times. This way of operating would certainly, I think, bring sadness to the hearts of the framers because they intended for this Senate to be a check on the other body. They also intended for this Senate to be a check against an overreaching executive. But if Senators can't call up bills from the other body and debate them and amend them, then the Senate cannot adequately check the other body against the passions that may temporarily sweep over the country. The Senate cannot bring stability to the body politic and to the government that the framers intended. 
   I am happy to yield again.

   Mr. BYRD. Well, my memory, which is not infallible, reminds me that the President of the United States asked for an omnibus bill that year. He didn't want separate bills. Mr. Reagan didn't want separate bills that year. He wanted an omnibus bill. I hope I am not mistaken in the year that we are discussing. 
   But does the Senator not recall one year in which Mr. Reagan did not want--he wanted one bill because we were entering into some kind of an agreement amongst us; he wanted one bill to sign rather than several. So we accommodated him.

   Mr. BYRD. I am looking at the chart, ``Final Status of Appropriation Measures, First Session, 100th Congress.'' That would have been 1987. Every bill was reported. I think I am getting now to the question that the Senator asked. 
   Some of the bills were reported but not taken up, but floor action shows that the Senate continued to act upon appropriations bills: Treasury-Postal Service was acted upon on the floor September 25; Transportation, October 29; military construction, October 27; legislative, September 30; Labor-HHS-Education, October 14; Interior, September 30; energy and water, November 18; Commerce-Justice, October 15. 
   So they were all acted on. And, yes, the answer is, the Senate continued to act upon those bills even through the latter months of the year.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, let me respond to that. The Senator] speaks of cooperation from the other side. I note that 1, 2, 3, 5, 6--9 of these appropriations bills--10, 11--11 of them were reported from the Senate Appropriations Committee this year no later than July 21, reported and placed on the calendar--11 of them. 
   Why weren't they called up in the Senate? The Appropriations Committee, on which the distinguished Senator from Idaho and I sit, the Appropriations Committee, under the excellent leadership of Senator TED STEVENS, reported those bills out; 11 of them, I believe--no later than--what date was that? No later than the 21st of July. Why weren't they called up? We had plenty of time. Why weren't they called up? 
   May I say, in addition to that, the Senate certainly had the time to act on those bills. We were out of session on too many Fridays. We come in here on Monday, many Mondays, and we do not cast a vote, or we cast a vote at 5 o'clock, or we go out on Fridays, we don't have any session at all, or we go out by noon with perhaps one vote having been taken. 
   The Senator and I could talk until we are each blue in the face, but it seems to me that someone needs to explain in a reasonable way as to why we don't act on Mondays and Fridays, act as we ought to as a legislative body--be in session. We are getting paid for the work. Why don't we act on these appropriations bills? 
   When I was majority leader, I stood before my caucus in 207. I can remember saying it: ``We are not here to improve the quality of life for us Senators. Our constituents send us here to improve the quality of life for our constituents. I am interested in the quality of work.'' 
   My own colleagues were doing some complaining. I said: We are going to be here, we are going to vote early on Mondays, and we are going to vote late on Fridays. You elected me leader. As long as you leave me in as leader, I am going to lead. 
   Now, I said, we will take 1 week off every 4 weeks, and we can go home and talk to our constituents, see about their needs. So we will have 1 week off and 3 weeks in, but the 3 weeks that we are in, we are going to work early and we are going to work late. And we did that in the 100th Congress. 
   If one looks over the records of the 100th Congress, one will find that Congress was one of the best Congresses, certainly, that I have seen in my time here in Washington. The productivity was good, we worked hard, there was good cooperation between Republicans  and Democrats. We all worked, and appropriations bills didn't suffer. Appropriations bills were never sent to conference without prior action by this body. Every Senator in this body on both sides of the aisle was allowed to call up his amendment, to offer amendments, as many as he wanted to. Nobody was shut off. We just simply took the time. We stayed here and did the work. 
   Nobody can say to me, well, we don't have the time to do these bills. Mr. President, we have squandered the time. We have squandered the time already. I used to have bed check votes on Monday mornings at 10 o'clock, bed check votes so that the Senators would be here at 10 o'clock. It didn't go over well with some of the Senators, even on my side. But one leads or he doesn't lead. 
   When one leads, he sometimes runs into opposition from his own side of the aisle. I was not unused to that. But nobody can stand here and tell me that we have fully utilized our time and that we have to avoid bringing bills up in the Senate because Senators will offer amendments to them. I am ready to debate that anytime. 
   I thank the distinguished Senator. I will yield again if he wishes.

   Mr. BYRD. No, indeed. Never have I hoped that. I would like to have seen a time when Senators didn't want to call up amendments. Maybe I could have gone home earlier. But I have never thought that was a possibility. And I wouldn't hope they would go to the President clean because I think Senators ought to have the opportunity to clean up the bills, to improve them. Surely they are not perfect when they come over from the other body, and Senators ought to be at liberty to call up amendments and improve that legislation. That is the legislative process. Let's improve it.

   Mr. BYRD. I think we are ships going past one another in the dark, the Senator and I, on this. I am for having full debate, having Senators offer their amendments. Whether or not bills sent to the President are clean, to me, I think, is not a matter of great import. I think the framers contemplated that each House, the House in the beginning on revenue bills and then the Senate on revenue bills by amendment and the House and Senate on other bills, sometimes one House would go first, sometimes the other House would go first except on revenue bills, by practice, appropriations bills. 
   To me, in the legislative process, the people are getting their just rights, the people are getting what they are entitled to, and the Republic will flourish and the liberties of the people will endure if Senators have an opportunity to debate fully--disagree, agree, offer amendments, have them tabled, have them voted up or down. This Republic will be in a much safer position and in a much better condition if the Senate is allowed to be what the Senate was intended to be by the framers. 
   I hope the Senator will join with me in protecting this Senate and in doing so will protect the liberties of the people. Protect the Senate. Forget about party once in a while. George Washington warned us against factions and about parties. I have never been such a great party man myself, and the Senator will not find me criticizing the ``other side'' very often, or the ``Republicans'' very often. I can do that and have been known to do it, but there are other things more important, and the Senate is one of the other things that is more important. We are talking about the Senate. We are talking about the cornerstone of the Republic. As long as we have freedom to debate in the Senate and freedom to amend, the people's liberties will be secured. I thank the Senator.

   Mr. BYRD. The Senator is precisely correct. The system is not operating as it was intended to operate. We are improvising it as we go along. We are changing it all the time. The Senate is changing. And I regret to say that. 
   I simply want to thank the Senator for using the charts. They are very persuasive. They tell the story. They tell it concisely. 
   I also thank the Senator for standing up for the Senate and the true system. The Appropriations Committee was created in 1867. So for 133 years we have had this system. The Appropriations Committee was very small in the beginning. I think it was made up of only five members. 
   The system is being changed by Senators who have come here, most of them, from the other body. They don't know how the Senate is supposed to work. They never saw it operate under the rules. It is being run mostly by unanimous consent now, not by the rules. For example, we never have calendar Mondays here anymore. We ought to try that just once in a while to keep the system--the real system--alive. 
   I thank the Senator for his timely comments.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am constrained to say, as I have said before, that the fault is not all on one side. And I have complained about this to my own caucus. Too many times, on this side of the aisle, we have called up the same old amendment over and over and over again. I have said this in my own caucus, and I have said this before to my colleagues. So we are at fault to an extent in that regard. That is not to say a Senator does not have the right to call up an amendment. He has the right to call up his amendment as many times as he wishes. But I see no point in beating a dead horse over and over and over. That is something I think we, on our own side, should talk about and try to avoid. 
   Now, there are occasions when, for one reason or another, perhaps a Senator is absent or a supporter of a given amendment may be away for a funeral or something else, and the amendment may be called up, and it loses. Then I think there is real justification for calling up that amendment again on a future date. 
   But there are times here when it seems to me my own side is only interested in sending a ``message.'' We want to send ``messages.'' This is alright up to a point. I have kind of grown tired of just sending ``messages.'' 
   For example, nobody has supported campaign financing longer than I have in this Senate. As a matter of fact, I offered a campaign financing bill with former Senator David Boren in this Senate in the 100th Congress. Now, I offered cloture on that bill eight times. No other majority leader has ever offered cloture on the same bill eight times. But I was disappointed eight times because only four or five Members of the Republican Party ever joined the Democrats in supporting that campaign financing bill. So we tried and we tried again. 
   I think we send too many ``messages'' on this side of the aisle. I can understand the majority leader, in trying to avoid this repetition of having to vote on the same old amendment--and they are political amendments--has attempted to bypass the Senate by not calling up bills. 
   Many authorization bills--if one will take a look at this calendar, look at the bills on this calendar. If the Senator will look at the bills on this calendar, we have a calendar that is 71 pages in length. Some of those probably are authorization bills. They are not called up. So, Senators all too often only have appropriations bills to use as vehicles for amendments which they otherwise would call up if the authorization bills were on the calendar and were called up. 
   The authorizing committees need to do their work. They need to get the bills out on the calendars. And then, when the bills are on the calendar, if they are not called up, Senators are going to resort to calling up amendments on appropriations bills. So there is enough fault and enough blame here to go around. 
   But I think the greatest danger of all is for the Senate to be relegated to a position in which it cannot be effective in carrying out the intentions of the framers. And that can best be done by not calling up appropriations bills, sending them directly to conference, and preventing Senators from carrying out the wishes of their constituents, by not allowing Senators to debate and call up amendments. 
   I thank the distinguished Senator. He has taken the floor on several occasions to mention this and to call our attention to it. I thank him.

   Mr. BYRD. Speaking of the old days, I sat in that presiding chair up there on one occasion 22 hours. I sat there 22 hours, through a night of debate on civil rights legislation, when I first came here. It fell to my lot to have that as a chore, as it falls to the lot of newer Senators. I sat there 22 hours. 
   I can remember the civil rights debate of 1964. I hope my memory is not playing tricks on me. One hundred sixteen days elapsed between the day that Mr. Mansfield motioned up that bill and the day that we cast the final vote on that bill, 116 days. We were on the motion to proceed for 2 weeks. I believe the Senate spent 58 days, including 6 Saturdays and, it seems to me, 1 Sunday--the Parliamentarian will remember this--but 6 Saturdays, get me now, in debating the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
   I voted against the act. I was the only Northern Democrat who voted against it. I was the only northern Democrat who voted against cloture. And the only other Democrats who voted against cloture were Alan Bible of Nevada--and I am talking about Senators outside the South--and perhaps Senator Hayden of Arizona. We spent six Saturdays. We didn't go home on Saturdays. We stayed here and we voted. I forget how many rollcall votes we cast. Even following the cloture, we were on that bill, I believe, 10 days or so, on the bill even after cloture was invoked but we stayed here and did the work. 
   Had Everett Dirksen, the Republican leader, not voted for cloture and led some of the Senators on the other side to vote for cloture, had that Republican leader not worked with Mr. Mansfield and Hubert Humphrey in those  days to pass an important act, that act would not have passed. Cloture would never have been invoked on that act, if Everett Dirksen, the leader on the other side, and some of the Senators who went with him, had they not decided to vote for cloture and vote for the bill. That was teamwork. That was cooperation. That was stick-to-it-iveness. That was the 
   Senate at its best. 
   I spoke against that bill. I spoke 14 hours 13 minutes against that bill. If I had it to do over again, I would vote for it. But I was just out of law school. I thought I knew a lot about constitutional law. And there were some great constitutional lawyers here then. Sam Ervin was here, Lister Hill, John Sparkman, Richard Russell, Russell Long; these were men who had been in this chamber for a long time. They didn't come to the Senate in order to use it as a stepping stone in a lateral move to the Presidency. They came here to be Senators. But the Senate argued. It debated. It amended. It took whatever time was necessary, and the Senate spoke its will. That is what we don't have these days. We don't have that these days. 
   I thank the Senator for the service he is performing.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last week the Senate unanimously approved for ratification the International Labor Organization Convention 176 on mine safety and health. I thank the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, the distinguished Senator from North Carolina, for his committee's efforts in expeditiously approving this convention. I also thank the mining state senators from New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Montana, Kentucky, Nevada, Idaho, and my own West Virginia, who joined me in championing this convention. 
   Coal mining has long been recognized as one of the most dangerous occupations in the world. In the United States, the frequency and magnitude of coal mining disasters and intolerable working conditions in the 19th century created a public furor for mine health and safety laws. The Pennsylvania legislature was the first to pass significant mine safety legislation in 1870, which was later followed by the first federal mine safety law that was passed by Congress in 1891. Over the years, these state and federal laws were combined into what are today the most comprehensive mine safety and health standards in the world. Since the beginning of the 20th century, mine-related deaths have decreased from 3,242 deaths in 1907, the highest mining fatality rate ever recorded in the United States, to 80 deaths in 1998, the lowest mining fatality rate ever recorded in the United States. 
   These numbers stand in stark contrast to the recorded fatalities in other parts of the world. In China, for example, the government recently reported 2,730 mining fatalities in the first six months of this year. That is more than thirty times the number of fatalities recorded in the United States for all of 1999. And, this number does not even include metal and nonmetal mining fatalities in China. 
   Many countries in the world have national laws specific to mine safety and health. Yet, in most of these countries, the laws are often times inadequate. In many South American and Asian countries, national laws have not kept pace with the introduction of new mining equipment, such as long-wall mining machines and large surface mining equipment, which create new hazards for miners. Similarly, many of these countries do not require employers to inform miners of workplace hazards or allow for workers to refuse work because of dangerous conditions without fear of penalties. What is worse is that even if these countries do have adequate laws, in most cases, the inexperience and limited resources of their mine inspectors often means that egregious violations by foreign coal companies are never penalized, encouraging repeat violations. 
   As a result, miners in developing countries are exposed to risks and hazards that claim 
   up to 15,000 lives each year. Severe mine disasters involving large loss of life continue to occur throughout Europe, Africa and Asia. The most recent accident to gain worldwide attention occurred in Ukraine in March of this year, when 80 miners were killed after a methane gas explosion because of an improperly ventilated air shaft. 
   The United States competes against these countries with notoriously low mine safety standards in the global energy market. However, the disparity in mine safety and health standards with which foreign and domestic coal companies must comply, places U.S. coal companies at a disadvantage by allowing foreign coal companies to export coal at a cheaper cost. This has contributed to a decrease in U.S. coal exports in the global energy market. According to the Department of Energy, U.S. coal exports to Europe and Asia have decreased from 78 million tons to 63 million tons between 1998 and 1999. The Administration projects that U.S. coal exports will continue to decrease to approximately 58 million tons by 2020. This reduction in coal exports falls on an industry that is already experiencing a steady decrease in the number of active coal mining operations and employment in the United States. Faced with strong competition from other coal exporting countries and limited growth in import demand from Europe and Asia, the United States needs to level the playing field as much as possible with its foreign competitors, and should encourage foreign governments to adopt safety and health standards similar to those in the United States. 
   Accordingly, representatives from the National Mining Association, the United Mine Workers of America, and the Mine Safety and Health Administration helped to draft a treaty in 1995 that would establish minimum mine safety and health standards for the international community. This treaty was based on the federal mine safety and health laws in the United States. Convention 176 was adopted by the General Conference of the International Labor Organization in 1995, and would designate that a competent authority monitor and regulate safety and health in mines and require foreign coal companies to comply with national safety and health laws. It would also encourage cooperation between employers and employees to promote safety and health in mines. 
   By encouraging other countries to ratify Convention 176, the United States can increase the competitiveness of U.S. coal prices in the global market place, while, at the same time, increasing protections for miners in all parts of the world. In addition, the United States can build a new market for itself where it can provide training and superior mine safety equipment to nations struggling to increase their mine safety standards. 
   The United States prides itself on having the safest mines in the world, while, at the same time, remaining a competitive force in the global energy market. This convention embraces the belief that other countries would do well to follow the U.S. example. I support this convention, and applaud the Senate for its approval.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in commemoration of the signing of the Constitution and in recognition of the importance of active, responsible citizenship in preserving the Constitution's blessings for our Nation, the Congress, by joint resolution of August 2, 1956 (36 U.S.C. 159), requested that the President proclaim the week beginning September 17 and ending September 23 of each year as ``Constitution Week.'' That has happened each year since. 
   This week the United States celebrates one of its greatest achievements. Two-hundred and thirteen years ago, on September 17, 1787, the Founding Fathers placed their signatures on the newly created Constitution in Philadelphia's Independence Hall. Eleven years earlier, 6 of the 39 signers of the U.S. Constitution signed the Declaration of Independence in the same building in Philadelphia. Within the lifespan of a single generation, Americans had effectively declared their independence twice. 
   In many ways, the liberation claimed from Britain in 1776 was less remarkable than the historical achievement that Americans claimed by framing the Constitution in 1787. The Constitution represented a triumph of political imagination and pragmatism by recognizing that ultimate political authority resides not in the government, or in any single government official, but rather, in the people. 
   The Founding Fathers had used the doctrine of popular sovereignty as the rationale for their successful rebellion against English authority in 1776 when they framed the Declaration of Independence. They argued that the government's legitimacy remains dependent on the governed, who retain the inalienable right to alter or to abolish their government. The Declaration of Independence set forth their justifications for breaking with Britain, but, until September 17, 1787, they had not yet been able to work out fully how to implement principles of popular sovereignty, while, at the same time, preserving a stable government that protects the rights and liberties of all citizens. The Constitution is a mechanism for advancing the principles of the American Republic stated so eloquently in the Declaration of Independence. To paraphrase former Chief Justice Warren Burger, the Declaration is the promise, the Constitution is its fulfillment. 
   The new republican union created in 1776 was a truly unprecedented experiment, whose future was very much in doubt. Not only were the former British colonies unsure of whether they would be successful in their war for independence, but there was also doubt that the American colonials would be able to create a stable republican government, able to protect the rights and liberties of its citizens, without backsliding into the same authoritarian rule experienced under Britain. For this reason, it is appropriate that we take this moment, 213 years later, to reflect on a document that completed an uncertain process that was begun, from a documentary standpoint, on July 4, 1776. 
   I have spoken on several occasions about the taproots and the origins of the U.S. Constitution. Of course, the State constitutions, some of which had been in existence since early 1776, greatly influenced the framers. Many of the ideas in the State constitutions had already been tested under colonial experience, and as a matter of fact, under the British experience, and were later reborn in our national charter. The establishment of a national bicameral legislature finds its roots in at least 9 out of 13 State constitutions. 
   Of course, the roots extended prior to that but in at least 9 of the 13 State constitutions we find the enlargement of the roots, the fleshing out of the roots, the nourishing of the roots. 
   Lessons derived from recent political experiences were arguably as likely to influence the thinking of the founding  framers as the maxims and axioms of, among others, the English philosophers John Locke, Sir William Blackstone--one of the great legal authorities of all time--John Milton--that great author of ``Paradise Lost'' and ``Paradise Regained'', Algernon Sydney, and other great works--Scottish philosopher David Hume, and French philosopher Baron de Montesquieu, all of whom were part of the intellectual Enlightenment period. 
   Likewise, many of the institutional practices embedded in the U.S. Constitution hark back to England and its Constitution, which, although it is largely unwritten, does contain such written documents as the Magna Carta, the Petition of Right, and the English Bill of Rights. Many of the amendments incorporated into the U.S. Bill of Rights can be found, almost word for word, in those political documents. 
   But, to truly understand and appreciate the U.S. Constitution and the political movement that led to its creation, one must become familiar with the first national charter that was established by the newly independent colonies--namely, the Articles of Confederation. 
   Many Americans have heard of the Articles of Confederation, fewer Americans probably ever read those Articles of Confederation. 
   The operation of government under that national charter provided the most visible examples of what republicanism meant in practice. Its failure not only drove the movement for constitutional reform--when I say ``its failure,'' I mean the failure of the Articles of Confederation--not only drove the movement for constitutional reform that brought the framers to Philadelphia in 1787, but also brought experimental evidence--ah, how important was that experimental evidence--from which the framers drew in creating a greatly improved model of republican government. 
   From its inception, the first national charter--the Articles of Confederation--had limited goals. The Articles provided for what was essentially a continuation of the Second Continental Congress by creating a unicameral legislature, where each State was represented with one vote. This body had the authority to declare war, to conduct diplomacy, to regulate Indian affairs, to coin money, and to issue currency, among other things. However, to limit the threat of a centralized authority, Congress could not levy taxes or regulate trade. The crucial power of the purse rested solely with the States, which were to contribute funds at the request of the Congress. The Articles further limited centralized power by providing the States with total enforcement authority so that the Congress could do no more than to recommend policies to the States. 
   When it came to money, it could do no more than just request the funds from the States. The States, which then could accept or ignore these recommendations, most of the time failed to provide the funds. Many times the States would provide some of the funds but not all of the funds requested. 
   Looking back, the inherent weaknesses of the Articles seem obvious now, but all of these limitations on the Congress were designed with the specific intention of making the State legislatures the dominant force in the Government. This may seem peculiar to us today, but, at the time, loyalty to the State Governments rather than to the Nation underlaid the mentality of post-war America. We oftentimes forget that the Articles were drafted in 1777 in the midst of the Revolutionary War. At the time, delegates were more concerned about keeping up with the demands of the Continental army, and, perhaps more importantly, avoiding capture by the British army which had occupied New York City and Philadelphia in 1777 than in drafting a national charter. In fact, it was not until 1781--4 years later--that the Articles of Confederation had been ratified by the thirteen States. With the new Nation in the midst of a military crisis, Congress assumed correctly that the States would contribute funds and men to the common defense. From the Framers' perspective--the framers of the Articles of Confederation--the greatest problem in 1777 was curbing executive power. And that is still a problem today. What had driven the colonies into rebellion was an abuse of executive power by the king, his ministers, and his agents. To ensure that the executive could never again threaten the popular liberty, national government was made subservient to the States in order to preserve the sovereignty of the States. 
   What ultimately began to alter the American psyche can only be described as Congress' impotence in addressing incidents of unrest in the Nation. Efforts had been underway to amend the Articles even before they took effect on March 1, 1781. One week earlier, Congress had asked the States to approve an amendment authorizing it to collect a five percent tariff on imported goods. This amendment was the outgrowth of the economic condition of the country at the time. By 1781, American merchants found themselves deeply in debt after the British and French closed markets in the Caribbean to their trade, and Americans continued to import large amounts of luxury goods. At the same time, the Congress and States were printing paper money to finance their debts, which were backed only by their promise to redeem the bills with future tax receipts. By 1781, the currency had become worthless and led Americans to coin the expression, ``not worth a continental.'' The printing of paper money combined with a wartime shortage of goods led to an inflationary spiral of fewer and fewer goods costing more and more money. The goal of the amendment introduced in February 1781 was to tax imports, which would simultaneously reduce the demand for imports while forcing British and French merchants to open their Caribbean trade routes. The amendment would ultimately fail when Rhode Island refused to approve it. 
   Congress was faring no better in foreign diplomacy. In 1784, Spain closed New Orleans and the Mississippi river to American trade, preventing settlers living to the west of the Appalachian mountains from shipping their goods to the Gulf of Mexico, and thence to other markets. This action, coupled with the abortive separatist movements in Kentucky and Tennessee, threatened to divide the American Nation into two or three separate confederacies by forcing southwestern territories to accommodate themselves to Spain. In 1785, Congress instructed Secretary of Foreign Affairs John Jay to negotiate a treaty with Spain that would allow the southwestern States to navigate the Mississippi, and thus, ensure southwestern loyalty to the American Nation. The Spanish emissary, Don Diego de Gardoqui, however, proved to be the more formidable diplomat. He convinced Jay to sign a treaty by which the United States would relinquish all rights to the Mississippi for twenty-five years in return for Spain acknowledging U.S. territorial claims in the southwest. When the treaty became public knowledge, however, southwestern territories were outraged, further dividing the Nation. Congress attempted several times in the 1780s to give Congress greater authority to regulate both foreign and interstate commerce. The amendments, however, were never unanimously approved by the States. 
   In both of these matters of diplomacy and economics, Congress under the Articles of Confederation, found that its proposals would founder on the requirement of unanimous State ratification. This requirement led the supporters of a stronger national government to believe that such a policy could only be pursued through a limited, piecemeal approach. 
   The desultory history of all of the amendments that Congress had fruitlessly considered since 1781 suggested that more radical approaches stood little chance. However, by 1786, it became clear that the states stood little chance of ever unanimously agreeing to amendments. With Congress losing what little influence it had, it soon became clear to a group of Virginians that any reform efforts would have to first come from the states. 
   The most important effort toward reform therefore took place in Virginia in January 1786, when the state legislature approved a resolution calling for an interstate conference to consider vesting more power in the confederation Congress to regulate commerce. The Convention was to take place in Annapolis, Maryland, and, although only five states sent delegates to attend the Annapolis convention in September 1786, the delegates did agree to a second convention in Philadelphia ``......to devise such further provisions  as shall appear to them necessary to render the constitution of the federal government adequate to the exigencies of the union.'' The potential radical thrust of this proposal suggests that the gradual strategy of reform had collapsed, and that many of those present had turned to a desperate maneuver after having exhausted all other measures. Among those present were Hamilton and Madison. 
   Yet, up until the winter of 1786-1787, when the Shays' Rebellion took place, the Founding Fathers did not suggest that the Philadelphia convention should address anything other than the conspicuous failings of the Articles. 
   However, events in Massachusetts in the winter of 1786-1787 cast the problems of the nation in more comprehensible terms. Shays' Rebellion began as a protest by Massachusetts farmers laboring under heavy state taxation and private debt. Led by Daniel Shays, a veteran of the Revolution, an armed mob of two thousand men marched on the federal arsenal in Springfield, Massachusetts, and closed the county courts to halt creditors from foreclosing on any more farms. The State Militia quelled the uprising, but the news of the event left the rest of the country shaken. The Massachusetts state constitution was widely considered the most balanced of the revolutionary charters. If the Massachusetts state government could not protect the property of its citizens, one of the most fundamental aims of Republican government, how could the less balanced state and national governments endure if such unrest spread? 
   As Minister to France in 1787, Thomas Jefferson dismissed Shays' Rebellion. ``A little rebellion now and then is a good thing,'' he wrote James Madison on January 30, 1787, ``and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical.'' Madison was hardly inclined to agree. As he examined the ``vices of the political system of the United States'' in the early months of 1787, he became convinced that the agenda of the upcoming convention should not be limited to the failings of the Articles. The time had come to undo the damages caused by the excesses of republicanism. 
   But, consider for a moment the odds that were against the delegates in crafting a workable government. The record of reform was hardly encouraging. The states had taken more than three years to ratify the Articles, and in the six years since, not one amendment that Congress had proposed to the states had been approved. There was also the question of whether the Congress should endorse the Philadelphia convention. By 1787, its reputation had fallen so low that it was unclear whether its endorsement would aid or kill reform efforts. Moreover, the convention had to attract an impressive array of legal minds to lend validity to whatever document would be produced. Yet, there was little guarantee that the convention would muster such persons. Even George Washington, who among all others probably most recognized the need for the convention, was hesitant to attend for fear that his reputation would suffer if the convention should fail. He accepted the invitation reluctantly at the urging of Madison, and even then, not until the last minute. But, perhaps more importantly, the Articles never provided for such a device of amending the Confederation, which caused many in Congress to question the propriety of the convention. After all, if the conventional delegates did produce a revised document, would it be considered law if the Articles never allowed for a constitutional convention in the first place? 
   In the face of these obstacles, any proposal put forth by the Framers would have to be more complex than that of simply shifting the powers of taxation and regulation of commerce from the state governments to a national government. Because the state governments were already entrenched, it was unlikely that the states would agree to the creation of a powerful central government at the expense of their self-governing authority. Granting the states specific self-governing powers and rights was not only politically expedient, but also served the Framers' intent to limit the central government's authority. The sharing of power between the states and the national government was one more structural check in what was to be an elaborate governmental scheme of checks and balances. The Framers further decentralized authority through a separation of powers, which distributed the business of government among three separate branches. 
   This ensured against the creation of too strong a national government capable of overpowering the individual state governments. 
   In a seemingly paradoxical fashion, governmental powers and responsibilities were also intentionally shared among the separate branches. Congressional authority to enact laws can be checked by an executive veto, which in turn can be overridden by a two-thirds majority vote in both houses; the President serves as commander-in-chief, but only the Congress has the authority to raise and support an army, and to declare war; the President has the power to appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the United States, but only by and with the advice and consent of the Senate; and the Supreme Court has final authority to strike down both legislative and presidential acts as unconstitutional. This balancing of power is intended to ensure that no one branch grows too powerful and dominates the national government. 
   What happened in Philadelphia was then truly remarkable. Committed at first to limiting executive power by making state legislatures supreme, Americans created a constitution that provided for an independent executive branch and a balanced government. Committed at first to preserving the sovereignty of states, Americans drafted a constitution that established a national government with authority that was independent of the states. 
   So each of the two--the National Government and the State governments--was supreme in its own sphere and, yet, separate, in a sense, and overlapping. 
   Doubtful at first that a strong national republic was possible, Americans created a strong national republic that still endures. 
   ``The real wonder,'' James Madison wrote in Federalist Number 37, ``is that so many difficulties should have been surmounted, and surmounted with a unanimity almost as unprecedented as it must have been unexpected. It is impossible for any man of candor to reflect on this circumstance without partaking of the astonishment. It is impossible for the man of pious reflection not to perceive in it a finger of that Almighty hand which has been so frequently and signally extended to our relief in the critical stages of the revolution.'' 
   There is a story, often told, that upon exiting the Constitutional Convention Benjamin Franklin was approached by a group of citizens asking what sort of government the delegates had created. ``A republic, Madame,'' he answered, ``if you can keep it.'' Characteristic of Franklin's statements, we should not allow the brevity of his response to undervalue its essential meaning: it is not enough that democratic republics are founded on the consent of the people; they are also absolutely dependent upon the active and informed involvement of the people. 
   Yet, opinion polls show that Americans have either never read the Constitution or have forgotten most of what they learned about it in school. The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence are the common bonds that unite the nation because they articulate our political, moral, and spiritual values. To a degree Americans recognize the ideologies of liberty and freedom that are contained in these documents, but we should also recognize that these beliefs were shaped by the political climate in large part in which they occurred. Too often these ideals are used as catch phrases to describe the founding documents which can obscure the complex political processes that produced both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. The post-Revolutionary era provides Americans with perhaps the clearest examples of why the Constitution is so vital to the stability of the country and the protection of our most basic freedoms. It is critical that we reaffirm our knowledge of these events to preserve, in Madison's own words, ``..... that veneration which time bestows on everything, and without which perhaps the wisest and freest governments  would not possess the requisite stability.'' 
   Those words can be found in the Federalist No. 49, by James Madison. 
   In closing, let me refer back to something I said earlier when I said that it is not enough that democratic republics are founded on the consent of the people; they are absolutely dependent upon the active and informed involvement of the people. 
   In this regard, the American people will shortly be called upon to be involved. There is a national election coming. Elections will occur in every State. I think it is very appropriate, if I may, to state those words again. 
   It is not enough that democratic republics are founded on the consent of the people; they are also absolutely dependent upon the active and informed involvement of the people. 
   It is a disgrace, if we look at the record of the voter turnout in this country, the American people, it seems to me, are less and less involved when it comes to voting. Fewer and fewer of the people exercise this right--this duty. This is a foremost duty of American citizenship. Fewer people are involved. 
   I close with this reference to history. 
   In 1776, in September, George Washington asked for a volunteer to go behind the British lines and draw pictures and develop information with respect to the placement of the British guns, their breastworks, their fortifications, and to bring that information back to the American lines. A young man by the name of Nathan Hale responded to the call. He was a schoolteacher. He went behind the British lines. This was an exceedingly dangerous assignment. 
   Nathan Hale achieved his purpose, but on the night before he was to return to the American lines, he was discovered by the British to be an American spy. The papers, the drawings, were upon his person. The next morning, September 22, 1776--224 years ago today--he stood before the hastily built gallows. He saw just before him the crude wooden coffin in which his body would soon be laid. He asked for a Bible. The request was denied. Whether or not the British at that point had a Bible near, we don't know. But there he stood with his hands tied behind him. 
   The British commander, whose name was Cunningham, asked Hale if he had anything to say. His last words, which are remembered by every schoolchild in America who has had the opportunity to read American history, were these: I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country. 
   The British commander said: ``String the rebel up''. 
   Nathan Hale gave his one life for his country. 
   My final question is this: If Nathan Hale was willing to give his only life--all he had--for his country, why is every American, Republican or Democrat or Independent, not willing to give his one vote for his country? 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as the end of the 106th Congress is fast approaching, I am deeply dismayed about the prospects of completing action on the thirteen annual appropriations bills for Fiscal Year 2001, which begins October 1st. Unfortunately, as has happened far too often in recent years, much of the work on appropriations bills remains to be done. There is really no valid excuse for the Senate's failure to do its appropriations work. The House has done its work in a timely fashion. 
   Yet, to date, only two of the Fiscal Year 2001 appropriations bills have been signed into law--Military Construction and Defense. Of the remaining eleven bills, four have yet to even be brought up for debate in the full Senate. Those bills are Treasury, Commerce-Justice-State, VA-HUD, and The District of Columbia. As Members are aware, the conference report on H.R. 4516, the Fiscal Year 2001 Legislative Branch Appropriations is divided--broken into two divisions. Division A contains the conference agreement for the Legislative Branch bill. Division B, which was inserted into the Legislative Branch Bill without any input by Democratic Members of either the House or Senate, contains the entire Treasury-General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001. This was done despite the fact that the Senate has never taken up the Treasury-General Government Appropriations bill at all. In addition, again without any input from the Democratic Members of the House or Senate, a tax measure to repeal the telephone excise tax was inserted in this same conference report. The measure was soundly defeated in this body yesterday, as I believe it should have been. 
   Here we are with only nine calendar days left before the beginning of Fiscal Year 2001, and we have enacted only two of the thirteen annual appropriations bills and had them signed into law; two more were contained in the conference report on H.R. 4516, namely the Legislative Branch and Treasury-General Government bills. That leaves nine fiscal year 2001 appropriations bills remaining. Since, on yesterday, we did defeat the conference report, actually the Legislative Branch and Treasury-General Government bills have not been acted on, we have eleven bills remaining. 
   To conform with the Constitutionally envisioned process, all four of these bills should be passed in the Senate before being taken up in conferences with the other body. To shortcut that process means that the full Senate never has an opportunity to amend these bills or debate provisions in them. Especially when it comes to bills which spend the taxpayers' money, we ought to take the time to allow debate and amendment by the full membership of this body. I hear all of this talk about tax cuts and giving the people back their hard-earned money. How does that square with the rather cavalier attitude we sometimes exhibit here when it comes to appropriations bills? Do we forget, that when it comes to appropriations bills, we are spending the people's money? Don't Members of the Senate feel an obligation to let the full Senate scrutinize, debate, and, if necessary, amend, bills that allocate those hard-earned tax dollars? No public debate by the Senate on the billions of dollars contained in these bills for programs and projects means that the public is denied critical information about the use of the public's money. In a body formulated to foster debate and to protect the rights of the minority view, it is especially irresponsible to abdicate those functions when it comes to spending the people's tax dollars. 
   There is plenty of blame to go around as to why the Commerce-Justice-State, VA-HUD, and DC bills have not been brought up, as well as the Treasury bill. I do not seek to point the finger at anybody. 
   The chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the members of the Appropriations Committee have done their very best to work on these bills, to report them. The Commerce-Justice-State bill has been before the Senate long enough that we could have passed it, we could have stayed in on Fridays and, if need be, on some Saturdays. We have done that before, and we could have gotten that bill passed and, at the same time, let Senators have the chance to offer amendments to it. That is what the process is all about. 
   The leadership too often files cloture on appropriations bills and other matters, in order to limit the number of controversial and politically loaded amendments that can be offered by Senators on the minority side of the aisle. Democratic Members too often bring up ``message'' amendments over and over again on appropriations bills because they find little opportunity to have those matters debated by the Senate on other bills. 
   I have to say that the authorization committees, some of them at least, do not do their work and, as a consequence, the action and the responsibility then falls upon the Appropriations Committee. Members do not have an opportunity to offer amendments to authorization bills that ought to have been reported and brought to the floor. When those authorization committees do not act, naturally appropriations bills are the only vehicles to which Members can offer amendments that they would otherwise offer to the authorization bill. 
   Every action has a reaction. Polarization breeds polarization. Nevertheless, we must find a way to accommodate the needs of all Senators, as well as fulfill the responsibility of the leadership to move must-pass legislation. 
   This is not the first year that the regular appropriations process has broken down, but I urge us all to work on a bipartisan basis to ensure that it will be the last. Let us call a truce to the perennial warfare that we fight over these appropriations bills. Let us stop the drift that leads us to short cut the deliberative function of this Senate and all too often produces mammoth omnibus bills with everything but grandpa's false teeth thrown in. This  one grandpa who does not have false teeth. Mine would not go in. 
   Huge omnibus appropriations bills make a mockery of the legislative process, and sending appropriations bills direct to conference without Senate action on them also makes a mockery of the legislative process. For FY 1997, 1999, and 2000, Congress resorted to the adoption of omnibus appropriations acts which contained a number of appropriations bills, some of which had never been brought up in the Senate. Those omnibus acts also contained massive amounts of legislative matter, as well as tax cuts--legislative matter that never saw the light of day on the Senate floor. 
   For fiscal year 1999, the omnibus appropriations package enacted at the end of the session contained eight appropriations bills, as well as a tax bill totaling some $9.2 billion, and more than 60 major legislative proposals. Appropriations subcommittee chairmen and ranking members were not involved in a number of major decisions in their areas of jurisdiction, nor were the full committee chairmen and ranking members included in the decisions regarding the tax bill or the major legislative proposals. In all, that FY 1999 omnibus package totaled some 3,980 pages. It was wrapped together and run off on copy machines and presented to the two Houses as an unamendable conference report. That measure provided funding of nearly $500 billion and more than half of 3,980 pages contained legislative provisions. No one could possibly have known everything that was included in that omnibus monstrosity, just as no Member could have known what was in the omnibus bill for FY 1997, or for that of FY 2000. But we are headed in that direction again. 
   When we wait until the end of a session to take action on the overwhelming majority of appropriations bills, when we allow ourselves to be pressured by time, when we are forced to hurry because we are about to adjourn, it is an open invitation to the executive branch to sit down at the legislative table. 
   The Constitution vests the power of the purse in the legislative branch. That is the House and Senate. That is where the Constitution vests the power of the purse. Yet the way we are acting, the way we delay and the results that come from such delay in the end constitute an open invitation for the executive branch to come to the tables. 
   In that environment, most Senators are not in the room when the decisions are made. The President's men and the President's priorities carry great weight. It is late. The President's signature is needed, so the White House has the trump hand. Having squandered the whole year on meaningless posturing and bickering back and forth-- 
   I say back and forth. That means both sides. I do not stand here and accuse either side of having a monopoly on the bickering. We are all involved. But we are much more likely to yield to the administration's every demand then to complete our work. 
   I am hopeful we can avoid such a process for fiscal year 2001. I am encouraged by the fact that a number of conferences are either under way or soon will begin. I was in one yesterday afternoon, last evening, and this morning. 
   I urge the leadership to find a way to bring up the appropriations bills which have not seen Senate action for debate and amendment in the Senate. I think it would be useful for both leaders, if I might presume to make a suggestion, to appoint a group of Senators to discuss these remaining appropriations bills, and what amendments our colleagues deem most important to be offered. Let us reach out across our respective aisles and find a way to do our business without resorting to an always contentious, usually counterproductive, lame-duck session. That would be the responsible way to do business. That is the fair way to do business. That would be the right way to conduct the people's affairs. 
   The American public is disenchanted with politics as usual and with the constant warfare that seems to continually be waged in Washington. We must recommit ourselves to working together in the spirit of cooperation to ensure that we find a way to fulfill our duties and our oaths of office as U.S. Senators. 
   Nobody looks good in this annual mad dash to complete work on spending bills that should have been done months before. There are no winners here. 
   The Republicans don't win; the Democrats don't win. The people lose. The result is an institutional erosion that we see going on. The Senate is losing its powers, it is losing its prerogatives, they are being taken from us, when we do not let bills come up and be debated and be amended by Senators. There are no winners. 
   There are no gold, silver, or even bronze medalists. When we engage in this sloppy, annual relay race to get the job done at all costs, the baton always gets dropped, and the losers, once again, are the people we represent and the trust they have in us. 
   The Senate--the institution, the one place in which the people's interests can be debated at length, and where bills can be amended, and where a check can be made on the House of Representatives, as the framers intended, and where a check can be exercised against an overreaching executive branch, when that is short circuited--the Senate loses its powers, its prerogatives go by the wayside, and the interests, the freedoms, and the liberties of the American people suffer. 
   It is time that we talk about these things. I am the ranking member on the Appropriations Committee. I am very, very, very concerned. I was up at 3 o'clock this morning working on a speech, not this one, but one that I still intend to make about this very subject. 
   Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire for his consideration and courtesy in allowing me to go forward. I hope I have not kept him waiting unduly.

   Mr. BYRD. I thank the Democratic whip. I know he is willing to do just what he says. He wants to cooperate. 
   We have to save this institution. There are Senators in this body who have never seen the institution work as it was meant to work. I will have more to say about that later. But there are Members in this institution who think that this is the way the Senate has always worked. It is not. And I am not pointing fingers at anybody. I like both leaders. But we have to do something. We just must avoid coming back after the election. That is a disservice to the Members of the other body. They have done their work on these appropriations bills and sent them over here. Now we ought to do ours. And it is a disservice to the American people.

   Mr. BYRD. Yes. We have a duty. We have a responsibility. 
   Now, I have been leader. I have been the majority leader, 
   and I have been the minority leader, and I have been the majority leader again. I know what the problems and the pressures and the travails and the tribulations are of a majority leader. And I know what the  tribulations and trials of a minority leader are. So I am well acquainted with their problems. I have had them all. I have been there. My footprints are still there. It isn't the quality of our life--that the people send us here for. It is the quality of our work on behalf of the people who send us here. 
   I had bed check votes at 10 o'clock on Monday mornings. There are people who sit at the desk in front of me and there are some few Senators still in this body who will remember that: Bed check votes at 10 o'clock on Monday mornings. But I alerted my colleagues: That is what we are going to have. And we are going to have votes on Fridays. We are not quitting at 12. Now, in return for that, we are going to work 3 weeks, and then we are going to be out 1 week. So you can go home and see your constituents and get an understanding of what their needs are. But 3 weeks we are going to be here. You are off 1 week. We are going to be here 3 weeks. 
   And they loved it. Senators loved it. They knew I meant business. And I took the attitude: If you don't like me as leader--you voted me in--then you can vote me out. But as long as I am leader, I am going to lead. I may not have many who will follow me, but I will do what I think is right for this institution. 
   Well, my speech did not go over well with a few, but take a look at the record of that 100th Congress. That was a great Congress. That is the way we worked it. 
   I understand--as I say, I like both of our leaders. I personally have great admiration for Mr. LOTT and for Mr. DASCHLE. They have their problems. And we have to help them. But let's draw back here and think of the institution. The most important thing in the world is not for me to be reelected. That is not the most important. The most important thing is for me to do my duty to this Senate--to the Senate, to the Constitution, and to the people who send me here. And if it means I have to work early and late, so be it. 
   I thank the distinguished Senator, and thank the Senator from New Hampshire again.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I believe that the Senate is about to make a grave mistake. It is hard for me to believe that after a year which has seen the Chinese Government rattling sabers at Taiwan, continuing to brutally repress religion, and, generally, behaving like the ``Bobby Knight'' of the international community--after a year like that--the Senate is still determined to hand the Chinese a huge early Christmas present called permanent normal trade relations. We are running a $70 billion deficit with China. China's string of broken promises on trade and nonproliferation matters is longer than the Great Wall of China. Yet, a majority in this Senate has agreed to put all of its eggs into one basket and rush to pass PNTR. ``Don't worry. Be happy,'' says the administration. We have the bilateral trade and investment pact to protect us. 
   The bilateral trade and investment pact negotiated between the U.S. Trade Representative and China is one of a series of agreements which China is negotiating with members of WTO in order to join the body. The agreement has been used to assuage the many concerns of some Members of this body about granting PNTR to China. But I believe that PNTR and the new U.S.-China trade pact, that panacea of all good things, will encourage mainly one phenomenon--one phenomenon; namely, more U.S. corporations will move operations to China to capitalize on low-wage production for export back here to the United States. 
   Now if Senators don't believe it, just look at recent history. Look at NAFTA. Clear evidence is right there--NAFTA, the Holy Grail of NAFTA. The North American Free Trade Agreement was supposed to right every wrong, cure every evil, and make us all healthy, wealthy and wise. NAFTA's proponents convinced Congress in 1993 that NAFTA meant large net benefits to the U.S. economy, and nothing more. There were no down sides. The line went that the U.S. could only gain from expanded trade with Mexico because Mexico was reducing its trade barriers more than the United States. Moreover--and this will sound very familiar--proponents were positive that reducing trade barriers with Mexico would encourage ``reform'' politicians in Mexico to privatize the economy. Now, where have we heard that before? 
   A new, vast middle-class would emerge, creating a new, vast middle class market in Mexico, just waiting with baited breath to gobble up American-made goods. The Clinton administration confidently predicted a giant boom in U.S.-made autos sold to Mexico. 
   Well, my fellow Senators, what happened when we found the Holy Grail called NAFTA? Exactly the opposite happened, that's what. A 180-degree turn happened. NAFTA encouraged large U.S. investors to move production and capital and jobs south of 
   the border to exploit cheap labor and lax environmental standards. These new factories then exported their products back to the United States. By 1999, the United States was running a trade deficit with Mexico of $23 billion. 
   Automobiles were major contributors to the deficit. So were auto parts, computers, televisions, and telecommunications equipment. What happened to the large new Mexican middle class, salivating to buy American goods, which NAFTA was supposed to create? Instead of raising living standards in Mexico, NAFTA reinforced ``reform'' government policies in Mexico that reduced real wages for workers by 25 percent and increased to 38 percent the share of the Mexican population subsisting on $2.80 a day. 
   Does all this sound familiar, I ask my colleagues? It should. It certainly should. Once again the administration is playing that same old tune to Congress and to the American people. The administration argues that U.S. exports to China will rise because tariffs will be lowered on goods like automobiles and auto parts. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? 
   Additionally, unlike the Japanese yen or the Euro, or the Mexican peso, the exchange value of the Chinese currency does not float in the international market. It is largely determined by the Chinese Government, itself. In 1994, the Chinese devalued their currency in order to expand their exports and reduce their imports. Nothing in the bilateral agreement we have negotiated with China prevents the Chinese from such manipulation again. 
   In 1992, the Chinese and U.S. Governments signed a memorandum of understanding in which China agreed to provide access to U.S. goods in its markets, and to enforce U.S. intellectual property rights. President George Bush hailed this agreement as a breakthrough. The USTR under President Bush claimed that the 1992 agreement would provide ``American businesses, farmers, and workers with unprecedented access to a rapidly growing Chinese market with 1.2 billion people.'' Well, since that much-touted 1992 agreement, U.S. exports to China have risen by about $7 billion. But look at this. Imports from China to the United States have risen by $56 billion. Now, who won that round? 
   Yet, the Clinton administration continues to claim that this new agreement will ensure the political triumph of democracy-loving, U.S.-friendly, free-market leaders in China, who can be trusted to live up to their end of the bargain. Someone downtown must be popping ``gullible'' pills. That claim gives new meaning to the word ``naive''. 
   China's successful growth and modernization absolutely depend upon its ability to export to foreign markets in order to earn the hard currency needed to import new technology. 
   China is currently running a $70 billion annual trade surplus with Uncle Sam, with the United States. But China is running a trade deficit with the other major hard currency blocs--the European Monetary Union and Japan--a trend that will continue into the foreseeable future. In order to pursue its own self-interests, China has to exploit the U.S. market to the maximum. 
   Given this agenda, in a totalitarian state, one can be sure that the full force of the power of that state will be focused on protecting its manufacturing, technological, and agricultural markets. No faction of Chinese leaders can possibly deliver a more open economy to the United States or to the WTO. It is fool's gold to make that claim--fool's gold. It is the economic and political reality of the Chinese situation and agenda that makes it all but certain that China will violate any trade agreement, if it serves the national interests of China to do so. 
   We have not yet in this Senate or in this Nation or in this administration come to grips with that fundamental reality. It will not be different this  time. It will not be any different this time. The Chinese behave the way they do in matters of trade because they have to, to survive. They cannot and will not change. The Chinese Government is not some eager puppy, like my little dog Billy Byrd, panting to please the United States or anybody else. The Chinese are committed to their own goals and their own interests and they will do whatever it takes to further their agenda. 
   The Clinton administration claims that China has agreed in the bilateral trade agreement to eliminate health-related barriers to U.S. meat imports that were not based on scientific evidence. But, let's listen to the words of Chinese trade negotiator, Long Yongtu. Let's hear what he said:  
   Diplomatic negotiations involve finding new expressions. If you find a new expression, this means you have achieved a diplomatic result. In terms of meat imports, we have not actually made any material concessions. 
   And there is even more interesting commentary from China's chief negotiator, Long Yongtu, in an article he authored on the impacts of WTO entry, as reported by the BBC. On the issue of a Chinese compromise with the United States on the import of U.S. meat products he said, ``. . . in the United States people there think that China has opened its door wide for the import of meat. In fact, this is only a theoretical market opportunity. During diplomatic negotiations, it is imperative to use beautiful words--for this will lead to success.'' 
   We need to take note of the words of these Chinese officials. We need to listen more carefully. Beautiful words do not mean promises kept. Sometimes when we in the United States hear ``yes'' the Chinese are only saying ``maybe.'' 
   The USTR asserts that ``China will establish large and increasing tariff-rate quotas for 
   wheat--with a substantial share reserved for private trade.'' Yet again, Chinese negotiator Long Yongtu sees it differently. He has publicly stated that, although Beijing had agreed, on paper, to allow 7.3 million tons of wheat from the United States to be exported to the China mainland each year, it is a ``complete misunderstanding'' to expect this grain to actually enter the country. The Chinese negotiator said that in its agreement with the United States, Beijing only conceded ``a theoretical opportunity for the export of grain from the United States.'' We are suckers. 
   And yet, in the face of all of this contradiction by the Chinese, the Clinton Administration actually expects us all to believe that the bilateral agreement, PNTR and the WTO will magically force the Chinese government to shred its own national agenda, disregard its own needs and interests, even risk its own viability, in order to live up to an agreement with the United States. How naive can we be? 
   If anyone actually believes that, then let me introduce you to the tooth fairy; Tinkerbell; Mr. Ed, the talking horse; Snow White; the seven dwarfs; and Harvey, the invisible six foot rabbit. 
   This Senate and the administration--by all means, this administration--should pay a little more attention to history. 
   Let us look again for a moment at the history of NAFTA. From the time of the North America Free Trade Agreement took effect in 1994 through 1998, the net export deficit with Mexico and Canada has grown. Over 440,000 American jobs have been destroyed as a result of this growth. 
   Although gross U.S. exports to Mexico and Canada have shown a dramatic increase--with real growth of 92.1 percent with Mexico and 56.9 percent to Canada, that is only half the picture. Let us turn the corner. It is like knowing only one team's score or looking at only one side of the coin. We have to look at the other side of the coin to know who is winning; namely, what are we importing from Mexico? 
   The increases in U.S. exports have been overwhelmed by what we import from Mexico. Those imports have shot up 139.3 percent from Mexico and 58.8 percent from Canada. In 1993, before NAFTA was in effect, we had a net export deficit with our NAFTA partners of $18.2 billion. From 1993 to 1998 that same net deficit increased by 160 percent to $47.3 billion, resulting in job losses to American workers The first year NAFTA took effect, foreign direct investment in Mexico increased by 150 percent. Foreign direct investment in Canada has more than doubled since 1993. 
   Those are American workers' jobs that are flying like geese--we have heard the wild geese flit across the sky on their way south--across the borders. Factories 
   move over the border to take advantage of cheap labor costs, and they take good-paying American jobs with them. 
   But, Senator BYRD, you may say, unemployment in the United States is at 4.1 percent. Our people have jobs. Our unemployment is very low. The answer to that question lies in a closer scrutiny of the composition of U.S. employment. Good paying jobs with good benefits, largely in the manufacturing sector, are leaving our shores and being replaced by low skill, low wage jobs in the services sector. There is a hidden agenda that becomes apparent if one remembers the lessons of NAFTA and then ponders PNTR with China. You heard them say at the convention: You ain't seen nothing yet? Well, you ain't see nothing yet. Against that backdrop, it becomes more than clear where we are headed. We have been here before. 
   The objective for U.S. business is not access to the Chinese domestic consumer market. Forget it. They cannot afford our goods. The objective is the business-friendly, pollution-friendly climate in China, which is advantageous for moving production off U.S. shores and then selling goods, now made in China, back to the United States--selling goods made by American manufacturers that move overseas back to the United States. 
   Are we really going to expect anything different from a deal with the Chinese? Our trade deficit reached $340 billion in 1999. China accounts for 20 percent of the total U.S. trade deficit. A U.S. International Trade Commission report stresses that China's WTO entry would significantly increase investment by U.S. multinationals inside China. Additionally, the composition of Chinese imports has changed over the last 10 years. In 1989, only 30 percent of what we imported from China competed with our high-wage, high-skilled industries here in the U.S. By 1999, that percentage had risen to 50 percent. 
   The unvarnished, unmitigated, ungussied up truth is that American companies are eagerly eyeing China as an important production base for high-tech products. And these made-in-China goods are displacing goods made in the good ole USA, Additionally, most U.S. manufacturing in China is produced in conjunction with Chinese government agencies and state-owned companies. So much for the claim that U.S. corporate activity in China benefits Chinese entrepreneurs, and will lead to privatization and, lo and behold, the emergence of a democratic China. Get it? The emergence of a democratic China. 
   If all this were not enough, a Senate report, made public last week, charged the Chinese government with consistently failing ``to adhere to its nonproliferation commitments.'' In addition to outlining numerous instances of Chinese weapons sales to Iran, Libya, and North Korea, the report states, ``In many instances, Beijing merely mouths promises as a means of evading sanctions.'' 
   Yet Senator THOMPSON only got 32 votes in favor of his amendment, which would have given the Congress a role in monitoring China's proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
   Senators, I could go on and on and on, but I believe there is more than ample evidence that to grant PNTR to China at this time is very unwise. The signal we send by granting PNTR now is a signal of abject weakness. It is a signal of greed. It is a signal of ambivalence on the issue of nonproliferation. It is a signal of total disregard for the overwhelming evidence that the Chinese Government will not keep its word. 
   I fear that the benefits claimed to be derived from PNTR are really only PR from the White House. They are selling us soap and we are lathering up. We are risking a lot on the unfulfilled promises contained in the so-called bilateral trade agreement with China. Of course, the price for that deal was the administration's commitment to China that they could get PNTR through the Congress this year. It is a package deal--a  nice little wagonload of a Chinese signature on the bilateral trade agreement and an unencumbered PNTR present from the Congress. The only problem is that the wagon might be riding on Firestone tires. Shouldn't we Senators use a little caution and put off climbing in that wagon? I am not getting on that wagon. Wouldn't it be more prudent to stay off that wagon? Wouldn't that be the right choice for our Nation's people, the right thing for our national security? 
   This legislation--PNTR--can wait and it ought to wait. As far as this Senator's vote is concerned, it will wait. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. The Senator mentioned my name. That is why I am asking him to yield. 
   I appreciate the fact that he has given us his viewpoint. My remarks were largely based on research that has been done by the Economic Policy Institute. It is dated November 1999. I am reading from a paper issued by the institute. It is headed with these words:  
   NAFTA's pain deepens. Job destruction accelerates from 1999 with losses in every State.  
   It shows Colorado as having a net NAFTA job loss of 3,625 jobs. It doesn't show as much for West Virginia as Colorado. West Virginia has a net NAFTA loss of 1,183 jobs. 
   Let me say this to the Senator. I have been in Congress now 48 years. I have seen Democratic administrations, and I have seen Republican administrations. The kind of talk we just heard from this Senator--I respect him as a colleague, but I have to say this--is the same kind of talk I have been hearing from these administrations for 48 years. That is State Department talk. It is the same old State Department talk. 
   I will say to this Senator, we are going to get taken to the cleaners. We have been taken to the cleaners all these 48 years by other countries. In these ventured agreements, our negotiators for some reason or other always come out second. We have been taken to the cleaners. We will be taken again. 
   The Senator stated his opinion. That is this Senator's opinion, and it is based on 48 years of hearing this same line that emanates from----

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will speak briefly on my amendment. Then I will yield back the remainder of my time. I want to get to a markup of an appropriations bill by the Subcommittee on VA, HUD and Independent Agencies, of which I am a member. 
   In simple language, my amendment adds surety for American firms and American workers who are caught up in the confusing process of seeking relief from a surge of unfair imports. The process of getting the U.S. Government to agree with a firm's firsthand judgement that a flood of unfairly dumped imports is undercutting a U.S. manufacturer is complex and time consuming. Language in the House-passed bill is an improvement, but it leaves a serious loophole. The House language provides deadlines for the government and the President to agree or disagree that relief is needed, but if the President fails to meet his deadline for a decision, nothing happens. No relief can be forthcoming until the President acts. And the President might be under other pressures, from the State Department, for instance, warning that an affirmative Presidential decision might upset some other, unrelated negotiation. The State Department is not charged with worrying about the fate of individual U.S. firms. The State Department is not charged with worrying about the fate of steel companies, for example. 
   But for a firm hanging on by its fingernails, unable to pay its bills or secure needed financing, and for workers unsure when their lay-offs might end and their bills get paid, this uncertainty can be catastrophic. So the Byrd amendment says that if the President fails to act by the appointed deadline, the decision of the ITC will be implemented as though the President had agreed. So firms and workers will know on what date certain they will get their answer. The steel companies will know when they will get their answer. Coal miners will know, because they are affected by steel imports as well. That is what my amendment does. And for those affected firms, and those workers, that is pretty important. They need to know, and their bankers and creditors need to know. They need to be able to plan, and no other concerns should come before them, in my opinion. I've seen too many families suffering when the plant shuts down, too many towns hollowing out and falling into disrepair when people just give up. We need to give our citizens, our firms, an efficient and sure process to seek relief and to get relief when it is warranted. 
   This is our chance. This is our chance to strike a blow for the steel industry, which is a very important industry in the State represented by the current Presiding Officer. It is a very important industry in my State, exceedingly important. Now is the time to strike a blow for freedom, for the freedom of those men and women who work in these industries, freedom to know when relief is coming. They should not have to wait until a President seeks his own convenient moment. They should know the date. And when that date comes, it should happen. Let's make it happen by my amendment. 
   I yield back my time and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Senator FRED THOMPSON and Senator TORRICELLI. They are speaking the people's language. They are talking plain, commonsense. They are right in offering this amendment. 
   Senator THOMPSON is asking that we in this Senate pay attention to the national security concerns of this Nation, asking that we put national security ahead of greed. What is wrong with that? He is asking that we put the national security of the United States of America ahead of election-year politics. 
   What is the matter with this Senate? Can we not see the handwriting on the wall? 
   The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction--nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles, chemical weapons, biological weapons--is a growing menace to world stability. Can we not see that? The acquisition of nuclear weapons by such rogue nations as North Korea, Iran, and Iraq is the driving force behind the costly and complicated effort by the United States to deploy a national missile defense system. Can we not see that? 
   The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is forcing the nations of the world, including the United States, to reevaluate their own national security and to confront once again the nightmarish possibility of nuclear war. Can we not see that? 
   The main perpetrators behind the spread of weapons of mass destruction are China, Russia, and North Korea. According to the Central Intelligence Agency, in a report to Congress released last month, this unholy trinity of proliferators were the key contributors to the pipeline of ballistic missile related supplies and assistance going into the Middle East, South Asia, and North Africa. 
   It seems ludicrous to me that we would even consider standing here and debating the merits of extending Permanent Normal Trade Relations status  to the People's Republic of China without addressing the issue of China's leading role in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The Thompson-Torricelli amendment, of which I am a cosponsor, is essential to tightening our scrutiny of and control over the illegitimate trafficking in weapons of mass destruction by Chinese entities. 
   What weak dishwater is the excuse that we cannot add anything to the House-passed bill that would force a conference that might make some members of the House uncomfortable. What a sorry spectacle is a Senate completely cowed by the possibility that we might upset the Chinese if we add this provision. 
   What a travesty that the Secretary of Defense is reported to be calling 
   Senators to oppose an amendment that puts the Chinese on notice about their egregious actions regarding the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction--weapons that threaten the safety of the planet. 
   I care nothing about a President's legacy if this is the price. I care nothing about profits for multinational companies if this is the price. 
   I took an oath to defend the Constitution of the Unites States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and so did every other member of this body. Are we to tear up that oath for the election-year politics and greed? 
   Do we think that the American people are watching this debate with pride today? Do we think the American people are willing to auction off this Nation's security interests for the low bid of a Chinese promise to reduce tariffs? 
   China's string of broken promises is longer than its Great Wall. 
   We are talking here about the wanton export of nuclear weapons, of chemical weapons, of biological weapons and of long-range missiles. And what do we hear as a defense against addressing such dangerous and diabolical behavior? We hear the tepid, water-logged response that such action we might take would endanger passage of this trade bill. 
   I have been in legislative bodies for 54 years, Mr. President. This is the first time I have ever seen anything such as this. When I was in the House of Delegates in West Virginia, I objected to being bound by a caucus, and I have never yet intended to be bound by any cabal or any commitment that, regardless of what the merits may be on a given amendment, we will vote against it. I have never seen that happen. I have never been one to believe in that approach. 
   I say to my friend from South Carolina, Senator HOLLINGS, the world's greatest deliberative body is quaking and wringing its hands over an amendment that would send a shot over the bow of the rogue elephant behavior of the Chinese. 
   We tremble at the thought of Chinese displeasure. Our lips quiver at the thought of displeasing big business or the president of the Chamber of Commerce or Cabinet members of the Clinton administration or the President himself as they dial for dollars and for votes. Those of us who refuse to roll over like good dogs just don't get it. We know that the fix is in on this fight, but we just keep slugging anyway. Maybe we will land a good punch or two if we fight on. Maybe the powers that be in China will notice there were some in the Senate who refused to legitimize China's outrageous disregard for the safety of the world by handing them the trophy of PNTR. Thank God for the likes of Senator PAUL WELLSTONE, Senator FRED THOMPSON, Senator FRITZ HOLLINGS, and Senator BOB TORRICELLI, and the 33 brave souls--33 brave souls, I want you to know--who dared to vote with me on a couple of modest amendments to this ill-advised trade bill. I thank them. 
   I believe the American people know what we are trying to do, and I believe they will put patriotism over pandering for profit any day. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD an item from the New York Times titled ``Wavering Senators Feeling Pressure on China Trade Bill.'' I will have more to say about that later.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I will be direct and to the point. This amendment requires the U.S. Trade Representative, acting through the Working Party on the Accession of China to the World Trade Organization, to obtain a commitment from China to disclose information about state-owned enterprises that export products and government assistance given to those state-owned enterprises. My amendment also requests a timetable for China's compliance with WTO subsidy obligations. 
   Even the staunchest supporters of permanent normal trade relations with China recognize that U.S. trade with China will continue to be an uphill battle insofar as fairness is concerned. The administration acknowledges this fact, and my good friend Senator ROTH stated the same only yesterday. 
   There are profound implications to Sino-American relations as a result of granting PNTR to China. State-owned enterprises continue to be the most significant source of employment in most areas in China, and some reports suggest that these subsidized enterprises account for as much as 65 percent of the jobs in many areas of China. 
   Government control reigns supreme in China. My amendment sends a message that the U.S. Senate seeks transparency in China's likely accession to the World Trade Organization, WTO. My amendment places Members on record as demanding China's compliance with the promises that China has made under the bilateral trade agreement that it signed with the United States. 
   Opponents of my amendment state that the amendment is redundant and flawed on two bases. First, it was argued that the administration is already required to condition the extension of permanent normal trade relations with the People's Republic of China on a finding that China's state-owned enterprises are not disruptive to our trading interests. 
   With all due respect to my colleagues, with this bit of news that the subsidy issue rests on some administrative conclusion, I began immediately working double time to get this amendment passed. This news sounded the alarm. I think it would be better to have the information direct, and to make our own conclusions. The Senate has that latitude! 
   In addition, if the President already has information to certify that China's state-owned enterprises are not disruptive to our trading interests, my amendment should present no problem. Let Members see the raw statistics. Let Members of Congress make up their own minds. 
   What is the Administration trying to hide? I will have more confidence in what the administration says if I can review the material myself, and if Congress can review it. 
   I have the same limited confidence in the proposed administrative review team that is supposed to keep an eye on China, which, as opponents of my amendment mentioned, the specifics on how this review team will operate has not yet been determined. Are Senators willing to leave this matter to fate? 
   The opponents of my amendment also mentioned, and it is true, that China signed a bilateral agreement with the United States that proclaims that China will cease the use of subsidies prohibited under the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement), including those subsidies contingent upon export performance and subsidies contingent upon the use of domestic over imported goods, which are strictly prohibited under the SCM agreement. The WTO subsidy agreements do, indeed, state that many subsidies are prohibited and shall not be allowed. I'm all for that! 
   Why should we not know this information? Help me find out by voting in support of this amendment! Help me provide the U.S. steel industry, and other industries, with an assurance--based on more than a nod from the administration--that there are no illegal Chinese subsidies. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this amendment seeks to improve the certainty of the implementation of import relief in cases of affirmative determinations by the International Trade Commission with respect to market disruption to domestic producers of like or directly competitive products. The amendment is simple and straightforward and it may be vital to many U.S. industries, such as steel, footwear, and apples. It certainly causes no harm. 
   U.S. trade law provides for import relief authorities under sections 201, 202, 203, and 204 of the Trade Act of 1974, and relief from market disruption by imports from Communist countries, such as China, under section 406 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended. These safeguard actions are intended to provide temporary import relief from serious injury to domestic producers. These provisions are essential in order to provide U.S. manufacturers or farmers with an opportunity to address sudden waves of imports--such as those brought on by economic crises in foreign markets, and under other unexpected conditions beyond domestic control. 
   Regrettably, however, the import relief procedures are widely recognized as overly complicated and generally ineffective. Import relief authorities require exhaustive investigations and must meet tough litmus tests. Remedies granted under these authorities are so difficult to achieve that only a handful of the most egregious cases ever receive an affirmative verdict. The number of cases that have received relief under the import relief provisions speak for themselves: In the last five years, only six Section 201 cases resulted in some form of remedy out of 21 cases filed. 
   Market disruption caused by imports from a communist country, such as China, is even more complicated. Traditional remedies for import surges and unfair trade practices, such as Section 201 and the antidumping and countervailing duty laws, are inadequate to deal with a sudden and massive influx of imports that can be manipulated by government control of state-owned enterprises, including pricing and distribution schemes. The Trade Act of 1974 attempted to address these complications through the establishment of Section 406. Although similar to Sections 201, 202, 203, and Section 406 was intended to provide a lower standard of injury and a faster relief procedure, and requires the investigation to focus on imports from a specific country. Given the difficulty of proving Section 406, however, only 13 cases have received remedy under the laws since the provisions were enacted in 1974. 
   In other words, in 26 years only 13 cases have received remedies under the law. It is not a very good batting average. 
   The United States Trade Representative acknowledged that the import relief authorities provided under current law are flawed, and, thus, to her credit, the Product-Specific Safeguard protocol language in the U.S.-China bilateral agreement was negotiated to enhance the ability of the U.S. to respond more genuinely and immediately to market disruptions caused by Chinese products entering the United States. 
   Nevertheless, the House of Representative recognized that the protocol language could not provide real relief to U.S. industries that might be threatened by a surge of imports from China, and, therefore, the House-passed PNTR measure includes the Levin-Bereuter language on import surges. This language is a significant improvement over current law and the language included in the protocol to the U.S.-China bilateral agreement. 
   However, the House import surge safeguard provisions continue to lack an essential element. They continue to fall short on a point of utmost importance. While very, very close to providing meaningful benefits, the Levin-Bereuter import surge safeguard language does not provide a reasonable assurance to U.S. industry or workers that remedies against harmful import surges will be taken in a timely manner. 
   One of the most serious problems encountered with the use of import surge safeguards is the delays in taking action. Whether required by law or not, the administration can never seem to meet specific dates, and days turn into weeks and weeks turn into months. Meanwhile, U.S. industries and workers must sit by, unable to respond, as they watch their market share, their profits and their jobs dwindle away. 
   My amendment finally adds a certainty to the import surge safeguards. It is simple and to the point. My amendment would put into effect the relief recommended by the International Trade Commission (ITC) in the case of an affirmative determination of market disruption in the event that no action is taken by the President or the U.S. Trade Representatives, seventy days after the ITC report is submitted. Again, my amendment assures U.S. manufacturers and farmers and workers that action will occur on an ITC affirmative determination that a market disruption has occurred, and under the exact time frame as provided under the LEVIN-Bereuter provisions. 
   The Levin-Bereuter provisions provide legislative time frames on market disruption investigations. First, the Levin-Bereuter provisions require an ITC determination within 60 days of the initiation of an investigation, or 90 days in the investigation of confidential business information. Following the ITC action, the U.S. Trade Representative has 55 days to make a recommendation to the President regarding the case. Within 15 days after receipt of a recommendation from the U.S. Trade Representative, the President is directed to take action. Thus, the Levin-Bereuter provisions were intended to initiate action within 70 days following the ITC affirmative determination. 
   In real life, however, Section 401 cases have not existed for years, and many of the six Section 201 decisions that received some remedy over the last five years were delayed by weeks and even months beyond the current statutory deadline! U.S. firms have lost confidence in these provisions, and they cannot afford to pay legal expenses for decisions that might never be. 
   I have been particularly concerned about the U.S. steel wire-rod case. Wire-rod producers had to wait almost five months beyond the statutory deadline to receive a decision by the President that remedies would be put into place! The U.S. steel wire rod industry filed for relief under Section 201 of the trade law on December 30, 1998, and followed lengthy, costly procedures consistent with the statute. The domestic wire rod industry was encouraged after a recommendation for relief was provided by the International Trade Commission, and the industry looked eagerly to the President's decision, which was required under statute within 60 days, or by September 27, 1999. The U.S. steel wire rod company officials, workers and their families and communities waited, and waited, and waited. However, September 1999 came and went, the fall foliage dropped from the trees, leaving them bare to the north, south, east and west, the Thanksgiving feast was held and the family gathered round and sang songs, and the Christmas season came and the Christmas season went--there was no Santa Claus, Virginia--New Year's Day was celebrated--and yet, no action. As the days slipped from the calendar, imports rose! In fact, imports rose 12 percent from November to December 1999 and were up 15 percent over 1998. 
   The real story is that, with each passing day, production was lost and  American jobs 
   were sacrificed. Lost income to the company became lost income to the bankers, to the company suppliers, to the tax base that supports local schools and roads. Worse, there was lost income to American families. Who pays for the Christmas presents that every little child dreams of? 
   Time is money. That is what they say. 
   In February 2000, the President announced that relief would be granted to the U.S. steel wire rod industry. This was very happy news and received joyfully in the steel community. But, the fact remains that the money lost in the wait for a decision was lost forever. 
   China's trade with the U.S. continues to skyrocket. Imports of consumers goods, agricultural goods, and manufactured products from China are currently entering the U.S. market at an unprecedented rates! The United States has it largest bilateral deficit with China, which grew $910 million to a record $7.22 billion in June 2000 alone. 
   Why is my amendment necessary? Because when we are successful in plugging one hole in the Chinese dike, thousands more seem to spring through, gushing imports. According to official Department of Commerce import statistics, low-priced Chinese imports of steel rail joints have increased approximately 788 percent from 1997 to 2000. As in the steel wire rod situation, these Chinese imports have resulted in lost sales and depressed prices for the American industry. I have a manufacturer of steel rail joints in Huntington, West Virginia, the Portec Rail Products, Inc. 
   Speaking of Huntington, my recollection reminds me that there was a congressman from West Virginia who resided in Huntington, WV, around the turn of the century. His name was Hughes. 
   He had a daughter on the Titanic when that great ship went down and carried with it his daughter along with more than 1,500 other victims. Only 713 persons were rescued off that Titanic that went to its watery grave on the morning of April 15, 1912. 
   I care about the future of this manufacturer of steel rail joints in Huntington, WV. I care about its future, and I care about the future of the people who work there. There are thousands and thousands of small manufacturers that have a critical need for strong trade laws and a critical need to have an assurance that the laws will work as intended. Portec Rail Products, Inc., is a small business. It makes steel rail joints that hold rail sections together and allow the construction of the many miles of railroad that provide smooth transit in this country for both commercial and passenger trains. 
   Portec has provided solid, semiskilled manufacturing jobs for many hard-working West Virginians. It also supports the State's economy by purchasing high quality steel bars from other West Virginia steel producers. This company has added to the prosperity of my State of West Virginia and to the Nation. This company is facing a flood of Chinese imports, however. During the first quarter of 2000, for example, Chinese imports were at a record pace of 175,000 pounds, a figure which, if annualized, would amount to a 788-percent increase since 1997. The situation facing Portec is an authentic, true-life example of why this Senate should adopt the Byrd amendment. The workers of Portec are being bled dry under this hail of imports. I urge the Senate to help these workers to ensure that they are not subject to the ugly situation that the U.S. steel wire rod workers endured. Let us not sit by idly, twiddling our thumbs and biting our fingernails and watching our toenails grow, by watching also these workers' savings, so painfully secured, become washed away, and watch the slow erosion of morale and confidence. This amendment would help Portec to fight back. 
   I say to my colleagues, help me to help Portec and other U.S. manufacturers and farmers. 
   Chinese state-owned enterprise continues to remain a major source of jobs in China. Many of these state-owned enterprises are directly controlled by the Chinese Government and they play a central role in China's monetary scheme. In fact, the Bureau of National Affairs reported on July 21 of this year that the China Daily quoted Yang Zilin, President of the Export-Import Bank of China, as saying that China's state-backed financing played a strong role in boosting China's exports in the first half of this year. That's right, a Chinese official readily acknowledges the systematic use of export subsidies to help boost China's skyrocketing exports. In case anyone is wondering, export subsidies directly impede the ability of American firms to compete with the Chinese. 
   My amendment is consistent with the goals of the House-passed China PNTR bill. It improves the certainty of the implementation of import relief in cases of affirmative determinations by the International Trade Commission of market disruption to domestic producers of like or directly like products. It has been widely proclaimed by the White House and many in Congress supporting the China PNTR legislation that the product-specific safeguard provisions are a critical component of the U.S.-China bilateral agreement. My amendment ensures compliance to the timeframe that Congress intends. More importantly, it provides a standard upon which American workers and American businesses can rely. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require. 
   Voting in support of this amendment sends a message that the U.S. Senate seeks transparency to China's likely accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). It sends a message that the Senate is prepared to ``stand up'' for U.S. industries, such as iron and steel, coal mining, and petroleum, as well as U.S. agriculture producers, such as the apple industry, and the beef industry. A vote in support of this amendment places members on record that they demand China's compliance with the promises that China has made under the bilateral trade agreement that it signed with the United States. 
   This amendment is simple and straightforward. There is no hidden poison pill! There is no trick procedure! There is no so-called catch twenty-two to this amendment! It does not impede the possible benefits of China's accession to the WTO that many of my colleagues are hoping for. 
   My amendment would require the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to obtain a commitment by the People's Republic of China to disclose information relating to China's plans to comply with the World Trade Organization (WTO) subsidy obligations. The amendment requires the USTR to obtain a commitment by China to disclose essential subsidy information unique to China's communist market. Specifically, the amendment would require China to identify, up front, current state-owned enterprises engaged in export activities; describe state support for those enterprises; set forth a time table for compliance by China with the subsidy obligations of the WTO, and the amendment provides the USTR with authority to vote against China's WTO accession without such a commitment. 
   This amendment only seeks to disclose information that confirms China's promised compliance with the WTO subsidy rules! It simply seeks that China disclose essential subsidy information forthright, openly, in the bright light of sunshine on a cloudless day. If China is serious about the promises that it has made to the United States on subsidies, this information should easily be provided. This amendment also helps with the many questions that have surrounded the transparency of the WTO rules, in general. 
   Let us not place U.S. industries in the position of being unfairly injured by Chinese imports illegally subsidized. Without his information, U.S. industries will be required to pay the huge fees associated with filing antidumping and countervailing duty cases in order to pursue data on illegal subsidy behavior in China. 
   We know that a significant portion of the economy of the People's Republic of China consists of state-owned enterprises! We know that Chinese enterprises receive significant subsidies from the Chinese government! We know that Chinese state-owned enterprises account for a significant portion of exports from the Chinese government! 
   This is a matter of fact. So I say to my friends here in the Senate, do not fool yourselves! State-owned enterprises continue to be the most significant source of employment in most areas in China, and some reports suggest that these subsidized enterprises accounted for as much as 65 percent of the jobs in many areas of China in 1995--the most recent data that the Library of Congress could provide on this matter. That's right. State-owned enterprises likely account for 65 percent of the jobs in most areas of China. What kind of funds and other assistance do state-owned enterprises in China receive from their government? We should know. Help me find out by voting in support of this amendment! 
   We should know. We ought to know. I ask that other Senators help us to know by helping us to find out this information. They can do that by voting in support of this amendment. 
   I understand that China has stepped up to the plate and signed a bilateral agreement with the United States that proclaims that China will cease the use of subsidies prohibited under the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement), including those subsidies contingent upon export performance and subsidies contingent upon the use of domestic over imported goods, which are strictly prohibited under the SCM. But, guess what? On July 21, 2000--just a few weeks ago--the President of the Export-Import Bank of China, Yan Zilin, was quoted in the China Daily as saying that China's state-backed financing played a strong role in boosting China's exports in the first half of this year! China is subsidizing its products to ensure that they can be exported  into foreign markets--including our market. U.S. companies cannot compete with such subsidies. Are Senators aware that China's machinery and electronic exports grew by 42.1 percent in the first half of 2000 reaching $47.1 billion and accounting for 41.1 percent of total exports? 
   Moreover, since having signed the bilateral agreement with the U.S., China has expressed a view that it should be included in the grouping of the poorest countries in the WTO--thus exempting China from the disciplines of the WTO subsidy codes altogether. We need to send the Chinese a strong message about the use of subsidies. We need to put in place some disclosure procedures that improve transparency about the use of such subsidies to Chinese industries. 
   My colleagues who are dead set against any amendments to this bill are bound to reflect back to the U.S.-China bilateral agreement and argue that the USTR has already secured an agreement from China to eliminate all WTO illegal subsidies, and that the WTO requires certain compliance procedures already. 
   However, the Chinese government oversees the top-to-bottom operations of many industries such as iron and steel, coal mining, petroleum extraction and refining, as well as the electric power utilities, banking, and transportation sectors. The staunchest supporters of passing PNTR to China acknowledge that the trade rules that the Chinese have agreed to will likely in the short term cause widespread employment. If the past is an accurate indicator, the Chinese government will be very tempted to simply ignore the rules that they agreed to and to use their domestic state-owned enterprises as a jobs program. 
   Former Secretary of Commerce William Daley stated that ``I do not pretend to think that this implementation of this agreement by the Chinese will be easy for them (the Chinese), and I would assume that we will have to, in the next administration, have to be very aggressive in their enforcement of the commitments that have been made.'' 
   Let me remind you that, without doubt, subsidies with all of our trading partners have been very difficult issues to resolve, and not all subsidies are actionable. In fact, with years of trade relations and negotiations, the U.S. has yet to reach a subsidy understanding with the European Union on agriculture or on some industrial sectors such as aeronautics. 
   There is no harm in the extra measure of protection that is provided by my subsidy disclosure amendment. It provides transparency and will help many U.S. industries make improved, more educated decisions. So I urge members to support U.S. steelworkers, apple growers, electronic producers and vote for this amendment.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have returned to keep the vigil on my attempt, in concert with other Senators, to have a debate on permanent normal trade relations, PNTR, with the People's Republic of China. I shall once again implore my fellow colleagues to consider reason, to listen to our case as we discuss these amendments, and to consider them carefully; let your conscience be your guide, as the old saying goes. I hope that all Senators will look carefully at the merits of these amendments. Should we not crack this big fortune cookie? Just imagine the PNTR as a large fortune cookie. Should we not crack it and fully realize what lies inside PNTR before we rush to pass this legislation? What is the rush? Fortune cookies look sweet and tempting on the outside, but they can hold a less than appetizing message inside. Should we not look, should we not peer, lift the covers and see what is inside? Should we not look before we leap? 
   So far, this debate reminds me of a greasy pig contest at a county fair. The distinguished senior Senator from Mississippi, who presides over the Senate today--and, of course, I would not expect a response from the Chair, but I daresay that the Senator from Mississippi has made his presence known at many a county fair in the great State of Mississippi. At those county fairs, I am sure he is acquainted with the greasy pig contest. We talk about the greasy pole, and now we refer to the greasy pig--the greasy pig contest at a county fair. Everyone tries to slow down that pig, everybody tries to catch that pig, but the hands just slip away. That pig is greased and nobody can catch hold of the pig. Everyone is trying to slow down the greasy pig, but the pig is greased and just keeps on running. 
   I feel like one of those poor rubes out here chasing the greasy pig. By the way, one of the best pigs of all is the Poland-China hog. My dad used to buy 10 or 12 of those Poland-China pigs every year, and I would go around the community and gather up the leftovers from the tables of coal miners' wives. They would save these scraps of food for me and I would go around after school and pick up those scraps. I would take the scraps and feed them to the Poland-China pigs. Well, it just happens that today I am talking about the greased China PNTR pig. 
   I am trying my best to slow it down. Here the crowd is standing on their feet, and they are shouting. They are saying: ROBERT C. BYRD tried to get his hand on that greasy pig and tried to hold that pig. But the pig gets away. He can't hold that pig. Here we are--a few Senators--trying to slow down this greasy China PNTR pig so that we can get some amendments added or, perhaps by display of our judgment on this legislation, cause some of our fellow Members to say: Whoa, whoa, here; let's wait a minute. What are we doing? Why are we in such a hurry? 
   May I ask, do we have a copy of the bill that came out of the Senate committee? All right. I will have it in a moment. But that is not the legislation the Senate is talking about. That is not the bill that came out of the Senate committee. While I am securing that bill, I shall submit to the chairman of the Finance Committee a copy of the amendment I am about to call up. If he will take a look at it, we may want to discuss a time limit on it. 
   Back to this greasy pig, other Senators and I are trying simply to get the Senate to stop, look, and listen before it rushes pellmell into a vote on this legislation. 
   Here it is. This is S. 2277, a bill to terminate the application of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 with respect to the People's Republic of China. 
   It is a very short bill. As all Senators may see, it is two full pages. Of course, it really is not two full pages. The first page simply states the number of the bill, the title of the bill, and the Senators' names who are supporting it. There it is. Page 1, page 2, page 3; and page 3 consists only of four lines. There are three and a half lines, as a matter of fact, on page 3. There it is. This is what the Senate Finance Committee reported to this body, reported to the Calendar. This is it. This is the product of the work of the Senate Finance Committee on the subject of trading with China. But this bill is not what we are talking about. This is not what we are debating. This is not what we are attempting to amend. The bill is not before the Senate, it is at the desk. But this is not the bill we are attempting to amend. 
   What we are doing here in the Senate is this. We have taken the House bill. 
   May I ask the chairman, has the House bill ever had consideration by the Senate Finance Committee?

   Mr. BYRD. Very well. But that bill came over from the House to the Senate. Unfortunately for those of us who would like to see the bill slowed down and perhaps amended to make it a better bill, we find there has been kind of a contract entered into, if I may put it that way. It was not a written contract. Perhaps I should say it is an understanding rather than a contract. 
   There seems to be an understanding among some Senators that perhaps with the House--I don't know how far this understanding goes, but Senators who have entered into this understanding 
   will vote against any amendment--any amendment, any amendment--to the House bill. We are not going to debate the Senate bill. We are not going to act upon the Senate bill. We have taken up the House bill, and no amendments shall pass. That is it. No amendments shall pass. 
   I want to say to the Chair, to the distinguished Senator from Alabama who presides over the Senate, that I have been in legislative bodies now 54 years. I have been in this Congress 48 years. I have been in this body 42 years. This is something that is absolutely new to me, this method of legislating where Senators and the administration--I am talking about Senators on both sides--enter into an understanding somehow. I don't know whether they met and had a show of hands or had a debate about it. But anyway, we have been told by Senators on this floor that they will vote against any amendment, no matter what its merits. It doesn't matter who offers the amendment. It doesn't matter how good an amendment it may be. The decision has been made to reject every amendment--reject all amendments. Why? Why the hurry? 
   The powers that be--whoever they are--don't want an amendment because they say that would mean the bill would have to go back to the House. And they say that would cause a conference between the two Houses and that would mean a conference report. That would mean each House would have to vote on that conference report. As I gather from my grapevine information, these Senators are concerned that if the House were to vote again on this measure, it might not pass. There are some who think it would not pass the House if the House voted on it again. I think we have come to a pretty  poor pass when we won't consider amendments seriously and judge them on their merits and vote accordingly. But that is apparently what is happening here. 
   I feel like one of those poor rubes out there chasing the greasy China PNTR pig, trying my best to slow it down with some good amendments. But that pig is well greased, as you can understand by now. It is flying through the Senate, flying through the Senate. This pig is tearing along and Members have made a blood vow to keep hands off and just let ``old porky'' run; let ``old porky'' run. 
   I will, however, continue to pursue some debate on this bill and to offer at least two amendments that I believe will improve the legislation. I shall offer an amendment momentarily that is straightforward. It would require the U.S. Trade Representative to obtain a commitment by the People's Republic of China to disclose information relating to China's plans to comply with the World Trade Organization, WTO, subsidy obligations. 
   This is an important issue aimed at ensuring that the American people and their representatives here and in the other branches of the government truly realize what is inside the big Chinese trade fortune cookie. State-owned enterprises continue to be the most significant source of employment in most areas in China, and some reports suggest these subsidized enterprises accounted for as much as 65 percent of the jobs in many areas of China in 1995. That is two-thirds of the jobs. The most recent data that the Library of Congress could provide on this matter indicate those figures. Let me state them again: The subsidized enterprises in China accounted for as much as 65 percent of the 
   jobs in many areas of China in 1995. 
   Members of Congress need to remember that we are here to defend the people of the United States, to use our best judgment at all times, to exercise our very best talents in behalf of the people who send us here. I am here to represent the people of West Virginia, Democrats and Republicans, old and young, black and white, rich and poor. I am here to represent them. Other Members are likewise here to represent the people of their respective States. We are here to represent them. This includes, may I say, the average American worker. 
   There are grave implications to Sino-American relations as a result of granting PNTR to China. I believe that the Chinese have developed a keen understanding of the American political system. I have no doubt that many Senators and U.S. businesses are naive about the increased workings of the Chinese Government and its agenda. China is not a free market economy. It is not on the verge of becoming a free market economy. It is a Communist, centrally controlled economy. The Chinese Government oversees the top-to-bottom operations of many industries such as iron and steel, coal mining, petroleum extraction and refining, as well as the electric power utilities, banking, and transportation sectors. The whole thing, one might say. 
   Government control reigns from top to bottom, supreme in China. Government control. 
   I was in China in 1975 along with our former colleague, Sam Nunn, and our former colleague, Jim Pearson, from the Republican side. At that time I was told that no individual in China owned an automobile. There were no privately owned automobiles. Oceans of bicycles but no privately owned automobile. 
   There is some limited private enterprise in China. But private investment is heavily monitored and restricted by the Government. In fact, it has been suggested that the Chinese Government only sell minority shares, such as 25 percent of an enterprise, for the sole purpose of making money while still containing effective control over the operations of that enterprise. 
   These conditions are serious impediments to fair trade and to free trade. Yet we really do not have much detailed information about China's state-owned enterprises and the type or amount of the benefits that those enterprises receive from the Chinese Government. It is almost impossible to measure accurately the extent of subsidized operations or the touted move to privatization in China, due to the lack of reliable Chinese statistics. 
   My amendment today that I will shortly send to the desk would help to secure this information. What is wrong with that? This is information that is vital to many U.S. businesses and vital to American workers. My amendment is an effort to help secure that. What is wrong with that? 
   I hope the American people are following this debate--I am pretty sure they are not; they are not following it. No, the American people are not watching. If they were watching it, there would be more Senators here in the Chamber today. How many Senators are there here today? One, two, three--that is the whole kit and kaboodle--three Senators. So the American people are not watching it. They don't know what is happening. 
   My amendment would help to secure statistics that are vital to U.S. businesses and American workers. 
   One of the basic principles of liberalized trade is to obtain obligations to restrict Government interference, which provides an unfair advantage to national commerce. The WTO agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures restricts the use of subsidies and establishes a three-class framework on subsidies consisting of red light, yellow light, dark amber, and green light. 
   The SCM prohibits subsidies contingent upon export performance and subsidies contingent upon the use of domestic over imported goods. 
   We know that a significant portion of the economy of the People's Republic of China consists of state-owned enterprises. We know that Chinese enterprises receive significant subsidies from the Chinese Government. We know that Chinese state-owned enterprises account for a significant portion of exports from the Chinese Government. We also know that U.S. manufacturers and farmers can not compete fairly with these subsidized state-owned enterprises. So, once again, the question remains: how can the United States ensure that Chinese subsidies do not undermine U.S. commerce and threaten American jobs? That is what we are trying to find out by way of my amendment.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am flattered by the comments of my colleague, my seatmate who sits right here. I appreciate his friendship, and I appreciate his many, many words of advice, our many conversations we have had together about the Senate, about our country, and about the Constitution. 
   So if we can just think, as we do this poem--I always run the risk, of course, of having a lapse of memory. But after 50 years of quoting poetry, although I have had a few lapses of memory, I always take them as they come. It is something that is natural, nothing to be embarrassed about. Sometimes I start over and get the poem right. 
   But I am thinking of this legislation that is before us, and I am thinking of what is going on here. I have referred to a cabal. It isn't that, of course, but there certainly is an understanding abroad here, among Senators on both sides--certain Senators I think are probably working with the administration--that there will be no amendments, no amendments will pass, they will vote down every amendment. 
   Well, a few of my colleagues and I are trying to improve this legislation. We are not offering any killer amendments. But we are offering them because we think the bill would be improved. 
   This action on my part, and on the part of my colleagues who are attempting to improve the bill, might be likened to putting a fence around the edge of a cliff while an ambulance runs in the valley. The ambulance represents this legislation, which, if passed, in the long run, I fear, will result in increased unfair trade and constitute an injury to the American worker and to the American businesspeople. 
 `Twas a dangerous cliff, as they freely confessed, Though to walk near its crest was so pleasant; But over its terrible edge there had slipped A duke and full many a peasant. So the people said something would have to be done, But their projects did not at all tally; Some said, ``Put a fence around the edge of the cliff,'' Some, ``An ambulance down in the valley.'' 
 But the cry for the ambulance carried the day, As it spread through the neighboring city; A fence may be useful or not, it is true, But each heart became brimful of pity For those who slipped over that dangerous cliff; And the dwellers in highway and alley Gave pounds or gave pence, not to put up a fence, But an ambulance down in the valley. 
 ``For the cliff is all right, if you're careful,'' they said, ``And, if folks even slip and are dropping, It isn't the slipping that hurts them so much, As the shock down below when they're stopping.'' So day after day, as these mishaps occurred, Quick forth would these rescuers sally To pick up the victims who fell off the cliff, With their ambulance down in the valley. 
 Then an old sage remarked: ``It's a marvel to me That people give far more attention To repairing results than to stopping the cause, When they'd much better aim at prevention. Let us stop at its source all this mischief,'' cried he. ``Come, neighbors and friends, let us rally; If the cliff we will fence we might almost dispense With the ambulance down in the valley.'' 
 ``Oh, he's a fanatic,'' the others rejoined, ``Dispense with the ambulance? Never! He'd dispense with all charities, too, if he could; No! No! We'll support them forever. Aren't we picking up folks just as fast as they fall? Shall this man dictate to us? Shall he? Why should people of sense stop to put up a fence, While the ambulance works down in the valley?'' 
 But a sensible few, who are practical too, Will not bear with such nonsense much longer; They believe that prevention is better than cure, And their party will soon be the stronger. Encourage them then, with your purse, voice, and pen, And while other philanthropists dally,  They will scorn all pretense and put up a stout fence Round the cliff that hangs over the valley. 
 Better guide well the young than reclaim them when old, For the voice of true wisdom is calling, ``To rescue the fallen is good, but `tis better To prevent other people from falling.'' Better close up the source of temptation and crime Than to deliver from dungeon or galley; Better put a strong fence round the top of the cliff Than an ambulance down in the valley.''  
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Now, it is not so much that this happens to be my amendment, but this does happen to be an important measure, and this does happen to be an important amendment, in my judgment.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have been informed that several Senators are not here, they having thought there would be at least an hour and a half to 3 hours before there would be a vote. I am not going to take advantage of Senators in that way, and I, therefore, shall proceed. 
   But with now the time running, let me say, I think this is a travesty upon the legislative process. This is a far-reaching measure. There are important amendments that will be called up and voted down--summarily voted down--by many Members; at least, many Members will summarily vote against any amendment. Some have already announced their intention to vote against any amendment. 
   So a rhetorical question, I think, would be in order. Why have any debate? Why call up amendments? Why go through this charade? I have called up an amendment. We all know it is going to be rejected because some Senators are going to vote against any amendments, no matter what the amendment provides. They can be good amendments, they can be better amendments, they can be the best amendments. They are all going to be rejected. What kind of legislative process is that? 
   I have been in this Congress 48 years. I have been in the Senate 42 years. I have never seen anything like this. Members are very forthright in saying--they don't make any bones about it--that they have agreed they will not support any amendment. Why? Because they say it would mean, if the amendment should carry, that the measure would have to go to the House and then to a conference. 
   The House might accept the amendment. There might not have to be a conference. The House might accept the amendment. And if a conference did ensue, again, so what? That is the way we have been doing things for decades. The Senate votes. If there are amendments to the House bill, then there is a conference, unless the House accepts the amendment itself. Here are some amendments that, if the House should have an opportunity to vote on them, undoubtedly would receive good votes in the House and perhaps, who knows, they might pass the House. But this administration doesn't want any vote. 
   I ask unanimous consent that I may ask a question of the distinguished chairman of the committee.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, that is a forthright answer. It is quite enlightening. I certainly thank the distinguished chairman. 
   I seem to recall that there have been many important measures over the years that have been debated. Many have been enacted; some have been rejected. The Versailles Treaty was rejected. 
   What I am saying is, this is not the only important measure. I grant that it is very important. The chairman says it is such an important measure, the administration does not want it amended. At least that is his recollection of what the administration's position is. But there have been many important measures. I won't go through them now, but I can think of a good many that have come up here since I have been a Member of the Senate. 
   I was here when the 1964 Civil Rights Act was enacted. I believe it was before the Senate 116 days, including the 2 weeks that were used in calling up that measure. But we had 
   amendments. There had to be cloture filed on it in order to get a final vote. There was the natural gas bill of 1978. One could go on and name equally important measures that were far-reaching measures, but never was there the blood oath that was taken by Senators that they would stand to the man or to the woman against any amendment: Regardless of its merit, it shall not pass. And since when has the Senate bowed the neck to any administration and agreed, either publicly or in private or with a wink and a nod, that we will stand with you, Mr. Administration; we will be with you; we will stand against any amendment. It does not make any difference how it might affect my constituents. It does not make any difference how it might affect my sons, my daughters, my grandchildren. It does not make any difference, Mr. Administration, or Mr. President; we will stand with you; we will be against this amendment. 
   What is the Senate coming to when the Senate engages in that kind of charade? I say Senators ought to bow their heads in shame. What is happening to the Senate when that kind of situation obtains? That is what we have come to here, where we follow, like sheep, the administration over a cliff. 
   I dare say there will be some Senators who have taken that blood oath--I will refer to it as a blood oath; it is probably as good as a blood oath because apparently that is the way it is going to work--who will have agreed to pursue that kind of course in spite of the rules, the history, the traditions of the Senate, in spite of the oath of office they took. 
   Each of us takes an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. Here is the Constitution of the United States. I hold it in my hand. Are we supporting the Constitution of the United States which says that the Congress shall have power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce? Not exactly in those words, but it is in section 8 of article I of this Constitution: Congress shall have power to regulate commerce. That is what this bill is about, commerce. Yet we are not going to let Congress regulate it. We are not going to let the Congress of the United States uphold and utilize its power under the Constitution of the United States in this regard. 
   This same Constitution says, with regard to amendments, that all revenue-raising measures will originate in the other body. But the Senate may amend, ``as on other bills,'' it says. So that would include the measure that is before the Senate. So we are giving the back of our hand to the Constitution of the United States. We are not exercising our responsibilities--not just our rights, but we are not exercising our responsibilities to the people, to the Constitution, to this country, to our children, to our grandchildren, and to ourselves. We are not standing by our duty and our responsibility if we enter into such an agreement as that among us. 
   I daresay some of the Senators who have fallen into that pothole will come to rue the day. I will have more to say about this in that regard before we have the final vote. Today, I cast my 15,801st vote in this Senate; 15,801 votes. No Senator in the history of the Republic can match it. I have never entered into such an agreement. When I was in the leadership, when I was a leader, when I was a whip, when I was secretary of the Democratic conference, whether in the majority or minority, I never asked my friends in the Senate to stand to the man. 
   I am not saying that the majority leader or minority leader have asked Senators to do that. But there is some kind of a virus that has come along here and seized on the Chamber and, all of a sudden, there are several Senators  who are going to vote against any amendment. Think about that. I would not want my constituents to think I would do that. I might want to listen to a Senator. He might be a Republican. I might want to listen to that Republican explain his amendment, and I might want to vote for it, and I might vote for it. I might vote for it even if my fellow Democrats were against it. 
   This Senator is not going to be bound by any ``blood oath.'' I objected to that when I was a member of the house of delegates 54 years ago. I stood up in a caucus and said, ``I'm not going to be bound by this caucus.'' It was a Democratic caucus. ``I am not going to walk around here with shackles and chains on my wrists and legs and, more importantly, on my conscience.'' 
   I think a Senator is entitled to be heard on his amendment and entitled to have the frank opinions of other Senators. He is entitled to have his colleagues' opinions, short of any shackles and chains that are binding them, as it were, to vote against any amendment. 
   So I am utterly wasting my time. I am just wasting my time. I am sorry to say I am impinging on the time of the Presiding Officer. We have the manager of the bill here and I am wasting his time. Why go through all of this when Senators have stood upon this floor and said--I have heard them--that they will vote against any amendment to this bill. Why? Because if the amendment were to be adopted, it would mean that the bill would then have to go back to the House and go to conference. Well, so what. That is the way we do things. That is the process, and it has been the process for decades. That will continue to be the process. We go to conference or the House accepts the bill. In any event, both Houses have to act together in unison and have to agree upon any measure before it can be sent to the President, providing it is a bill or joint resolution. 
   So there you are. That is the reason. I will tell you why. They are afraid; the administration is afraid. Senators are afraid--those who have taken this position--of being 
   against any amendment. They are afraid that the Senate, in the free exercise of its wisdom and its judgment, might accept and adopt some of these amendments. When they go back to the House in that case, then the House, in its wisdom, might accept the amendments. And so this measure would not be passed as a clean measure. 
   What are we coming to here? I can't remember that ever happening in my time in the Senate. It is an unwritten agreement, but it is an agreement, apparently. Shame, shame on us; shame on the Senate; shame on the administration, if that is the policy they are pushing. Are we slaves to the administration? Are we slaves or are we men? Are we free men and women? After all, when it is boiled down, in essence, Milton's Paradise Lost is about freedom of the will. God gave man freedom of the will. Now, why don't you Senators exercise that freedom of the will? 
   I understand that all who vote against amendments are not doing so just because they have entered into some kind of unwritten agreement that they are going to be against all amendments. There are some Senators who will be against this amendment I am offering. They would vote against it, no matter what. So I certainly don't impugn the character or honesty and integrity of Senators. I am sickened by this idea that we have to pass this as a clean bill and no matter what amendment or whose amendment it is, or where it started, or what its impact or merits, we are going to vote down all amendments. That sickens me. You may say, so what, he is sickened. Well, it is more than ``so what.'' This is the United States Senate. 
   What a sad day when Senators look at a measure and say: We will not support any amendment. What a reflection upon man's freedom of the will. In the body which is the premier upper House of the world, where amendments are assured and where freedom of debate is assured, what a sad reflection upon our attitudes toward our responsibilities and our duties and toward our rights on behalf of our people. The people of West Virginia want this amendment. The people of West Virginia support the amendment. But they are going to be gagged. They can support it all they want. It will not pass. It cannot pass. The same can be said for other amendments. 
   I have heard it said here, we are going to influence the Chinese to move farther, to a more moderate society, farther in that direction; we have to pass this, we will have more influence. The Chinese have been around for thousands of years, thousands of years. The Chinese were one of the earliest peoples to have a civilized society. And they are in no big hurry. When they seek to achieve an objective, they can wait. They have the patience of that great man of Ur, Job. They have the patience. 
   And they say we will influence them, we will influence them to become more amenable to our views and the views of the democracy. We don't even have a democracy here. This is a republic. The very idea that we are going to influence them. We have been in business for 212 years here; they have been in business for 2,000, 3,000, 5,000 years or longer. They were around when the pyramids of Egypt were created by the ancient Egyptians. So we are going to influence them? Well, let's see who is influenced in the long run. 
   The amendment I offer is a good amendment. If we can influence them on this amendment, we will have achieved something. 
   I say to the former Senator from Wyoming, we don't call attention to people in the galleries, but he has the right to the floor as a former Senator. I say to my friend from Wyoming, who is a man of utterly good sense, good judgment, that if he were a Member of this body, he would laugh at this charade, he would laugh at this charade, were it not so serious. I am glad he is back on the floor today. At least there is a little wisdom in the Chamber at this moment. 
   Mr. President, as many Senators know, I have been working for many years to provide funding for a range of clean energy technologies. These technologies are essential to growing our economy while also ensuring that environmental improvements, energy security, public health, and air and water quality are met. The U.S. will need a range of energy resources if our nation is ever going to achieve a sustainable economic future, and we must expand the range of newer technologies and practices to meet even more challenging problems in the future. The very same argument can be made for China. It would be productive for both nations if we could leverage our hard-won technological advances while helping China develop in a more environmentally and economically sound manner. 
   Let me say this over again: It would be productive for both nations--China and the United States--if we could leverage our hard-won and costly, paid for by the taxpayers of America, technological advances, while helping China develop in a more environmentally and economically sound manner. 
   By 2020, energy technology experts estimate that global clean energy technology markets are expected to double, and these markets in developing countries alone could require a multi-trillion dollar investment as infrastructure is built and replaced. Clean energy technologies and other such beneficial mitigation actions such as carbon sequestration are essential responses if any nation, in this rapidly growing economy, ever hopes to adequately address burgeoning environment and energy concerns such as energy security, resource diversity, land use changes, air and water quality, and ultimately, global climate change. If one realizes that two-thirds of the global energy infrastructure has yet to be built and much of the current infrastructure will need to be upgraded or replaced, then every nation must play a role and strategically plan for this anticipated development. 
   I note that in May 2000, the U.S. and China signed a cooperative agreement on environment and development. Recognizing that these two intertwining issues are some of the most critical challenges in the coming century, our two nations have committed themselves to meeting ever-growing development needs in an economically and environmentally sound manner. As part of that agreement, the U.S. and China plan to expand and accelerate the transfer of clean energy technologies in order to meet energy demands and environmental protection challenges. Among a number of important features, this recent agreement  specifically calls for the increased utilization of Clean Coal Technologies. I believe that agreements like this are a gradual but positive step in bringing increased cooperation between our two nations, and I hope that future endeavors that build upon this foundation are pursued. 
   In 1985, I worked to create the Department of Energy's Clean Coal Technology program, a very successful research and development program. Originally designed to address acid rain reduction, the Clean Coal Technology program is now addressing a broader range of emission issues, including the reduction of greenhouse gases. It is well known that, just as coal has fueled much of the American economy, it will play a major role in China's development as well.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the clerk. 
   In conclusion, Mr. President, this is a pro-business amendment. It is a pro-environment amendment. It is a pro-labor amendment. It is a pro-America amendment. It is a pro-commonsense amendment. The amendment helps businesses to get clean energy technologies into the Chinese market. The amendment helps to clean the water and the air. 
   I have a book by the distinguished Vice President, Mr. GORE, entitled ``Earth in the Balance.'' This is where we can start to clean up the Earth. This amendment helps to clean the water and the air. It helps to reduce global climate change, and helps America use our resources and would help China to use its resources more efficiently. 
   Finally, this amendment promotes American-made clean energy technologies that help the U.S. economy. Who can be against that? I haven't heard one word in these 3 hours, not one word, of criticism concerning my amendment. Not one word by way of attacking my amendment on its merits. As a matter of fact, not many Senators--two or three only--have spoken a few short words in opposition to the amendment, but their arguments are not going to the merits of the amendment. As a matter of fact, I believe the Senators who have spoken would probably support this amendment if it were on some other bill. 
   I have crafted this amendment so that every Senator's interests are represented. Here is one of the cleanest, purest amendments that has ever been read at the desk where the clerk sits. Nobody is opposed to anything that is in the amendment. There hasn't been a word, not a single word spoken against this amendment. So it is a win-win opportunity that we should take advantage of today. 
   The only problem is that Senators have blinders on. I can remember back in 1947 when the State of West Virginia had 97,600 farms, had 97,000 horses, and 6,000 mules. When farmers use their horses, they put blinders on them. I am sure Senators understand what blinders are. They keep the horses from seeing an automobile and shying away from it, possibly running away, wrecking the wagon or the buggy, and ending up killing the passenger. 
   Senators who oppose this today say quite openly and frankly that they oppose it because any amendment adopted to this bill might kill the bill. This is not a killer amendment. I know a killer amendment when I see one. This is not a killer amendment. I have no interest in killing this bill by this amendment or any other amendment. I will vote against the bill. But I have not engaged in any dilatory tactics. I haven't engaged in any filibuster. I voted to take up the bill. I am not interested in killing it through dilatory actions. I am interested in improving it. This bill is going to pass the Senate. I read the handwriting on the wall. Belshazzar is not the only person who can see handwriting on the wall. I can read the handwriting on the wall. We have absolutely no chance of killing the bill if that is what we want to do. I prefer to improve it. It could be improved to the point that I would vote for it, but it will pass whether I vote for it or not. 
   This is no killer amendment. This amendment is a highly beneficial amendment to our own country, to the working people, to the businesspeople of this country, to the environmentalists and to the environment, to industry, to the Chinese. I have gone over that already so I won't repeat it again. It is not a killer amendment. I plead with Senators to take off the blinders on this amendment. 
   Take them off. Take off your blinders, Senators, and smudge that line that has been drawn in the sand. Take a good look at this amendment. That is why I have had it read again, just before voting on it. Take a good look at it. This amendment is no killer amendment. It is a sugar pill, candy-coated peppermint pill. There is no hidden ingredient. There is no arsenic here; no bitter aftertaste. It will not leave halitosis. It is a sugar-coated amendment. 
   This amendment will help our trading relations with China because it can help to assuage environmental concerns about China's coming rapid growth. It will help China. It will help the business community in our own country because it will encourage and enhance the marketability of clean energy technology in China. God knows they are going to need it. They are going to need it. It will help those businesses employ more people as they develop and sell these new energy technologies. Everybody benefits, everybody. And I believe the amendment would pass the House, if the House were given an opportunity to vote on this amendment. 
   But the Senators who oppose this amendment do not want that to happen. They don't want the House to have an opportunity to debate this amendment. They don't want the House to vote on this amendment. But it would pass the House, probably with flying colors. It is an opportunity that should not be missed just because some Members have taken what would amount to a blood oath to oppose all amendments--oppose all amendments. 
   It is a winning horse, a winning horse. You can't do better over at Charles Town at the races, I say to my friend from Delaware. You can't find a better horse over at Charles Town, just 75 miles from here. Go over there and see the winning horses. 
   But this is a winning horse that I have brought in here today; a winning horse. Look at its teeth, open its mouth--it is a winning horse. It is just waiting, just waiting, waiting patiently, may I say to the Senator from Massachusetts before he egresses from the Chamber, this is a horse that is just waiting to collect the prize. And all we have to do is say, ``giddy-up, giddy-up.'' It is my amendment that I am talking about--a winning horse. 
   Senators, let this pony run. Don't draw the line in the sand. Don't say no. Don't close one's ears, like Odysseus was told by Circe to put wax in his ears so that he wouldn't hear the singing sirens. Take the wax out of your ears. Let this pony run. I plead with Members to take off the blindfolds and look at this amendment on its many, many merits.  
   This will not hurt, Senators. Put just one toe, the big toe or the little toe, over that line in the sand that you have drawn. There is an oasis of benefits for everybody on the other side of the line. Take this step, take this brave, single step and cross over into the promised land, freed from the shackles of the oath that binds you. 
   A poem comes to my mind, written by J.G. Holland.

   Mr. BYRD. Fifteen minutes, 20 seconds. 
   I can't find my poem--ah, my trusty aide has found it. I don't need it anyhow. 
 God, give us men. A time like this demands Strong minds, great hearts, true faith and ready hands; Men whom the lust of office does not kill; Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy; Men who possess opinions and a will; Men who have honor; men who will not lie; Men who can stand before a demagog And damn his treacherous flatteries without winking. Tall men sun-crowned, who live above the fog In public duty and in private thinking; For while the rabble, with their thumb-worn creeds, Their large professions and their little deeds, Mingle in selfish strife, lo. Freedom weeps, Wrong rules the land and waiting justice sleeps. God give us men. Men who serve not for selfish booty, But real men, courageous, who flinch not at duty. Men of dependable character; men of sterling worth. Then wrongs will be redressed and right will rule the earth. God, give us men.  
   Mr. President, I yield back my time. I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur, up or down, on my amendment.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I thank all Senators for listening. And in particular I thank the distinguished manager of the bill, a venerable Senator whom I greatly admire, and with whom I often talk. We engage each other in conversation about our little dogs. He has a little dog. I have a little dog. It recalls to my attention an old song, an old fiddle song:  
   You better stop kicking my dog around. 
   Every time I come to town, 
   The boys start kicking my dog around. 
   Whether he's a poodle or whether he's a hound, 
   You better stop kicking my dog around.  
   That is the way the Senator from Delaware and I feel about it. I treasure his friendship. He has been a fine manager on this bill. But he is wrong in taking the position that he should vote against my amendment. 
   I also thank my friend on this side of the aisle, Mr. MOYNIHAN; as always, a gentleman and scholar. I thank him for the way he has conducted himself on this amendment and on other bills.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate is presently considering the extension of permanent normal trade relations status, or PNTR, to the People's Republic of China contingent upon China's accession to the World Trade Organization, WTO. Earlier this year, it appeared that China might seek to join the WTO this fall, but now, in the first blush of autumn, that possibility has  receded. And so has the urgency for us to consider granting PNTR on a permanent basis or on a temporary basis to China. Yet, here we are, with but a scant handful of days left in this Congress and a large number of must-pass appropriations bills awaiting our attention, discussing the merits or demerits or lack of merits of forevermore foregoing our annual ritual of reviewing and extending normal trade relations to China. 
   It might be worthwhile for the Senate to so consume its time, if we were taking this debate seriously. After all, it is quite a significant vote, the outcome of which may have long-lasting effects on our economy, on American jobs and on American workers. Proponents of extending PNTR to China note with some alarm that, should China join the WTO, the United States could be subject to sanctions by China because we do not currently treat it exactly the same as we do other trading partners, both in the WTO and outside the WTO. And that is true. We do not treat China the same as, say, the United Kingdom or Japan. We put conditions on our trade with China, human rights conditions and labor conditions and nonproliferation conditions. We do so out of concern for those issues with respect to China. 
   Our annual debate and vote to extend for another year normal trade relations, with conditions or without conditions, allows us, here in Congress, to comprehensively review our relationship with China. The annual vote on NTR is important to China, more important, perhaps, than any other single piece of legislation might be. The United States is a huge market, an attractive market, and an important market for Chinese goods. The competitive advantage of NTR tariff rates is consequential. It is both a carrot and a stick to persuade China to alter its behavior with regard to issues near and dear to Americans, such as religious freedom, such as nonproliferation. 
   I would be happy to spend many hours on this debate, and discussing this important trade and security relationship. I consider it an important debate. But I am somewhat dismayed to read news accounts about a cabal among Senators to stifle one of the most important rights granted by the Constitution to the Senate. That is the right to offer and have debate on and votes on amendments. In the House, the rule guides debate and the number and content of amendments that might be offered to a bill. That is perhaps necessary in a body with 435 Members. But the Constitution says: Each House may determine its own rules. The framers made the Senate a place where minority views, and small States, had an equal voice. 
   Thus, West Virginia, a State consisting of 24,000 square miles--as a matter of fact, 24,231.4 square miles--is not a very large State when placed beside, on a geographic map, the great State of New York, which is so ably represented and which has been so ably represented by the senior Senator from New York, Mr. MOYNIHAN. 
   I oppose this legislation with due apologies to my friend. And he is my friend--a man of great wit, of great stature, a man of natural grace, a student, a scholar, a teacher--PAT MOYNIHAN. I apologize to him for having to vote against this bill, but I shall do it with gusto. 
   The framers established the Senate as a forum for unlimited debate and unlimited amendment. Or did they? They certainly did so with respect to unlimited amendments. But for several years, there was the previous question here in the Senate by which debate could be limited. But when Aaron Burr completed his tenure as Vice President of the United States and made his farewell address to the Senate, in early March of 1805, he recommended that the previous question be dropped from the rules. It had only been used 10 times in the previous years from the inception of the Republic. When the rules were revised in 1806, the previous question was dropped. It was then that unlimited debate reigned pure and undefiled and unchallenged in the Senate of the United States. So this is a precious birthright. 
   By the way, there were no limitations placed upon debate from that time--1806 or 1805--until 1917, when the present rule XXII--not exactly the present rule; it has been changed some since then--but a rule providing for the invoking of cloture was adopted in the Senate in 1917. 
   But this group of Members--I do not know who they are, and I am not sure that such a group exists, but I will take rumor for truth at this point because it very well could occur to some Members to want a ``clean'' vote, up or down. 
   This group of Members, I read, want a ``clean'' vote, up or down, on the House-passed bill. They, and a number of House Members, do not want a conference. And they do not want a second vote in both Houses on a conference report. So these Senators--well-intentioned, well-meaning--are determined to defeat every amendment, I hear, to this bill, regardless of merit. So having heard it, let me accept it as the truth and proceed accordingly. I am embarrassed to read that. I hope that it is not true, that Members of this body would relinquish a critical Senate prerogative, especially over so important an issue. Perhaps they would say: Well, it isn't exactly relinquishing a prerogative. Other Senators may call up amendments, but we will vote them down. They shall not pass. 
   If it is true, then we are just spinning our wheels here, are we not, by trying to fulfill our Constitutional role of regulating foreign commerce? We are just spinning deep ruts in the Senate floor by attempting to offer amendments to improve this bill before we close off our opportunity to annually review and affect our relationship with China. 
   I have reviewed the House bill, somewhat cursorily, I admit. It is not that the House-passed bill is a bad bill. It contains a number of reporting requirements that attempt to assuage concerns about human rights and labor rights in China. But without the goal of an annual renewal of NTR status behind it, what force does a report have to affect behavior in China? How can a report protect American workers whose jobs are in jeopardy because of unfair actions in the trade field by China? How can a report protect American missionaries in China or Chinese citizens who wish to practice their religious beliefs? How does a report turn back a shipment of missile technology? How does a report turn back threatening words and actions directed at another nation like Taiwan? 
   The goal of this administration, and of the past few administrations--and I say this most advisedly; I have been in Congress now 48 years--and every administration since I came to Washington, Democratic and Republican, has been the same way, always singing the same old tune, and is guided, it seems to me, by the State Department. 
   The goal of all of these administrations, including the present one, has been to, bit by bit, eat away at the constitutional powers of this body to regulate foreign commerce. This is the message behind limiting mechanisms such as fast track. The argument is that our trading partners do not like agreements to be amended so it is take it or leave it for the Senate. But the Senate must make judgments based on our national interest. 
   Trade is a matter of increasing national interest. No one would dream of making the argument that we cannot vote for reservations or changes in arms control treaties because it would upset our negotiating partner. The Soviets promptly renegotiated the changes we made with respect to the INF treaty, a very fundamental change on the question of the very definition of the missiles that were the subject of the treaty. So are we to conclude that we can amend arms control treaties but not trade agreements, or even legislation dealing with trade agreements? 
   Trade has now become a varsity sport in America, especially here in Washington. It is very important to our well-being, important to millions of workers, important to the quality of our environment, important to the world's environment. It is important to large industrial and service sectors, a matter of such importance that we should at least pay careful attention to our constitutional responsibilities. The final product will be more in the national interest and Senators will have done their duty to their constituents and to our Nation, as it was envisioned by our Founding Fathers, if we debate this matter at length and if we offer amendments, debate them in good faith, and have votes up or down on them and let the chips fall where they may. 
   Is it not possible that we might improve this legislation by the vote of a  majority here in the Senate? Suppose one were to offer an amendment vital to our security interest. It is not germane, but there is no rule of germaneness in the Senate except under rule XVI with respect to appropriations bills or when time agreements obtain or when cloture is invoked. So why not? Why not offer subject matter that is important to our national security interest? 
   If there is a group of Senators who have, by tacit understanding, by a wink and a nod, or by words openly declared that they will oppose any and every amendment regardless of its complexity or its complexion or whether it is good or bad or in between--if there is such a group of Senators, why not abstain from that and let us vote? Let us have a vote up or down and have a vote based on the subject matter of the amendment without any prior agreement, without any wink or nod, if there be such. Let us see where the chips fall. 
   Are we to say that this particular bill is the acme of perfection and we should not have any further amendments of any sort regardless of merit? I don't think that would be the right way to commence. 
   Once granted, PNTR will be difficult, though not impossible, to retract. Any attempt to withdraw PNTR status in the future, if it is granted now, will cause an uproar, and not just in China. The diplomatic crowd in the aptly named Foggy Bottom here in D.C. will bleat that rejecting PNTR will upset delicate negotiations with the Chinese. The big business crowd will complain about lost opportunities to sell or invest in China. The Administration at the time will prate erroneously about Congress interfering with their sovereign right to conduct foreign affairs. And even in Congress, bills might be introduced, only to die an unremarked death in some committee or on some calendar. I have been here a long time. I have seen a lot of bills die and I know a thing or two about how to kill them. So I know that undoing a thing is much harder to do than doing it in the first place. It will be much harder to undo PNTR than it will be to grant it. 
   So why are we apparently so gung-ho to have this sham debate and vote now, this year, this week or next? There is no great urgency. The bill will not even take effect until China's accession to the WTO is voted upon. Why do it now, just weeks after a damning report has been issued about China's role in the proliferation of missiles and missile technology? Why do it now--why not next week sometime or next month or next year sometime--mere weeks after Chinese authorities conducted another raid on a so-called Christian sect that resulted in three Taiwan-born American citizens and approximately 100 Chinese citizens being arrested for meeting in worship? Why do it now, just months after Chinese officials have made still more threatening gestures toward Taiwan? 
   Why do it now, before the final negotiations on the bilateral U.S.-Chinese trade agreement, particularly the trade subsidy portions, have been ironed out? 
   Perhaps someone was listening to that advertisement I have heard on the TV so many times: Do it now, do it here. Well, we don't do it now. 
   China's record on trade agreements is not stellar. Since 1992, six trade agreements have been made--and broken--by China. In the last two years, we have seen the effects of dumping on the U.S. steel industry, as well as on the apple industry. So why are we rushing this vote? Why now? Why are we rushing this in such haste that we will not even seriously consider amendments that might improve the legislation? It is hardly perfect, sprung like Minerva, fully formed, from the forehead of Jove, or like Aphrodite from the ocean foam. 
   In that vein, I have several amendments prepared which I believe could improve this agreement. One concerns prospective U.S. investments in the Chinese energy sector. This amendment, if adopted, supports the market for clean energy technology in China's admittedly booming economy. I believe this amendment would pass the Senate. I think it would command a decided majority in the Senate, if left to its own merits. Sales of such clean technology helps U.S. firms, of course, but also provide a mechanism for the Chinese to improve their air and water quality, a necessary step if China is ever to step up to what should be leadership role for her among the world's developing nations with regard to climate change. 
   Now I am all for dealing with global warming. I am for the Kyoto Protocols, if China will get on board. So why not have an amendment to that effect. Let's have a vote here in the Senate. 
   After all, by the year 2015 at the latest, China is expected--let's see, I will be serving in my tenth term; that will be my tenth term. After all, by 2015 at the latest, China is expected to surpass the United States as the world's leading emitter of greenhouse gases. For her own sake, as well as for the future of all of us, China needs to step up to the plate and tackle her role in addressing the global issue of climate change. The United States would also benefit from this effort, as increased volume of clean technology sales helps to reduce prices and make the best technology more affordable to retrofit on existing U.S. facilities. 
   My other amendments are perhaps somewhat more specific in nature. In light of China's less-than-sterling record of abiding by previous trade agreements, these amendments are focused on increasing the transparency of Chinese Government subsidies made to China's many state-owned enterprises, and on improving existing U.S. procedures for acting on dumping complaints. China has made vague promises about not dumping and about not providing unfair subsidies to her enterprises. Yet China has also staked a verbal claim to the status of developing nations, which would exempt her from any sanctions with regard to subsidies made to Chinese industries. My amendments would require reports on China's state-owned enterprises--what's wrong with that?--and the advantages they enjoy, which would better enable us to determine if China's actions are fair. 
   Another of my amendments would add certainty to the sometimes excessively lengthy process used to determine if such subsidies have adversely affected U.S. companies and U.S. workers. These amendments will help us better to protect American manufacturers, American jobs, American workers, and 
   American families from unfair trade practices. 
   American trade negotiators have crowed that, in the U.S.-China Bilateral Trade Agreement, the United States has given up nothing, while the Chinese have made substantial concessions and have offered to significantly lower tariff rates on certain goods. But I argue that the United States is giving up something substantial, though not directly through the U.S.-China Bilateral Trade Agreement. We are making our part of the bargain now. We are giving up our annual review and extension of normal trade relations with China in favor of a permanent normal trade relations status. And we are doing it now, before China has to make a single concession as a result of the bilateral agreement, which, like PNTR, is contingent upon China's accession to the WTO. But I suspect that the Chinese may also be gambling on the fact that having once made the plunge in granting PNTR to China, the United States will give it to them even if they never make it to the WTO, or even if the details of the bilateral change are ignored. That is the way we are, and the Chinese know it as well as I do. 
   We have an obligation to our constituents and to the citizens of our great Nation to look out for their best interests. The Constitution gives us a role. Yes, it does. This is the Constitution that I hold in my hand for all to see through that electronic eye. This is the Constitution. Article I, section 8 gives Congress the power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce. So why don't we utilize that power? Why don't we utilize it? The Constitution gives us a role in regulating foreign commerce. I am not sure that we perform that obligation very well. We grant--I don't--fast-track authority to the Executive to negotiate massive trade deals and leave ourselves without the ability to amend. We take away the Senate's right under the Constitution to amend. We grant fast-track authority to the Executive to negotiate massive trade deals and leave ourselves without the ability to amend them, as we did with NAFTA and GATT, both of which I voted against--proudly, I voted against both. 
   My State certainly did not benefit from those actions. West Virginia lost  jobs and lost a lot of the diversity in its manufacturing base. China is an enormous potential market, perhaps, but she is also an enormous labor pool competing for jobs and competing at a price advantage. Our economy is strong, but we cannot all sit at computer keyboards and be information age technology wizards. As a Nation, we also need to actually make things and grow things. Production and farming are important. But I would not invest in planting a new apple orchard right now, with Chinese apples and apple juice flooding the U.S. market. I would think twice about establishing a new assembly plant or some factory right now that faces competition from lower-paid workers in China, who do not have the same labor protections that workers in the United States enjoy and deserve. The future is uncertain and cloudy. 
   Who will get the prize? Chinese or American workers? Will China be rewarded despite a history of broken trade agreements, weapons proliferation, religious repression, poor labor protection, and aggressive foreign policy statements? Will China be rewarded before the final trade issues concerning subsidies have been inked in? Or will American workers enjoy a respite? Will American concerns for security, human rights, and fair trade hold sway for a little while longer? I say to my colleagues, let it wait. Let it wait. This debate, this vote, can wait until we have the leisure and the will to do it right. If we persist in this misguided charade of a debate with no intention of considering any amendments on their merits, I will fulfill my obligations. I will offer amendments--good amendments, useful amendments, not dilatory amendments. I hope they will not be tabled simply to avoid a vote up or down, to avoid going to conference. 
   At this time, I believe it would be extremely unwise to simply rubber stamp the House bill and approve PNTR with China without amendments. 
   Granting PNTR to China with no amendments and no conditions signals that the U.S. Congress has given up on putting worker rights and environmental standards on the international trade agenda. Coupled with the rhetoric of the President, the Vice President, and the U.S. Trade Representative in support of PNTR, congressional acquiescence will reduce American credibility on labor and environmental issues to virtually nothing. 
   At this time, it is not known whether China will actually apply for membership in the WTO. But one thing is clear; the Chinese Government has not wavered in its absolute opposition to any consideration of labor rights and social standards in the WTO. Despite claims that a market economy is bringing democracy to China, the U.S. State Department's 1999 human rights report on China concludes that the Chinese Government's ``poor human rights record deteriorated markedly throughout the year, as the government intensified efforts to suppress dissent, particularly organized dissent.'' 
   Documented human rights violations include torture and mistreatment of prisoners, forced detentions, denial of due process, and extra-judicial killings. Violent repression of all efforts to organize independent union activity continues. 
   Given such a record, it would seem unbelievable to many that the United States Congress would grant a green light to PNTR with China, without so much as even a nod toward conditions or amendments. 
   Are we to turn a blind eye to every deeply held principle we have as a people about justice, freedom, and right and wrong for the pie-in-the sky promises of economic gain? I hope not. For that would be much, much more than a sell-out. That would be a shame. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very distinguished senior Senator from the State of Alexander Hamilton, New York. Alexander Hamilton was the only one of the New York delegation who finally signed the Constitution. He was one of the truly great statesmen in the early life of this Republic. He helped guide the people of that delegation at the Convention to a resolution concerning this great document, and one who helped, along with John Jay and James Madison, to write those, if I might use the word, ``immortal'' papers, the Federalist Papers. He helped to win the approval of the State of New York for the Constitution. 
   There is no one with whom I would rather, very honestly, discuss this particular subject in the Senate than the  Senator from New York because I am so opposed to the view that he has just expressed. I am so opposed to it. I could with much greater passion say that if it were someone else. 
   I respect the Senator. I admire him. I know he was and is the great teacher. I wish I had had the good fortune to sit in a class and listen to Senator MOYNIHAN speak as a Professor. 
   I am proud to say that I had much to do with Senator MOYNIHAN's being a member of the Finance Committee, as he also had to do with my becoming majority leader. 
   But I am very, very much opposed to this approach. I am very, very much opposed to and somewhat chagrined and disappointed, I say with due apologies to my friend, 
   at the philosophy which seems to govern the Senate at the moment with respect to this legislation, with respect to not adopting amendments. 
   The distinguished Senator has had no hesitancy whatever. He is not doing something behind closed doors or under the table or under the desk, but sitting it on front of the desk: This we are doing and this is why we are doing it. 
   He honestly believes that is the best for his country. I admire that. I respect the Senator for that forthrightness. He would not be otherwise but forthright. I respect his reasons, therefor. However, I cannot agree with him. I am totally, absolutely, unchangeably, unalterably set in my viewpoint that this is not the right thing to do; it is not in accordance with the Constitution of the United States; it is not in accordance with the wishes, the intentions of the framers. So be it. I am not going to argue that point. We will just disagree and be as great friends as we have ever been. And the Senator will win when we cast our final vote on this. His conscience will be clear and mine will be clear. 
   My State has lost under these trade agreements--GATT. Our country has lost under NAFTA. It is my understanding that we have lost 440,000 workers in this country as a result of NAFTA. Those are the statistics my staff has been able to get from the administration. 
   As I say, I will not belabor the point further. I thank the distinguished Senator for leadership that he has given the Senate. He is a man who has always enjoyed the respect of his colleagues whether he agrees or disagrees in a particular matter. He doesn't go out of this Chamber and carry it with him. We all love him, and we will all hate to see him go. But I will say to him, of his illustrious words that have been spoken in the Senate so many times, I have very carefully listened to them, and they will never dim from my memory.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I commend the Senate's guest Chaplain today, Father Thomas S. Acker, S.J., for his eloquent prayer opening today's session of the United States Senate. 
   For the last 18 years, Fr. Acker has been serving as President of Wheeling Jesuit University in Wheeling, West Virginia. 
   During that time, Wheeling Jesuit University has grown to become one of the leading universities in the State of West Virginia, and much of that growth is due to the insight and hard work of this Jesuit priest. During Fr. Acker's tenure at Wheeling Jesuit, the enrollment has doubled--doubled--and the number of buildings and square footage on campus has more than doubled. The addition of the Robert C. Byrd National Technology Transfer Center, the Erma Ora Byrd Center for Educational Technologies, and the Alan B. Mollohan Challenger Learning Center on campus places Wheeling Jesuit University in a unique position for growth into the 21st Century, which will begin next year, and has made a difference in the lives of the residents of West Virginia and beyond.  
   Recently, Fr. Acker was presented, by Administrator Dan Goldin, with the Distinguished Public Service Medal of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, the highest honor given to a civilian from that agency. This award reflects the high confidence that NASA and its Administrator have in the stewardship of Fr. Acker in connection with agency programs administered--where? at Wheeling Jesuit University. 
   Fr. Acker, a native of Cleveland, Ohio, entered the Jesuit order in 1947. 
   That was my first year in the West Virginia House of delegates. He has a Ph.D. in biology. I don't have a Ph.D. in anything. But I have grandsons who have Ph.Ds. I have two grandsons who have Ph.D.s in physics; not political science but physics. But Fr. Acker has a 
   Ph.D. in Biology from Stanford University. He has taught at John Carroll University. He has taught at the University of Detroit. He has taught at San Francisco University. He has served as Dean of Arts and Sciences at St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and worked in the country of Nepal, first as a Fulbright professor and then as Project Director of the U.S. Peace Corps. 
   Fr. Tom Acker's tenure as the President at Wheeling Jesuit University will end on Monday, July 31, 2000, the last year of the 20th century, but he will not be leaving the State of West Virginia. He has grown to love that State. Rather, he will remain in West Virginia, working in the southern sector to continue his great service to the great State of West Virginia. 
   I look forward to my continued relationship with this strong, competent, and compassionate man of the cloth, and I congratulate him on his decision to remain in West Virginia. 
   I listened carefully to his prayer today. He used the words, ``In God We Trust.'' I was in the House of Representatives in 1954, on June 7, when the House of Representatives passed legislation to include the words ``under God'' in the pledge of allegiance--June 7, 1954; ``under God.'' There are some people in this country who would like to take those words out of that pledge, but not Fr. Acker. I don't think anybody here in the Senate would be for that. That was June 7, 1954. 
   June 7, 1955, 1 year to the day, the House of Representatives voted to include the words ``In God We Trust,'' to have those words, as the national motto, put on all coins and all currency of the United States. Those words were already on some of the coins, but on June 7, 1955, the House of Representatives voted to have the words ``In God We Trust''--there they are-- ``In God We Trust,'' have that as the national motto and have those words on the coins and currency of the United States. 
   I was in the House on both occasions. I am the only person in Congress today who was in Congress when we voted to include the words ``under God'' in the Pledge of Allegiance. I thank our visiting minister today for his use of those words. 
   He also used the same words from the scriptures that Benjamin Franklin used in the Constitutional Convention in 1787 when the clouds of dissension and despair held like a pall over the Constitutional Convention. Everything was about to break up. They were having a lot of dissension, I say to the Senator from Nevada and the Senator from Florida. They were not agreeing on very many things. They were very discouraged. But Benjamin Franklin stood to his feet and suggested there be prayer at the convention, and he used those scriptures in his statement:  
   Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.  
   Thank you, Father Acker, for using those words and for having as the theme of your prayer this morning ``In God We Trust.'' Thank you. 
   I thank our Chaplain also, and I thank you, again, Father Acker. We hope you will enjoy your work in southern West Virginia. We are privileged to have you in my part of the State finally, southern West Virginia. My part is the whole State. We thank you, and may God bless you.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have had discussions with my own leader about PNTR and about getting on with appropriations bills. We had several discussions. I have had discussions with the minority leader's floor staff as to whether or not we could get back on those two appropriations bills, energy and water and Treasury-Postal Service. That was the reason why I wanted to know what had happened when I went off the floor, because I have had these several discussions. I had not finally agreed to this. The agreement that has been entered into, I had not finally agreed to that because I wanted some definite understandings about Treasury-Postal Service and energy and water before I agreed.

I hope we will push for that because I don't want to have the same old problems we have been having with appropriations bills; namely, to get down to conference and, at the last minute, Senators have plane reservations to go home and the administration comes in and is represented in the conference, and we have our backs to the walls and we end up  with one major bill, as we did in fiscal year 1999, with eight appropriations bills and one tax bill, a $9.2 billion tax bill--all on an unamendable conference report, and we don't know what it is all about, it has 3,980 pages in it, and we can't amend it. 
   That is a poor way to legislate. If the people of these United States knew what was going on here in that kind of a situation, they would run us all out, or they ought to. I just don't want to have that occur again.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will vote against the cloture motion to proceed to the China Permanent Normal Trade Relations bill. 
   The very nature of the discussions that have been taking place on the China PNTR issue demonstrates the complexity of trade, national security, democratic and economic issues that this nation faces in considering U.S.-China relations. One of my greatest concerns about the passage of PNTR for China is the very intensive scurrying to neatly package this deal as a ``win'' for America. 
   I will concede that, on one hand, supporters of the PNTR legislation can make legitimate claims that China has, indeed, stated that it is willing to cut its tariffs, to allow greater foreign investment, and to abide by a set of internationally approved trade rules. Certainly, the people of the United States of America embrace the hope that China and the Chinese people can enjoy a beneficial exchange of commerce. But, I am a devout believer in the principle of fair trade--I repeat fair trade--rather than the so-called free trade, and I must note that China's track record in adhering to agreements is much less than perfect. 
   I have little doubt that the vote today paves the way to rush to approve the PNTR measure without the deliberate, thoughtful consideration that this Congress should always provide. It has been years since this body gave U.S. trade policy the kind of consideration that we ought and that it certainly deserves. The Congress must not continue to neglect its duty to provide meaningful debate on U.S. trade policy that could plant the seeds of lasting, mutually beneficial trade relations with China. 
   But, I will save my concerns about the China PNTR issue for the actual debate. The debate today is simply on the motion to proceed. Nevertheless, all Senators should be put on notice that this vote is about allowing the Senate to begin a hasty consideration of one of the most economically important relationships of our time, which also has huge national security implications. U.S.-China relations deserve better consideration from the body charged by the Constitution, as outlined in Article I, Section 8, with regulating commerce with foreign nations.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I simply cannot understand what is going on here. I wish someone would tell me. I think we had a unanimous vote a little earlier here on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the consideration of the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill. 
   Why don't we vote? Why don't we vote? 
   As the ranking member on the Appropriations Committee, I can say to my colleagues that Senator TED STEVENS and I--the chairman and I--and the various chairmen and ranking members of the subcommittees on Appropriations have worked hard--have worked hard--to bring these appropriations bills to the Senate floor. We need  to get on with acting on these appropriations bills so that we can send them to the President. 
   I can tell you what is going to happen. I have seen it happen all too often in recent years. We don't get the appropriations bills down to the President one by one, so that he can sign them or veto them, which he has a right to do. What we do is delay and delay and delay. As a result, when the time comes that the leaders and Senators have their backs to the wall, and there is a big rush on to finalize the work so Senators can go home and the Senate can adjourn sine die, then everything is crammed into one big bill, one omnibus bill. 
   I am telling you, you would be amazed at what happens in the conferences. You would be amazed to see what occurs in those conferences. Entire bills are sometimes put into the conference report--entire bills, bills that may or may not have passed either House. And the administration is there also. The executive branch has its representatives there. They are there for the purpose of getting administration measures or items that the executive branch wants put into those conference reports. The items may not have had a word of debate in either House. Neither House will have had an opportunity to offer amendments on bills or to debate measures, and yet those measures will be put, lock, stock, and barrel, into the conference reports. 
   Then the conference report comes back to the Senate, where Senators cannot vote on amendments to that conference report. So Senators, as a result, have no opportunity to debate these matters that are crammed into the conference reports in those conferences. They will have had no opportunity to debate them. They will have had no opportunity to amend them. They will have had no opportunity to vote on parts thereof. 
   Yet Senators in this Chamber are confronted, then, with one package, and you take it or you leave it. You vote for it or you vote against it. 
   We have experienced that on a number of occasions. When we were considering the fiscal year 1997 appropriations, we had a conference report on the Defense Appropriations Bill and five additional appropriations bills were crammed into that conference report in conference, five appropriations bills. I believe two of them had never been taken up in the Senate. I believe two of them had had some debate, had been brought up, but had not been finally acted upon. 
   I intend at a future time to have all of this material researched so I can speak to it. Today, I recall there were five appropriations bills crammed into that conference report on the DOD Appropriations Bill. It was brought back to the Senate where Senators were unable to amend it and have votes on parts of it. And if Senators think that was bad, in fiscal year 1999, eight different appropriations bills were put into the final omnibus package. In addition thereto, a tax bill was put into that package in the conference. I believe that tax bill involved about $9.2 billion. That was put into the conference report. It had never had a day, an hour, or a minute of debate in this Senate. There were no amendments offered to it. Eight appropriations bills and a tax bill were all wrapped into one conference report in FY 1999, tied with a little ribbon, and Senators were confronted with having to vote for or against, that conference report--take it or leave it! 
   That was right at the end of the session when many Senators wanted to go home. They had town meetings scheduled; they wanted to go home. When that kind of circumstance arises, we are faced with a situation of having to vote on a bill that may contain thousands of pages which we have not had an opportunity to read. As I remember, there were 3,980 pages in that conference report. Imagine that. If the people back home knew what we were doing to them, they would run us all out of town on a rail. And we would be entitled to that honor, the way we do business here. All we do is carry on continual war in this body, continual war, each side trying to get the ups on the other side. It isn't the people's business we are concerned with. It is who can get the best of whom in the partisan battles that go on in this Chamber. 
   A lot of new Members come over from the House where they are accustomed, I suppose, to being told by their leaders what to do and how to do. Others come here fresh from the stump. I suppose they feel this is the way it has always been done. They don't know how it used to be done. They don't know that there was a day when we used to have conferences, and it was the rule that only items could be discussed in conference which had passed one or the other of the two bodies. Nothing could be put into a conference report that had not had action in one or the other of the two bodies. Otherwise, a point of order would lie against it. 
   I can assure you, those of you who are not on the Appropriations Committee, you ought to see what goes on in the conferences. Bills that have never passed either body, measures that have never passed either body, measures, in many instances, which are only wanted by the administration, are brought to that conference and are crammed into that conference report. The conference report comes back to the Senate. It is unamendable, and we have to take it or leave it. That is no way to do business. 
   I regret that it has come to this, and we are getting ready 
   to do it again. I see the handwriting on the wall. 
   Those of you who have read the book of Daniel will remember Belshazzar having a feast with 1,000 of his lords. They drank out of the vessels that had been taken from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon. And as they were eating and drinking and having fun, Belshazzar saw a hand appear over on the wall near the candlestick. And he saw the handwriting: mene, mene, tekel, upharsin. So he sent for his wise men, his astrologers, and wanted them to tell him what this writing meant. They couldn't do it. But the Queen told Belshazzar that there was a young man in the kingdom who could indeed unravel this mystery. As a result, Daniel was sent for. He told the King what was meant by the handwriting on the wall: ``God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it. Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and the Persians.'' And that night, Belshazzar was slain and the Medes and the Persians took the kingdom. 
   I see the handwriting on the wall: mene, mene, tekel, upharsin. I see the handwriting. We have voted unanimously in this body today to proceed to take up the appropriations bill making appropriations for the Department of Treasury-Postal Service and so forth, but we are not going to vote on that. I have asked questions around: When are we going to vote? There is no intention to vote on that today. We have another cloture vote coming up within a few minutes. If that cloture motion is approved, the Senate will then take on that subject, and the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill will go back to the calendar. We are not going to take it up. There is no intention of voting on that bill, no intention. It will go back on the calendar. 
   Then what will happen? I see the handwriting on the wall. We will go to conference one day when we get back from the August recess. We will go to conference one day on another appropriations bill, and everything will go on that appropriations bill. I wish Daniel were here today so he could tell me exactly what the handwriting on this wall really means, but I think I know what it means. It means this bill isn't going to see the light of day until after the recess, and probably not then. In all likelihood, the Treasury-Postal Service bill will be put on a conference report, maybe on the legislative appropriations bill. This bill will go on that. As time passes, more and more appropriations bills will likely go on that in conference. 
   So we will get another conference report back here that is loaded--loaded--with appropriations bills. We won't know what is in them. We Senators won't know what is in those bills. We didn't know what was in the 3,980-page conference report in fiscal year 1999. We voted for it or against it blindly. I voted against it. I didn't know what was in it. That is what we are confronted with. 
   The American people, I think, are going to write us off as being irrelevant. We don't mean anything. We just stay here and fight one another and try to get the partisan best of one another.  Democrats versus Republicans, Republicans versus Democrats. Who can get the ups on the other side. The people will say we can go to hell. That is the attitude here. Hell is not such a bad word. I have seen it in the Bible, so I perhaps will not be accused of using bad language here. But that is what we are in for. That is the handwriting on the wall. We are going to replay the same old record and have these monumental conference reports come back here, unamendable, and we take them hook, line, and sinker, one vote. No amendments. We won't know what is in the bill. 
   How is that for grown up men and women? We won't know what is in the bill because we are playing politics all the time. We are playing politics. That is why we are not getting our work done. I am not blaming that side or this side. I am just blaming both sides. We are all caught in this. I am sure the American people can't look at this body, or this Congress, and get much hope because we play politics all the time. I am sorry that things have come to this. But Congress doesn't work by the rules; the Senate doesn't operate under the rules it operated under when I came here and that existed up until a few years ago. This game has been going on and it is getting worse. It is getting worse. 
   Mr. President, I don't intend to hold the floor any longer. I will have more to say about this. If you want to know the truth, what is said is exactly the truth. We are absolutely working a fraud on the American people. They look to this body and expect us to legislate on the problems of the country, and we are just tied in knots. We only seem to think about partisanship. I am sick and tired of that. I am sure we have to have a little of that as we go along, but it has become all partisan politics. Who can win this? If they come up with something, we have to come up with an alternative. 
   I don't think the American people want that. I think they know more than we think they know, and I believe they are pretty aware of what is going on. We are just playing politics. That is exactly why we can't get this Treasury-Postal Service Appropriations Bill up and get it passed and send it to conference. Mark my words; we are going to play the same old game over and over again that we have played all too many times now, not passing appropriations bills, but having them all in conference put into one monumental, colossal conference report, and it is sent back here and we will vote on it and we won't know what is in the conference report. Shame! Shame on us! 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, over the past month and a half, a brightly lit torch has made its journey through nineteen cities, carrying with it each step of the way the passionate and able spirit of the disability community. Today the torch arrives at its 20th stop along the way, our Nation's Capital, to mark the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act. It is indeed an important day in our Nation's long history. 
   President Franklin Roosevelt once said, ``No country, no matter how rich, can afford to waste its human resources.'' I am proud to say that the Americans with Disabilities Act lives up to President Roosevelt's objective. For 10 years now, this momentous, landmark civil rights legislation has opened new doors to the disability community. It has, at long last, allowed handicapped individuals the opportunity and the access to have their potential recognized both inside the workplace and outside in the community. It has brought the American dream within reach for the millions of American families with disabled members. 
   Over the past decade of the ADA, we have seen dramatic changes throughout the nation in equal opportunity--from new and advanced technology allowing for greater public accommodation at places of business and in commercial establishments, to state and local government services and activities, to transportation and telecommunications technology for disabled Americans. Look around today--people with disabilities are participating to a far greater extent in their communities and are living fuller, more productive lives as students, workers, family members, and neighbors. They are dining out; cheering at football games and other sporting events, often even playing sports themselves; going to the movies; participating in state, local, and Federal Government; and raising families of their own. 
   It is evident that that the capability of this community far outshines the challenges of a disability. I am proud that the ADA has been particularly instrumental in removing many of the barriers that would otherwise impede the ability and success of the disability community. Take the example of Casey Martin, the professional golfer from Orgeon with a rare disability that substantially limits one's ability to walk.  Casey had long dreamed of playing in a PGA tour, but, because of his disability, Casey encountered a huge barrier. In these tournaments in which Casey wanted to play, the tour would not allow the use of a golf cart. When a Federal trial court in Oregon found that the PGA tour is a ``public accommodation'' and should modify their policy of no golf carts to accommodate Casey's disability, his vision became a reality. According to Casey, ``Without the ADA I never would have been able to pursue my dream of playing golf professionally.'' 
   While for Casey Martin the ADA has meant achieving his most far-reaching goal, for other disabled Americans, the ADA has simply allowed them to live each new day with a little more ease and comfort. To name just a few areas in which the ADA has facilitated progress--access to restaurants and public restrooms, modifications to the aisles and entrances of supermarkets, assistive listening systems at places like Disney World and many theaters for the deaf and hard of hearing, and large print financial statements for those with vision impairments. Mr. President, these are the kind of simplicities in life that those without disabilities expect and take for granted, and because of the ADA, they have now come to be a part of the disability community's life too. 
   Just as the barriers that continue to face each of us in life take many years to craft, they take many years to conquer. Together, we must find the strength and the courage to pick our battles. I commend the disability community today on their passion and their vigilance, and I celebrate with you on this 10th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act for all that this day has brought to your community, and for all that it will continue to bring in the years ahead. Let today recommit each of us to the ADA for all Americans.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today, as the Senate recalls the tragic loss two years ago of two fine Capitol Police Officers, Officer Jacob J. Chestnut and Detective John M. Gibson, our hearts also bear fresh bruises from the loss of a Senator and a former Senator. 
   Mr. President, on Saturday I traveled with several other Senators to Atlanta, GA, to attend the funeral of our late Senate colleague, Paul Coverdell. Senator Coverdell's departure from this life had been sudden. It had come without warning. Paul was only 61 and he could look forward to many fruitful years of service to the Nation and to his people. But it was not to be. The Scriptures tell us:  
   As for man, his days are as grass; as a flower of the field, So he flourishes. For the wind passes over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.  
   On Wednesday of last week, I journeyed to Rhode Island with several other Senators to pay our last respects to a late departed former colleague, John O. Pastore, and to commiserate with his bereaved family and a great host of friends. We said the last goodbye to a man who had given much to the service of his country and who had retired from this body 26 years ago. A great throng paid homage to the remembrance of one whom they loved and who had served them so well, as was the case with our beloved late colleague, Paul Coverdell. There was a great throng, a large church filled to overflowing. 
   In both instances to which I have just referred, the choirs sang beautifully, the eulogies came forth from wounded hearts, the final farewells were spoken; then the crowds departed, and each person went on his or her own way to family hearth and home. 
   Over a long life of more than 80 years I have traveled this same journey many times. It is always the same. We travel the last mile with a departed friend and we come to the end of the way, when we can go no farther. That is as far as we can go. There we must part forever--insofar as this earthly life is concerned. From there, the loved one must go on alone, to ``The undiscovered country,'' as Shakespeare said, ``from whose bourne no traveler returns''. 
   So it is, and so it has been since the very beginning of our race, and so it will be in all the years to come. We are here today, and gone tomorrow. The clock of life is wound but once, And no man has the power to know just when the clock will strike, At late or early hour. Now is the only time you have, so live, love, work with a will; Put no faith in tomorrow for the clock may then be still.  
   Mr. President, John Pastore lived to be the ripe old age of 93; for Paul Coverdell, the grim reaper beckoned earlier, and the end came at 61. For those of us who remain on this side of the vale of trials and tears, the message from both of these lives is clear: be ready, be ready to go. William Cullen Bryant said it for you and for me:  
   All that breathes will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh when thou art gone, the solemn brood of care plod on, and each one as before will chase his favorite phantom; .....  
   As one who has lived in this town of inflated egos for nearly half a century, I can testify that William Cullen Bryant had it right. I have seen the great, the near great, those who thought they were great, those who would never become great, and each incoming wave of life's sea surges forward on the sands of humanity's rocky coast, and then, just as quickly recedes into the vast emptiness of the past. But what cannot be washed away is the love and the memory of man's deeds and service to his fellowman. 
   So, each of us will carry within ourselves the memory of Senator Pastore's, Senator Coverdell's, Officer Chestnut's, and Detective Gibson's deeds and service to his fellow man. They have touched all of us, and we have been changed by them, because it was Tennyson who said, ``I am part of all that I have met.'' And so, in this small way, they live on in our hearts and in our dedication to do good with the hours and days that remain to us. The poet John Donne expressed it well, how each man's life--and each man's death--touches ours:  
   No man is an island, entire of itself; 
   Every man is a piece of the continent, 
   A part of the main; 
   If a clod be washed away by the sea, 
   [America] is the less, 
   As well as if a promontory were, 
   As well as if a manor of thy friend's 
   Or of thine own were; 
   Any man's death diminishes me, 
   Because I am involved in mankind; 
   And therefore 
   Never send to know for whom the bell tolls: 
   It tolls for thee. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on Wednesday, the day before yesterday, I went with a delegation to the State of Rhode Island for the funeral of our former colleague, John O. Pastore. I was accompanied by Senators JACK REED and LINCOLN CHAFEE of Rhode Island, TED KENNEDY and JOHN KERRY of Massachusetts, PATRICK LEAHY of Vermont, and JOSEPH BIDEN of Delaware. Former Senators Claiborne Pell and Harris Wofford were also present. 
   The Catholic Mass at the Church of the Immaculate Conception was uplifting. John Pastore, Jr., and grandson, Gregory, spoke warmly of our former colleague. Senator TED KENNEDY was especially eloquent in his remembrance of Senator Pastore. It was obvious that this man was much beloved by his family and community. 
   Mr. President, I can recollect John Pastore's departing speech from the Senate. There he remarked that he had wanted to be a physician, but that his father had died when he was nine, and he had to help raise his four brothers and sisters and support his mother, who worked as a seamstress. How proud he must have been of his son, John, Jr., a Notre Dame graduate, a physician and cardiologist. So the son became what the father--John O. Pastore, the Senator--had wanted to be. 
   Instead of being a physician, Senator Pastore studied law at night at Boston's Northeastern University, eventually graduating with a Bachelor of Laws degree. This is an effort I can especially appreciate. At age 36, he became Governor of the State of Rhode Island, and was reelected twice before winning a Senate seat in 1950, where he served for 26 years. 
   Senator Pastore was a strong supporter of the National Defense establishment, with a great appreciation for the U.S. Navy--and especially the nuclear Navy. As the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, he was equally mindful of the power, and the terror, of all matters nuclear, and worked hard for passage of the first nuclear test ban treaty, which barred nuclear tests in the atmosphere. 
   John Pastore and I served for some 18 years together in the Senate. John was an effective and fiery orator. My recollection is that not many members were willing to take him on in a debate, because of his quick mind and fierce demeanor. Sometimes he would finish his debating points, leaving his opponent's arguments in shreds, and stride off the floor. But, even then he maintained his self-deprecating sense of humor--sometimes remarking under his breath, ``If I had been a foot taller, I would have been president.'' 
   Mr. President, I wonder why he would have wanted to be President. He was an extraordinary Senator. But he may well have become President had he wanted to do so. 
   He was the keynote speaker at the 1964 Democratic Convention. According to news reports, his 36-minute speech was interrupted by applause 36 times, and he enjoyed a brief consideration for the Vice-Presidential nomination that eventually went to Senator Hubert Humphrey. 
   John Pastore's priorities were love of, and dedicated service to, God, Country, and family--especially family. I am told that John had the desk in his office equipped with a special buzzer that rang out to alert him whenever Elena, his wife since 1941, would call. I am told that no matter how important a visitor he might have in his office even if it had been Admiral Rickover, if the buzzer went off John Pastore would interrupt his meeting to take the call from ``Mama''--as he affectionately referred to his wife--for a list of  groceries, perhaps, to pick up on the way home or some other domestic chore. After carefully writing down her instructions, he would turn to his visitor and resume the meeting. 
   John Pastore was the Chairman of the Communications Subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee. He was instrumental in the formation of legislation that created the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the Public Broadcasting Service. John Pastore was opposed to violence on television and, especially, in children's programming. The deterioration of TV programming to what it is today must have been upsetting to him. 
   John Pastore's commitment to God, to competence, and to compassion, set a high standard. He used these commitments, I believe, to promote justice and peace. He was so very proud that his son John, Jr., who served as secretary of the Boston-based International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985. 
   So on Wednesday, I took the opportunity along with my illustrious colleagues whom I have named, to extend, on behalf of the Senate, my sympathy and prayers to John's wife, Elena, his son, John, Jr., and his daughters, Francesca and Louise. 
   What a great outpouring that was on Wednesday--a huge church auditorium, and a great crowd. What a wonderful family. 
   I was so very impressed with Mrs. Pastore, by her grace and poise, and with the two daughters and with that son, John Jr., the physician, which John himself had wanted to be. 
   I close with words by John Donne: 
   Death Be Not Proud Death, be not proud, though some have called thee Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so; For those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow, Die not, poor Death; nor yet canst thou kill me, From Rest and Sleep, which but they picture be, Much pleasure, then from thee much more must flow; And soonest our best men with thee do go-- Rest of their bones and souls' delivery! Thou'rt slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men, And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell; And poppy or charms can make us sleep as well And better than thy stroke. Why swell'st thou then? One short sleep past, we wake eternally, And Death shall be no more: Death, thou shalt die!  
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last evening, the Senate completed action on the Fiscal Year 2001 appropriations bill for Agriculture, Rural Development, and Related Agencies. The bill was passed by a vote of 79 to 13. I commend Senator COCHRAN, Chairman of the Subcommittee, and Senator KOHL, the Ranking Member, for crafting this very important legislation. 
   This bill includes many ongoing programs that are vital to the American people. It also includes a number of items to deal directly with problems that our farmers and rural residents are facing this year as they struggle to recover from natural disasters last year, and are now faced with the reality of continuing drought. 
   Overall, in Division A, the bill provides a total of $75.6 billion in non-emergency spending for fiscal year 2001. Of that amount, a little more than $60 billion is for mandatory programs, such as Food Stamps and reimbursements to the Commodity Credit Corporation which funds a wide array of commodity, conservation, and international trade programs. The balance of the non-emergency appropriations in this bill, $14.8 billion, is directed toward discretionary programs and represents an increase of nearly $900 million above last year's level. In addition to the $75.6 billion in Division A of the bill, Division B, as passed by the Senate, contains approximately $2.2 billion in emergency agricultural disaster assistance for the nation's farmers and rural communities. I will discuss these vital programs in more detail later in these remarks. 
   America's farmers have made this nation the breadbasket of the world. Our ability to produce plentiful safe, wholesome, and nutritious food is one of the basic foundations of economic and national security. The term ``food security'' may be little more than a vague concept to most, unfortunately not all, Americans; but in much of the world, it is an everyday reminder of the struggle to survive. The prosperity and the fate of nations throughout the history of the world are closely tied to their agricultural production capabilities. When the fields of Carthage were sown with salt by the legions of Rome, that once-great nation of northern Africa soon disappeared into the sands of the Sahara. 
   This appropriations bill includes many of the tools American farmers need to sustain their historically high levels of production. Research, conservation, credit, and many more items important to agriculture receive much-needed funding in this bill. Programs to promote exports of U.S. agricultural products throughout the world are included in this bill. American producers, and consumers alike, benefit from the work of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, and we should all join in supporting their efforts. 
   Agriculture exists in every part of the nation, and every Senator knows the important contributions farmers make to his or her state. When one thinks of farming, instant images of broad, flat fields of wheat or corn, spreading from horizon to horizon, easily come to mind. Visions of combines combing the Great Plains and of massive grain elevators reaching to Midwestern skies are a solid part of our national consciousness. But farming does not only exist in the flat plains of Kansas or the rolling hills of Iowa or in many of the other states most familiar to Americans as ``Farm Country.'' Agriculture exists in the tropics of Hawaii and the bogs of Maine. Agriculture exists in the orchards of the Pacific Northwest and in the groves of Florida. Agriculture even extends to the vegetable fields and reindeer herds of my Chairman's state, Alaska. 
   West Virginia is not famous as an agricultural state, but West Virginia agriculture is changing to meet the new demands of consumers. The future of agriculture includes diversification to meet the changing demands of consumers at home and abroad. Farmers in West Virginia, through the help of the Appalachian Farming Systems Research Center at Beaver, West Virginia, and the National Center for Cool and Cold Water Aquaculture at Leetown, West Virginia, are but two examples of the diversification of agriculture in my state and I am glad this bill provides increased funding for these two facilities. 
   In addition to the regular programs funded in this bill, I would also like to mention a few of the items included to address special problems farmers and rural residents have to face this year. Last year, Congress provided more than $8 billion in emergency funding to help farmers and rural areas respond to adverse weather and depressed commodity prices. This year, all indicators point to continuing drought conditions and prices for some commodities have fallen more than ever in history. 
   While it is important for Congress to respond to emergencies, it is equally, or perhaps more, important to prepare for them. Last year, many livestock producers in West Virginia suffered horrible losses from drought and, in many cases, had to liquidate their herds at depressed prices. Congress finally provided assistance to cover the  costs of feed, but in many cases the assistance was too little and, more tragically, too late. 
   Accordingly, I met with USDA Secretary Dan Glickman this spring and outlined for him my plan to put in place a program that will help prevent a repeat of some of the losses suffered by West Virginia farmers and farmers all across America last year. The Secretary agreed that action now is proper to provide him the tools necessary to mitigate losses that are likely to occur this summer. While it is beyond the power of the Congress to overcome the awesome powers of nature, it is within our power, and our responsibility, to provide assistance to the American people in the most effective manner possible. Where the likelihood of drought is certain, where acts of prevention are possible, there lies our responsibility and I want to thank my colleagues for supporting an amendment I offered to put these preventive tools in place. 
   Pursuant to my amendment, this bill provides $450 million for livestock assistance this year in the event drought conditions continue to worsen. These funds will only be available in counties which receive an emergency designation by the President or the Secretary. In the event no 
   emergencies are designated, none of these funds will be spent. On the other hand, the ounce of prevention we provide in this bill may easily outweigh the costs producers, and possibly taxpayers, will later realize unless we act now to help mitigate losses that are likely to occur. 
   Drought conditions not only affect production agriculture, they drain water resources necessary for basic community services in rural areas. Currently, drought conditions in part of the nation are so severe that rural water systems are at risk from depleted supplies, wells will not function, and the increased demand for water have compounded this problem to the point of crisis. I am pleased that my amendment also provides $50 million for rural communities that are at-risk due to natural emergencies or due to threats to public health or the environment. Similar to the livestock provision mentioned above, a portion of these funds would be limited to counties which have received an emergency designation by the President or the Secretary and for applications responding to the specific emergency. 
   In addition to addressing problems related to drought, my amendment, as contained in this bill includes a number of other provisions. Included is $443 million to help dairy farmers recover from the current collapse in market prices. Also, $58 million is provided for compensation to producers from losses due to pests and disease such as Plum Pox, the Mexican Fruit Fly, Pierce's Disease, and Citrus Canker. 
   During floor consideration of the bill, a manager's package of some fifteen amendments was adopted to provide additional emergency agricultural assistance to farmers across the nation. That package of manager's amendments total approximately $1 billion, the largest portion of which, $450 million, will provide emergency assistance to producers who have suffered losses from recent natural disasters. This assistance will help offset losses from the heavy rains that recently affected more than one million acres of farmland in North Dakota, as well as losses in other parts of the country affected by drought. Additionally, $175 million was included to assist apple producers who have suffered from a combination of both market and quality losses; $40 million was provided to help compensate for losses due to citrus canker; $70 million was provided to fund emergency watershed operations in a number of states; an additional $50 million was included for community facility needs associated with losses from Hurricane Floyd and related storms; and the balance of items in this package will assist producers and rural communities across the nation in a variety of ways. 
   Overall, this bill strikes a good balance for providing funds to meet regular, ongoing needs and to prepare for problems that we are likely to experience later this year. I especially thank Senator STEVENS and Senator COCHRAN, Chairmen of the Appropriations Committee and the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, respectively, and all members of the Appropriations Committee for their support of provisions which I authored that will provide the Secretary of Agriculture the ability to meet the developing drought conditions this summer. By meeting this challenge head on, we will be helping producers avoid a repeat of some of the terrible losses incurred last year. I support this bill, and I urge all Senators to support this bill. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

As my friend from Michigan may know, the Interior subcommittee received over 2,000 Member requests for funding for particular projects, accounts or activities. It is not an easy task, of course, to strike a satisfactory balance between the thousands of requests on the one hand, and the subcommittee's limited resources on the other. However, I am aware that the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore is of great importance to the Senator from Michigan and the people he represents, and I was therefore pleased to be able to secure funding for the LaPorte land acquisition. I can also assure my friend that I will carefully consider his Barratt property request should additional resources become available later in the year.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, with final passage of the Fiscal Year 2001 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, I wish to take a moment to thank all Senators for their time and effort in helping to make this important measure a better product. As I have frequently noted, crafting the Interior bill is not an easy charge. Weighing the thousands of Member requests that come in to the Interior subcommittee against the limited resources made available to us is an arduous task, indeed. 
   Yet, this year, as in past years, that job has been handled with great skill by the subcommittee chairman, Senator GORTON. My friend from Washington is, I can say unequivocally, the best subcommittee chairman I have ever had the pleasure of working with. His dedication to duty, his graciousness under fire, and his commitment to working with me in a bipartisan manner are simply unparalleled. Moreover, the fact that this legislation will be adopted by the Senate by an overwhelming vote is testament, I believe, to the incredible job done by the distinguished subcommittee chairman. 
   Let me also extend my appreciation to all subcommittee staff, in particular, Bruce Evans, who serves Senator GORTON in an efficient and capable manner. And, on the minority side, I wish to offer a special thanks to Peter Kiefhaber. Although this young man has been on my staff for more than eight years, this is his first year working for the Appropriations Committee. In the span of less than 6 months, he has worked hard, distinguishing himself not only to me, but obviously to other Members of the Senate, who have told me personally of his good work. 
   Finally, let me again thank all Senators and say that I look forward to working with the subcommittee chairman as we proceed to conference with the House of Representatives.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the peace talks that President Clinton has been hosting at Camp David between Prime Minister Barak of Israel and Chairman Arafat of the Palestinian Authority appear to be reaching their climax. The President has made clear from the outset that the negotiations would be difficult, but that it was his hope to recreate the spirit of the Camp David summit hosted by President Carter more than 20 years ago that resulted in the historic peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. 
   The goal of the current discussions is no less ambitious than the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt that was enshrined in the first Camp David accords. Certainly, a peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians would be a welcome advance in the quest for a lasting peace in the Middle East. We would all like these discussions to lead to an end to the conflict that has caused so much suffering and instability in that troubled region. 
   Whether such a positive outcome is possible is still very much in doubt. There is no guarantee of success; indeed, many think the chances are dim. But when there is a chance for peace, the opportunity should be seized. 
   That being said, Mr. President, it should be made clear what the role and responsibility of the United States are here. The most important role of the United States is our ability to serve as the facilitator of these discussions. That is due to the nature of our relations with Israel and the Palestinians, and the personalities of the leaders involved at this time in history. 
   But providing a forum and encouragement for the Israelis and Palestinians to solve their own conflict should  not be translated into a commitment to solve the conflict for them. Stability in the Middle East, including the state of relations between Israel and the Palestinians, is a matter of great importance to the United States, but it is not our conflict. It is theirs. We can help them find common ground, but ultimately it is their ground to find. 
   This distinction is significant in light of the potential cost of a peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Figures ranging from $15 billion to $40 billion have been floated in the media over the past several days as the possible sums that U.S. taxpayers will be asked to contribute to a peace agreement. If history is any guide, this is only the beginning. 
   According to the Congressional Research Service, from 1979 through 2000, the United States has provided over $68 billion to Israel, and over $47 billion to Egypt to support the Camp David accords. That amounts to more than $115 billion in U.S. tax dollars to two countries alone. Besides that, from 1994 and 2000, the United States has provided $927 million--almost a billion dollars--to the Palestinians. 
   I wonder how many Americans are aware of this. I wonder how many Americans knew, at the time of the first Camp David summit, that the price of an Israeli-Egyptian peace agreement would be an open-ended financial commitment of U.S. tax dollars exceeding $100 billion. Yet after more than 20 years of paying the bills, that is indeed the cost. And there is no end in sight. 
   Mr. President, there has been a lot of talk about President Clinton's legacy and Secretary of State Albright's legacy. I appreciate their zeal to achieve historic agreements and to be remembered for their achievements. I recognize that peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians would be a crowning achievement. But what legacy at what price? Are we going to be told somewhere down the line that in order for the Israelis and Palestinians to agree--and this does not include the Syrians--the Administration had to promise them billions and billions of dollars in U.S. taxpayer aid? Why is it the responsibility of the United States Congress to pay to implement an agreement that we are not a party to, and about which we have, so far, received no details? 
   There is a disturbing tendency on the part of the Administration, and it is by no means unique to this Administration, to negotiate agreements and make costly financial commitments behind closed doors, and then inform the Congress, in so-called ``consultations,'' after the fact. I fear that is what is contemplated again, and I think it is wrong. 
   If consultations are happening, that is news to me. As ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I have not been consulted, and perhaps for good reasons. I am not aware of any other Senator who has been approached by any administration official who has suggested what the price of implementing a peace agreement might be, or why it is the responsibility of the American taxpayers to pay that price. I say this particularly when it was only last year that the Congress provided a total of $1.6 billion to Israel and the Palestinians to implement the Wye River agreement--another deal that was made without any prior consultations, as far as I know, with Congress. Again, I fear we are being led down the path of ``sign now, pay later'' without even knowing how much we are going to be asked to pay later, or why. 
   Now, I recognize that the discussions underway at Camp David may fail. There may be no agreement. That would be unfortunate. But whatever the outcome, I want to remind the administration, and the Israelis and Palestinians, that the negotiations are being hosted by the administration, not by the Congress, not by the Appropriations Committees of the Congress. No one should assume that the check is in the mail. No one should assume that we are going to dig another hole for ourselves the way we did the last time there was such a negotiation at Camp David. 
   We all want to see peace in the Middle East, and if there is a legitimate need for funding to implement a peace agreement, we can discuss what role the United States should play--but not after the commitments have already been made, not after the ink has already dried, not if this ancient Senator has anything to say about it. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the great English novelist, Charles Dickens, began his epic novel, ``A Tale of Two Cities,'' with these words, ``It was the best of times, it was the worst of– times. . . .'' 
   Well over a century later, and a continent away from the writing of Dickens' story, those words could well describe the plight of our nation in the last year of the 20th century. 
   That is this century--the last year of the 20th century. 
   The United States has never been more affluent, in terms of material wealth and creature comforts, or more impoverished in terms of spiritual well-being. It is the best of times materially. It is the worst of times spiritually. Millions are made daily on Wall Street, American consumerism fuels booming international economic and trade markets, and our Nation's living standard is the envy of the world. We have eliminated our staggering deficits at home, at least on paper, and jobs are available for our people in abundance. 
   Yet, America is, in many ways, a hollow nation. We are a people on the edge of a precipice. Despite all of our economic prosperity, despite all of our fascination with the glittery toys that money can buy us, despite all of the accouterments of success and prosperity, so envied by the rest of the world, all of the material comforts we so enthusiastically chase, can never pacify the hunger beginning to emerge in our collective souls, nor even start to solve the endemic problems which crowd the dark corners of our national psyche. 
   Our children randomly slaughter each other in our schools, clothes are torn off of innocent women in a public park, smut crowds the airwaves, the traditional family structure continues to deteriorate, advertising reflects little but sexual innuendo and the desire for a mad rush to some materialistic nirvana, song lyrics are not fit for polite company, and even the barest mention of the existence of a Creator is castigated as inappropriate or viewed as the unbalanced ravings of the lunatic fringe. 
   We are a people seemingly in deep denial of our own humanity--in deep denial of our own unquenched inner need for meaning and purpose and direction in our lives. We have succumbed to the glossy promise of more, and more, and more, in a vain and pointless effort to deny the one essential element which is so glaringly missing from our aimless, restless pursuit of prosperity. 
   Religion has all but vanished from our national life. Worse than that, religion is discouraged; religion is frowned upon. Religion is suppressed, spurred by what I believe is a misguided attempt to ensure a completely secular society and a gross misreading of constitutional intent. Oh, what ills are born when we forget our history! What ills are born when we forget our history! 
   This Nation was founded, in part, so that religion could freely flourish. The Constitution was written and ratified by men who possessed a strong spiritual awareness. These were not Godless men who wrote the Constitution of the United States. They had a spiritual awareness. The universal principles espoused in the Declaration of Independence in 1776, and other early American documents reflect aspirations, 
   which are, at their core, based on a belief in a Supreme Being and on the existence of a human soul. What are these if not religious principles? Such lofty and spiritual beliefs as the bedrock equality of all humans,--as the bedrock equality of all humans--and the endowment by a Creator of basic rights cannot be secularized out of existence in a nation so rooted in a deep spiritual consciousness as is ours. Every single value upon which this country was so painstakingly built--individual sacrifice for the greater good, fairness, charity, truthfulness, morality, personal responsibility, honesty--all of these are, at root, qualities derived from Judeo-Christian teachings. To try to separate this nation from the religious grounding which it so obviously exhibits in every aspect of its history, is like trying to bifurcate muscle from bone. Dysfunction is the result--sterile bone which cannot move, and useless tissue with no support. That is what happens when spiritual values become separated from our national life. 
   Nowhere are the results of such an unfortunate rending more obvious, more destructive or more heartbreaking than in the evident damage we have done to our most precious commodity, our children. Millions of our innocents are lost in a maze of drugs, cheap sex, violence, and materialism. They are starving--starving--for lessons by which to live their lives, and what do we offer them? We offer them only hedonistic baubles. Love of pleasure, greed, gratification of sex, deification of the crude and the outrageous, and the selfish culture of Me, me, me, and More, more, more, are no guidelines on which to build a life or a character whether it be a nation or the individual. These are only empty distractions that lead down roads previously reserved for misfits and criminals. We must look hard at ourselves in the mirror each morning and ask what in the name of God we are coming to if we continue on this course? We are all at fault, all of us--the clergy for not speaking out, the Church doesn't speak out like it used to when I was a boy. 
   The church took a strong stand on the great national issues. But the church, as so many of us, has been driven into a closet; so the clergy for not speaking out; the leaders of business in this country for looking only at profits; the leaders of both political parties for pandering--pandering. Most of the issues that plague us nationally--such as violence in our schools, inadequate health care for the weakest in our society, crime, greed in politics, all of these issues, all of them, are at their root--are issues of right and wrong, issues of morality. 
   Yet in order to avoid offending anyone--don't offend anyone; that is why so many of the colleges and schools have taken history out of the required courses, because history might offend somebody. It might offend some group--in order to avoid offending anyone or any group, we try to totally secularize our politics on the left and overly polarize our politics, with too much false piety, on the right. So both are in the wrong. The result is only endless power struggle and pandering to the various groups which keep us in power. As such, political power has become an end, not a means, and the leadership of this nation too often winds up pursuing solutions to the effects of our ills and ignoring their causes. 
   A prejudice against the influence of religious commitment and moral values upon political issues now characterizes almost every sector of American society from the media to law to academia. We have seen the Supreme Court rule, again and again, against allowing voluntary prayer in public school in this country. I believe that this ingrained predisposition against expressions of religious or spiritual beliefs is wrongheaded, destructive, and completely contrary to the intent of the Founders of this great nation. Instead of ensuring 
   freedom of religion in a nation founded in part to guarantee that basic liberty, a literal suffocation of that freedom has been the result. The rights of those who do not believe in a Supreme Being have been zealously guarded, to the denigration, I repeat, denigration, of the rights of those who do so believe. 
   The American doctrine of separation of church and state--and you don't find that in the Constitution; it says nothing about separation of Church and State in the Constitution--forbids the establishment of any one religion by the state, but not, I repeat, not the influence of religious values in the life of the nation. Religious faith has always been an underpinning of American life. 
   One of the most perceptive of observers of the early American scene was Alexis de Tocqueville. Writing in the 1830's on his observations while traveling in America, de Tocqueville grasped the moral content of America. Coming from France where abuse of power by the clergy had made  anticlericalism endemic, he was amazed to find it virtually unknown in America. 
   De Tocqueville writes:  
   In France, I had almost always seen the spirit of religion and the spirit of freedom marching in opposite directions, but in America, I found they were intimately united, and that they reigned in common over the same country. . . . Religion . . . must be regarded as the first of their political institutions . . . .  
   He is talking about Americans in the 1830s. Let me say that again--DeTocqueville:  
   Religion . . . must be regarded as the first of their political institutions; for if it does not impart a taste for freedom, it facilitates the use of it.  
   He concluded that most Americans held religion,  
   to be indispensable to the maintenance of Republican institutions.  
   John Adams was the second President of the United States. He served as Vice President for 8 years under George Washington. He was a member of the Continental Congress, and a signer of the Declaration of Independence. He greatly influenced the States to ratify the new Constitution by writing a three-volume work, entitled, ``A Defense of the Constitutions of the Government of the United States.'' 
   I like to go back to John Adams' work from time to time and just read it again. I recommend it to our people who are listening in this Chamber. One might say that, when it came to building the governmental structure of these United States, John Adams was in on the ground floor. In his diary entry dated February 22, 1756, John Adams wrote--listen to John Adams now:  
   Suppose a nation in some distant region should take the Bible for their only law book, and every member should regulate his conduct by the precepts there exhibited! Every member would be obliged in conscience to temperance, frugality, and industry; to justice, kindness, and charity towards his fellow men; and to piety, love, and reverence toward Almighty God . . . . What a Utopia, what a Paradise would this region be.  
   That was John Adams. Obviously, John Adams believed that moral precepts and Biblical teachings would be an ideal foundation on which to lay the government of a great nation. 
   On July 8, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was read publicly at the Continental Congress while the famous ``Liberty Bell'' was rung. Wouldn't you have liked to have been there? Congress then established a three-man Committee consisting of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Benjamin Franklin, for the purpose of designing a great seal for the United States. What were Franklin's suggestions? Franklin's suggestions for a seal and motto characterizing the spirit of this new nation were--this is Franklin talking, not ROBERT C. BYRD:  
   Moses lifting up his wand, and dividing the red sea, and pharaoh in his chariot overwhelmed with the waters. This motto: ``Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God.''  
   What did Thomas Jefferson propose? This is Thomas Jefferson talking, not ROBERT C. BYRD. Thomas Jefferson proposed:  
   The children of Israel in the wilderness, led by a cloud by day, and a pillar of fire by night.  
   Try as I may, I sense no hypersensitivity about absolute separation of religion and the government of the new country in these suggestions for symbols of our new nation. Would such men as Jefferson and Franklin have suggested such symbols if they intended for an absolute wall of separation to be erected between government and any sort of religious expression? I think not. 
   When it comes to current attitudes about the proper role of religion in America, the apple has fallen very far from the tree. In fact, our greatest leaders have shown no trepidation about God's proper place in the American panorama. I am talking about our greatest leaders. Every session of the U.S. House of Representatives and the United States Senate begins with a prayer. I heard the Chaplin pray today, and so did you. And each House, from 
   the Nation's beginning, has had its Chaplain paid with Federal tax dollars. The Supreme Court of the United States begins each session only after a solemn pronouncement that concludes with ``God save the United States and this Honorable Court.'' 
   So it is then, with almost total incredulity, that I read the continued pronouncements on the subject of prayer in school by our Supreme Court, which since 1962, has steadily chipped away at any connection between religion and the governmental sphere. How could such rulings be handed down time after time by learned men and women who are obviously familiar with the history of this nation, and with the faith-based grounding of our entire governmental structure? And recently we have this latest decision by the Supreme Court, involving voluntary student-led prayer at a Texas high school football game. 
   I don't attend football games. I have attended one in the 48 years that I have been in Washington, and I attended that only at halftime to crown the Queen; West Virginia and Maryland were playing. But even if I don't attend football games, there are people who do attend. And if it is their wish to have prayers, if the students in the band or on the football teams want to have prayer, more power to them. 
   On June 19, the highest court in our land ruled in a 6-3 decision that somehow this voluntary student-led prayer violated the Constitution's establishment clause. 
   Justice Stevens, writing for the majority opinion, said that even when attendance was voluntary and the decision to pray was made by students:  
   the delivery of a pregame prayer has the improper effect of coercing those present to participate in an act of religious worship.  
   What nonsense--nonsense. Such a pronouncement ignores a separate First Amendment problem, in that it amounts to the censorship of religious speech in a governmental forum. What about the rights of those students who wish to pray, perhaps for the safety of their classmates? Such a ruling tramples on the Constitutional rights of those students in favor of some mythical possibility that coercement might be felt by someone. 
   In a dissenting opinion, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist summed up the matter pretty nicely, I think, when he stated that the majority opinion ``bristles''--bristles--``with hostility to all things religious in public life.'' 
   Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist said it right: The majority opinion ``bristles with hostility to all things religious in public life.'' 
   For that statement, the Chief Justice will always have my gratitude. He is eminently correct, and, of course, it took courage to say what he did. As everyone knows, I am no fan of amending the U.S. Constitution, and I believe it should be done only rarely and with great care. Certainly this year, an election year, is no year to try to pass a constitutional amendment on school prayer. 
   But I intend to implore the two major party candidates--and I do implore the two major party candidates--to seriously consider including a constitutional amendment in the nature of clarifying the intent of the framers in the area of prayer in school as part of both party platforms. 
   I have yet to read a party platform. Never read one. I have never read a Democratic Party platform or any other party platform, but there are many who do, and it is only natural the parties should have platforms. People expect them to have a platform to indicate where they stand on the great issues of the day. So I urge Mr. Bush and Mr. GORE to work to put the words in the party platforms urging that there be an amendment to clarify the intent of the framers in the area of prayer in school. 
   The intent of the framers was clearly only to keep the new government from endorsing or favoring one religion over another, but not from favoring a free exercise of religion over nonreligion. Certainly, it was never to prohibit voluntary expressions of a religious nature by our citizens. 
   Just what do we teach our children? Upon what do we base the most fundamental codes of society if we are not to base them on moral precepts and spiritual precepts? How can we lead our own people, how can we grapple with issues of right and wrong, or how can we continue to inspire downtrodden peoples from around the globe if we continue to deny and to sever our basic ties to faith-based principles? 
   Alarmingly, we are crafting a political secularism which does not reflect the views or practices of most Americans, the overwhelming majority of Americans. Consider these facts:  
   Nine Americans in 10 say they have never doubted the existence of God. Eight Americans in 10 say they believe they will be called  before God on Judgment Day to answer for their actions, their words, their deeds. Eight Americans in 10 say they believe God still works miracles, and he does.  
   One sits right over there in the chair. Here sits some up here. These are miracles. There are literally millions of things that could have happened to each of us, and we would never have been born or in being born we would have been confronted with many health problems. There are miracles every day. 
   Seven Americans in 10 believe in life after death. I do, and I daresay most, if not all, of the people in this Chamber do believe there is a life after death. What would there be to live for otherwise? Oh, you may laugh now, but wait until you are 82, as I am, and well on your way to 83. To what do you have to look forward to each day of your life which is fast ebbing? Yes, you will change your mind then. 
   How can the beliefs of such sizable sections of the American population totally escape the attention of politicians and educators? They are all going to die, too. Every one of them, and they are going to have to go out and meet God in eternity, which is a long, long, long time. 
   How could these statistics escape the nine members of the Supreme Court of the United States? Does the answer lie in the elitism that so permeates this arrogant capital city? Does theology tend to thin out as one gravitates toward the top of the socioeconomic scale, rather like the thinner air at the top of some elevated peak? Are we, indeed, witnessing the writing of a new ``Tale of Two Cities'' as we watch public policy diverge ever more dramatically from the views of the people and the plain-as-day record of our own documented history? 
   Power unchecked by moral insight, teaching untempered by spiritual values, government unenlightened by faith in a Creator--no city and no nation can sustain such a course. While we may distract ourselves for a time with the affluence that a booming economy provides, eventually there is a kind of nihilism in a society whose God is materialism--whose only God is materialism. 
   Look carefully around you at the culture of America today. Just stop and think for a moment. You do not even have to look around you. Stop and think for a moment about the culture of this country today. Note the banality of most public discourse, the lack of respect for authority, the absence of common civility, the crudeness of popular entertainment, the glorification of violence. 
   There is no map, there is no compass, there is no vision, and ``Where there is no vision, the people perish.'' 
   Mr. President, the very first sentence of the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States--here is the Constitution; so small that it fits into a shirt pocket--the very first sentence of the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States reads as follows: ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; . . .'' It seems to me that the U.S. Supreme Court, over the years, in its rulings on school prayer over the last 40 years has bent over backwards to enforce the first clause in that amendment dealing with an establishment of religion, but the Court has seemingly exhibited a strong bias against the equally important--the equally important--second part of the sentence. That sentence has two parts. And the second part is, I quote: ``. . . or prohibiting the free exercise there-– of; .....'' 
   In ruling after ruling, over the past 40 years the Court seems to be going farther and farther in the direction of prohibiting the free exercise of religion. In precedent after precedent, the Court, often by slim majorities, has seemed bent upon totally eradicating any semblance whatsoever of religious speech in our public schools, even when such speech is not in any way, shape, or form connected with an ``establishment'' of religion. 
   When I read the first amendment clause dealing with freedom of religion, the words of the amendment seem to strike a balance between an establishment of religion, on the one hand, and the free exercise of religion, on the other. But the Court seems determined to completely ignore, and thus obliterate, any right to a free exercise of religion in the public schools. No wonder many people take their children out of the public schools. I believe that the framers of the United States Constitution--yea, the founders of this Republic itself--would be appalled. Can you imagine what the founders--the framers, the people who framed the Constitution, the people who voted on the ratification of the Constitution--how they would feel? I believe they would be appalled at the Court's apparent drift over the last 40 years toward total secularism and away from any modicum of voluntary religious expression in the public schools of this country. 
   Now let us briefly reflect upon the impact of religion on the development of American constitutionalism. Let's go back. Let's go back over the decades, yea, even over the centuries, and reflect upon the impact of religion on the development of American constitutionalism. We will find that the roots of religion run deep. As one scholar, Donald S. Lutz, has noted--this is what he says--``The political covenants written by English colonists in America lead us to the church covenants written by Protestants in the late 1500's and early 1600's and these, in turn, lead us back to the Covenant tradition of the Old Testament.'' That is what he said. The American constitutional tradition derives in much of its form and content from the Judeo-Christian tradition--we can't avoid it; it is there; nothing can erase it; you can take all the history books out of the schools that you want, but the fact remains that it is still there--the Judeo-Christian tradition as interpreted by the radical Protestant sects to which belonged so many of the original European settlers in British North America. 
   Lutz, in his work, entitled, ``The Origins of American Constitutionalism,'' says this: ``The tribes of Israel shared a covenant that made them a nation. American federalism originated at least in part in the dissenting Protestants' familiarity with the Bible''. 
   The early Calvinist settlers who came to this country from the Old World brought with them a familiarity with the Old Testament Covenants that made them especially apt in the formation of colonial documents and State constitutions. 
   Now, let me refer to Winton U. Solberg. He tells us that in 17th century colonial thought, divine law--a fusion of the law of nature in the Old and New Testaments--usually stood as fundamental law. The Mayflower Compact--how many of us like to claim that our forebearers were on the Mayflower? ``Oh, they were there. They were on the Mayflower.'' Well, there was such a thing written as the Mayflower Compact. 
   The Mayflower Compact exemplifies the doctrine of covenant or contract. Puritanism exalted the biblical component and drew on certain scriptural passages for a theological outlook. Called the Covenant or Federal Theology, this was a theory of contract regarding man's relations with God and the nature of church and state. 
   If we examine the public political literature written between 1760 and 1805, the book most frequently cited in that literature is the Bible. 
   Let me say that again. If we examine the public political literature written between 1760 and 1805, the book most frequently cited in that literature is the Bible. 
   Saint Paul, the great apostle, is cited about as frequently as Montesquieu and Blackstone, the two most cited secular authors. Deuteronomy is cited almost twice as often as all of Locke's writings put together. 
   Many of the references to the Bible came from reprinted sermons, while other citations came from secular works. Saint Paul was the favorite in the New Testament, especially his Epistle to the Romans, in which he discusses the basis for, and limits on, obedience to political authorities. From the Old Testament, Deuteronomy was the most cited book, followed by Isaiah, Genesis, Exodus, and Leviticus. The authors most frequently referred to the sections about covenants and God's promises to Israel. 
   The movement towards independence found the clergy out in front--the movement toward independence in this country found the clergy out in front, not back in the closet; out in front--and the clergy were also most vigorous in maintaining morale during the Revolutionary War. When reading comprehensively in the political literature  of the war years, one cannot but be struck by the extent to which biblical sources used by ministers and traditional Whigs undergirded the justification for the break with Great Britain, the rationale for continuing the war, and the basic principles of Americans writing their own Constitutions at the State level. 
   Let us look at the Mayflower Compact, of November 11, 1620. Here is what they wrote:  
   In the name of God, Amen. We, whose names are underwritten, the loyal subjects of our dread sovereign Lord, King James, by the grace of God, . . . having undertaken, for the glory of God, and advancement of the Christian faith, . . . by these presents solemnly and mutually in the presence of God, and of one another, covenant and combine ourselves together into a civil body politick, for our better ordering and preservation and furtherance of the ends aforesaid; and by virtue hereof to enact, constitute, and frame such just and equal laws, ordinances, acts, Constitutions, and offices, from time to time, as shall be thought most . . . convenient for the general good of the colony unto which we promise all due submission and obedience. . . .  
   That was the Mayflower Compact. The authors of the Mayflower Compact had no hesitation about mentioning God, no hesitation about placing their lives in his hands and saying so. Now let us examine briefly ``The Fundamental Orders of Connecticut.'' Here we will find many references to the Deity, in these orders which were adopted by a popular Convention of the three towns of Windsor, Hartford, and Wethersfield, on January 14, 1639, 361 years ago. The form, according to historians, was ``the first written Constitution, in the modern sense of the term, as a permanent limitation on governmental power, known in history, and certainly the first American Constitution of government to embody the Democratic idea.'' 
   I shall quote the following references to the Deity from The Fundamental Orders of Connecticut: Forasmuch as it hath pleased the Almighty God by the wise disposition of his divine providence . . .''; ``and well knowing where a people are gathered together the word of God requires that to maintain the peace and union of such a people, there should be an orderly and decent government established according to God, . . .''; ``. . . to maintain and preserve the liberty and purity of the Gospel of our Lord Jesus which we now profess, . . .''; ``. . . do swear by the great and dreadful name of the everlasting God, . . .'';– ``. . . so help me God, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ . . .''; ``. . . according to the righteous rule of God's word; so help me God, and so forth.'' 
   Now let us look at the opening words of the treaty with Great Britain in 1783, 217 years ago, providing for the complete independence of the American states and acknowledgment by Great Britain: ``In the name of the Most Holy and Undivided Trinity. It having pleased the Divine Providence to dispose the hearts of the most serene and most potent Prince George III, by the grace of God. . . .'' 
   The foregoing extracts, and others, from American historical documents are sufficient to impress us with the fact that religious conviction permeated the blood stream of American Constitutionalism and American statecraft as far back as 200 years prior to the writing of the Constitution in 1787. 
   Now let us examine the first inaugural address of George Washington, 1789, who had been chairman of the convention which framed the Constitution. Here is the greatest President we have ever had. A few extracts therefrom will leave no doubt as to where the Nation's first President stood when it came to religious expression in matters pertaining to Government: ``. . . it would be peculiarly improper to omit, in this first official act, my fervent supplications to that Almighty Being who rules over the Universe, who presides in the councils of nations, and whose providential aids can supply every human defect, that His benediction may consecrate to the liberties and happiness of the people of the United States a government instituted by themselves for these essential purposes, and may enable every instrument employed in its administration to execute with success the functions allotted to His charge. In tendering this homage to the great Author of every public and private good, I assure myself that it expresses your sentiments not less than my own; nor those of my fellow citizens at large less than either. No people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the Invisible Hand which conducts the affairs of men more than the people of the United States. Every step by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation, seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency.'' 
   That is George Washington, the father of our country, the commander in chief at Valley Forge, the presiding officer of the Constitutional Convention, first President of the United States and the best by any measure, by any standard. He had no hesitancy in speaking of that invisible hand that guides the Nation. If he were alive today and a Member of this Senate or a Member of the Supreme Court or President of the United States again. How clear, how incisive, and how powerful were these allusions to God by our first and greatest President! 
   Further expressions by George Washington in that same inaugural address were indicative of an unabashed religious faith:  
   Since we ought to be no less persuaded that the propitious smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right, which heaven itself has ordained; . . .; I shall take my present leave, but not without resorting once more to the benign Parent of the human race, in humble supplication, that, since He has been pleased to favor the American people with opportunities for deliberating in perfect tranquility . . . .; . . . so His divine blessing may be equally conspicuous in the enlarged views, the temperament consultations and the wise measures, on which the success of this government must depend.  
   There you have it. 
   Having quoted from Washington's first inaugural address, now let me quote briefly from Lincoln's first inaugural address--no hesitation here about calling upon--no hesitancy here about calling upon the Creator: ``If the Almighty Ruler of Nations--he is not talking about King George III--with His eternal truth and justice, be on your side of the North, or on yours of the South, that truth and that justice will surely prevail by the judgment of this great tribunal of the American people . . . .; Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity, and a firm reliance on Him who has never yet forsaken this favored land are still competent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulty.'' 
   Issuing the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, Lincoln closed his remarks with these words: ``And upon this act, sincerely believed to be an act of justice, warranted by the Constitution, upon military necessity, I invoke the considerate judgment of mankind and the gracious favor of Almighty God.'' That is Abraham Lincoln. 
   Lincoln, in his second inaugural address, rises to a rare pitch of eloquence, marked by a singular combination of tenderness and determination:  
   If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He gives to both North and South this terrible war, as the woe due to those by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope--fervently do we pray--that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's 250 years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with a sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said: ``The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.''  
   Now hear that, Supreme Court of the United States. Hear those words by Abraham Lincoln. 
   Lincoln then went on to say those words with which we all are so familiar: ``With malice towards none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.'' 
   How can one read and reflect upon these clear and unrestrained references to Almighty God expressed by our nation's two greatest Presidents--Washington and Lincoln--and hold any doubt whatsoever as to the impact of religion upon the thoughts, the character, and the lives of the two greatest statesmen America has ever produced?  
   And yet, the Supreme Court in recent years, in majority opinions, has not scrupled to bow to materialism in the Court's rulings concerning voluntary prayer in public school settings! 
   A further examination of the inaugural addresses of the Presidents finds John Adams, the second President, closing his inaugural address with the following invocation:  
   And may that Being who is supreme over all, the Patron of Order, the Fountain of Justice, and the Protector in all ages of the world of virtuous liberty, continue His blessing upon this nation and its government and give it all possible success and duration consistent with the ends of His providence.  
   Thomas Jefferson's closing words in his second inaugural address were these:  
   I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we are, who led our fathers, as Israel of old, from their native land and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessaries and comforts of life; who has covered our infancy with His providence and our riper years with His wisdom and power, and to whose goodness I ask you to join in supplications with me that He will so enlighten the minds of your servants, guide their councils, and prosper their measures that whatsoever they do shall result in your good, and shall secure to you the peace, friendship, and approbation of all nations.  
   James Madison, the chief author of our Constitution, showed no hesitancy in expressing his dependence upon Providence:  
   My confidence will under every difficulty be best placed, next to that which we have all been encouraged to feel in the guardianship and guidance of that Almighty Being whose power regulates the destiny of nations, whose blessings have been so conspicuously dispensed to this rising Republic, and to whom we are bound to address our devout gratitude for the past, as well as our fervent supplications and best hopes for the future.  
   Having quoted from the inaugural addresses of our country's first four Presidents, I shall now recall to my fellow Senators references to God in the inaugural addresses of four Presidents in the current 20th century. I begin with William Howard Taft who, subsequent to having served as President, fulfilled a lifelong dream in 1921 when he was sworn in as Chief Justice of the United States. He ended his inaugural address with these words:  
   I invoke the considerate sympathy and support of my fellow citizens and the aid of the Almighty God in the discharge of my responsible duties.  
   Franklin D. Roosevelt refers to the Supreme Being in each of his inaugural addresses, but I shall quote only from the fourth and last:  
   The Almighty God has blessed our land in many ways. He has given our people stout hearts and strong arms with which to strike mighty blows for freedom and truth. He has given to our country a faith which has become the hope of all peoples in an anguished world. 
   So we pray to Him now for the vision to see our way clearly--to see the way that leads to a better life for ourselves and for all our fellow men--to the achievement of His will, to peace on earth.  
   Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had been Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in Europe during World War II, and had served as Supreme Commander of NATO, took the oath of office as President using both George Washington's Bible and one given to him by his mother at his graduation from the Military Academy at West Point. 
   Many of us remember his prayer at the beginning of his first inaugural address:  
   Almighty God, as we stand here at this moment my future associates in the executive branch of government join me in beseeching that Thou will make full and complete our dedication to the service of the people in this throng, and their fellow citizens everywhere. 
   Give us, we pray, the power to discern clearly right from wrong, and allow all our words and actions to be governed thereby, and by the laws of this land. Especially we pray that our concern shall be for all the people regardless of station, race, or calling. 
   May cooperation be permitted and be the mutual aim of those who, under the concepts of our Constitution, hold to differing political faiths; so that all may work for the good of our beloved country and Thy glory. Amen. 
   Dwight D. Eisenhower led the Nation in prayer himself. 
   Eisenhower's was the first prayer to be uttered by a President in his inaugural address to the nation, but it was not to be the last. President Reagan, in his second inaugural address, began his inaugural address with a silent prayer:  
   I wonder if we could all join in a moment of silent prayer. [Moment of silent prayer.] Amen.  
   George Bush, after taking the oath with his hand placed on George Washington's Bible, began his presidency with a prayer:  
   And my first act as President is a prayer. I ask you to bow your heads: 
   Heavenly father, we bow our heads and thank You for Your love. Accept our thanks for the peace that yields this day and the shared faith that makes its continuance likely. Make us strong to do Your work, willing to heed and hear Your will, and write on our hearts these words: `Use power to help people.' For we are given power not to advance our own purposes, nor to make a great show in the world, nor a name. There is but one just use of power, and it is to serve people. Help us to remember it, Lord. Amen.  
   That was George Bush. 
   I have a reason for quoting from these great American documents and for these inaugural and other addresses by some of our Presidents. There have been other Presidents whom I could have quoted. 
   All of these references to religious faith that I have quoted from early American documents and from inaugural addresses by Presidents bear witness to the fact that a strong spiritual consciousness has pervaded the fabric of American statecraft and American Constitutionalism for two centuries prior to the writing of the U.S. Constitution and for these two centuries following that event. 
   Mr. President, the Framers of the Constitution, the voters who ratified that Constitution, the members of the First Congress who supported the first amendment to the Constitution, and the people in the states who ratified the First Amendment, would be aghast at the interpretations of the First Amendment clause by U.S. Supreme Court rulings concerning prayer in the public schools of America. I say that those rulings are having the effect of ``prohibiting the free exercise'' of religion. The court has drifted too far from the shore. 
   I lauded the six members of the Supreme Court whose votes declared the Line Item Veto Act of 1995 to be unconstitutional. But the Court's majority has adopted a dangerous trend in case after case concerning the free exercise of religion in the public schools. The situation has become so bad that most school boards frown upon the use of God's name by teachers or students for fear of being hit with a costly law suit. I have had that happen right in West Virginia, and just within the last year. Consequently, God is being driven out of the public schools completely. I shudder to think that what we put into the schools will, in a generation, dominate the nation, and what we drop from the schools will, in a generation, leave the nation. Can it be said, therefore, that the U.S. Supreme Court is heading us down the road to becoming a godless nation? 
   The opponents of voluntary prayer in schools are quick to say that the place for prayer is in the home--and it is--and not in the schoolroom. This argument portrays an amazing ignorance of the religious awareness that has been the underpinning of our Republic from its earliest beginnings. Prayer in the public schools was prevalent in our country until the courts began to whittle away at this tradition in recent years. So, we are told that there is no place for God in the schoolroom. 
   It must be confusing to the child who is taught by parents at bedtime to repeat the words: ``Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep; if I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take'', but if the same child mentions the Lord's name in school, the teacher feels it necessary to say ``shuh, we must not mention the Lord's name in school.'' 
   At home and at the breakfast table, America's children are taught to say: ``God is great, 
   God is good, and we thank Him for this food; by His goodness all are fed, give us Lord our daily bread,'' but in the schoolroom at lunchtime, the children must not say grace over the food. That might offend someone. Hence, the home and the school are at war with each other today. 
   I wonder if the high court is aware of the chaos that it is creating in the schools of the country? School administrators are caught in a bind. I wonder if the court is aware of the harm that it is doing to the nation when it strongly enforces the first half of the religious clause while it shows a dangerous bias against the second half of the same clause? Isn't it about time that the Supreme Court demonstrates an equal balance in its interpretation of the first sentence of the First  Amendment to the Constitution? It seems to me that the court is drifting farther and farther to the left of center in its drift towards materialism and radical secularism as its opinions serve more and more to inhibit any display of religious belief by the nation's school children. In an effort to ensure a tolerance for all beliefs, the courts are bending too far, in effect, establishing an environment of intolerance rather than tolerance. 
   Mr. President, we rail, and moan, and gnash our teeth, and wring our hands as we see more and more violence in our schools and a general decline in morals throughout the nation. Is it any wonder? Our nation's leaders are no longer paragons of rectitude. Don't point to them as being the idols of our youth. The institution of marriage is crumbling; the church, more and more, refrains from speaking out boldly on the great moral issues of the day; and God is being driven from the classrooms of our nation's schools by the U.S. Supreme Court's decisions that favor secularism, materialism, and the stifling of any voluntary and free exercise of religion in the public schools. Is it any wonder that more and more parents are determined to send their children to private schools and to religious schools? 
   Mr. President, George Washington, the Father of our country, our first President, bequeathed to us a clear vision of the importance of religion to morality in our national life, when he said, in his farewell address to the nation in September, 1796: ``Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it simply be asked, George Washington said, where is the security for property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths, which are the instruments of investigations in courts of justice? And let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. It can't be done. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.'' I hope the Supreme Court will review those words by our first president, the man who presided over the Constitutional Convention in 1787. 
   Mr. President, it is not an idle reflection if, while discussing the issue of prayer in the public schools, we contemplate the profundity of Benjamin Franklin's words to the Constitutional Convention on June 28, 1787, when he made a sobering suggestion that brought the assembly of doubting minds ``to a realization that destiny herself sat as guest and witness in this room.'' The weather had been hot, and the delegates to the Convention were tired and edgy. The debates were seemingly getting nowhere and a melancholy cloud seemed to hover over the Convention. Little progress was being made, and the prevailing winds were those of discouragement, dissension, and despair, when old Dr. Franklin, sitting with the famous double spectacles low on his nose, broke silence; he had said little during these past days. Addressing himself to George Washington in the chair, Franklin, according to Catherine Drinker Bowen, in her book, ``Miracle at Philadelphia,'' reminded the Convention how, at the beginning of the war with England, the Continental Congress had had prayers for Divine protection, and in this very room. ``Our prayers, Sir, were heard,'' said Franklin, ``and they were graciously answered. All of us who were engaged in the struggle must have observed frequent instances of a Superintending providence in our favor. To that kind Providence we owe this happy opportunity of consulting in peace on the means of establishing our future national felicity. And have we now forgotten that powerful friend? I have lived, Sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth--that God governs in the affairs of men.'' 
   Bowen, in her magnificent story of the Constitutional Convention, goes on to say that on Dr. Franklin's manuscript of his little speech, ``the word God is twice underscored, perhaps as indication to the printer. But whether or no Franklin looked upon the Deity as worthy of three capital letters, his speech was timely.'' You will read this same speech in Madison's notes. 
   ``If a sparrow cannot fall to the ground unseen by Him,'' Franklin continued, ``was it probable that an empire could arise without his aid? `I firmly believe this, and I also believe that without his concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better than the builders of Babel.''' Franklin proposed that ``henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of heaven and its blessings on our deliberations, be held in this Assembly every morning before we proceed to business, and that one or more of the clergy of this city be requested to officiate in that service.'' 
   Roger Sherman at once seconded Franklin's motion. Incidentally, on yesterday, July 16, 1787, the convention adopted the great compromise, without which none of us would be here today. That compromise established two bodies in the legislative branch and provided that each State would be equal in this branch, that we would have votes in this branch. I won't go further, but you might recall it was only yesterday. 
   But Hamilton and several others, wrote Madison, feared that calling in a clergymen at so late a stage might lead the public to suspect dissensions in the Convention. Williamson of North Carolina made the frank statement that everyone knew the real reason for not engaging a chaplain: the Convention had no funds. Franklin's motion failed, though Randolph proposed that on the approaching Fourth of July, a sermon be preached at the request of the Convention and that thenceforth prayers be used. In any event, we can all learn a lesson from this episode: God was very much a part of national life at a time when the greatest document of its kind--the Constitution of the United States--was ever written, a time when it was being formed. 
   Mr. President, I close with words from the Bible, which Franklin aptly used in his speech: ``Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it; except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.'' 
   It would be well, Mr. President, if this Biblical admonition were kept in mind as future cases concerning school prayer come before the courts of the land. 
   As a matter of fact, this admonition is one on which all three branches of government should reflect. We here in the legislative branch bear some responsibility. Here is where laws are made, and here is where some positive steps could originate on a path toward correcting a court imposed imbalance. The executive branch, too, could play some useful role in that regard. This being an election year, I urge that the Democratic and Republican political Conventions adopt planks--why not--in their respective platforms advocating a Constitutional amendment concerning prayer in schools. Both the Democratic and Republican nominees for President should be urged to support such an amendment. 
   Both nominees should be urged to speak out on this subject during the campaigns. I intend to urge that both nominees do that. 
   I thank all Senators and I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the Fiscal Year 2001 Interior and Related Agencies appropriations bills, I wish to take a moment to address the Department of Energy's Clean Coal Technology Demonstration program, one of the most successful public-private research ventures ever undertaken, and one of the more important projects funded in this legislation. 
   Fundamentally, the goal of the Clean Coal program is simple: Encourage the private sector to design and demonstrate advanced technologies which will use coal, our most abundant fossil energy resource, more cleanly and efficiently. To achieve that goal, I initiated the Clean Coal Technology Demonstration program in 1984 with an initial appropriation of $750 million. In subsequent years, I was able to add to those funds for a total amount in excess of $2.0 billion. I am pleased to recall that then-President Ronald Reagan joined with me in endorsing the Clean Coal Technology Demonstration program. 
   As established, the program calls for the cost of clean coal demonstration projects to be shared equally between the Federal government and the private sector. Forty clean coal projects have been selected through a series of competitive solicitations issued by the Department of Energy. And while Congress required industry to contribute 50 percent of the cost of selected projects, I am proud to say that, in toto, industry has in fact contributed more than 66 percent of the total cost. Moreover, project sponsors are required to repay the Federal government's share of the project cost if and when the technologies are commercialized. 
   Beyond the successes that have come from the Clean Coal program, though, a few simple facts will also underscore the real necessity of the program as well. Our nation has approximately 274 billion tons of recoverable coal reserves. At current rates of consumption those reserves amount to more than a 200-year supply. Furthermore, more than one half--54 percent to be exact--of the electricity generated in this country last year came from coal. Mr. President, those are staggering statistics which prove that American coal is, and will remain, an abundant and critically important energy source. But those statistics also suggest that our reliance on coal must be carried out in a manner which utilizes the cleanest and most efficient technologies possible. And that is what the Clean Coal program is intended to accomplish. 
   In furtherance of that objective, the Committee on Appropriations, through its report accompanying this bill, has directed the Department of Energy to issue a report to Congress by March 1, 2001, depicting the nature and content of a potential new round of Clean Coal Technology projects. This information is vital if we in the Congress are to direct the Department to utilize funds already available in the Clean Coal program for the purpose of funding additional demonstration projects. 
   Indeed, Mr. President, I have heard from a number of companies interested in coal and the development of technologies that will allow this nation to make the best use of this abundant energy resource. These companies, some of which are in my own state of West Virginia, have recommended that any new clean coal solicitation be focused principally upon technologies that will reduce the environmental impacts from existing, as well as new, coal-fired facilities. In addition, I believe that we ought to be encouraging newer technologies that are even more advanced than the clean coal technologies that  have been demonstrated thus far. A new solicitation should therefore encourage technologies capable of reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO  
   2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), or mercury, as well as increasing the operating efficiency of coal-fired power plants thereby reducing--and through technologies, working to eliminate--carbon dioxide emissions.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today the Senate will consider legislation to address the anomaly in the tax code known as the marriage penalty. The Senate will consider this legislation in light of recent budget projections that show a windfall in federal budget surpluses over the next ten years, and under expedited rules that will almost guarantee passage of some form of marriage penalty relief. 
   First, I am, as are many other Senators, concerned about the so-called marriage penalty. I can think of no reason why a married couple should have a higher tax liability simply because they have chosen to make a lifelong commitment together through the sacred bond of marriage. I doubt that any Senator would refute the assertion that the promotion of marriage and family stability benefits the nation at large. Indeed, the marriage bond as recognized in the Judaeo-Christian tradition, as well as in the legal codes of the world's most advanced societies, is a cornerstone on which societies build their morals and values. The Bible tells us in 1 Corinthians 7 to ``..... let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband. Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband. The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife. Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.'' The institution of marriage was prized in the Bible, and likewise, by the ancient world in Rome, and more particularly, in Greece. ``There is nothing nobler or more admirable than when two people who see  eye to eye keep house as man and wife, confounding their enemies and delighting their friends,'' wrote Homer in The Odyssey (9th Century BC). 
   Our federal government has no official policy on marriage with respect to taxing or subsidizing the institution. Still, what can only be referred to as a quirk in the tax code causes some married couples to pay higher taxes than they would if they were single. I have always believed that the federal income tax code should, at the very least, be marriage neutral. Unfortunately, marriage neutrality has proven to be an elusive goal. The reason is that marriage neutrality is incompatible with a progressive tax system that allows for joint tax returns. When two single taxpayers are married, their incomes increase and can, in some cases, push the couple into a higher tax bracket than when they filed as separate singles. The opposite can also happen, where married couples find themselves in a lower tax bracket than when they were single. 
   Both the Republican and Democratic proposals before the Senate today attempt to balance the competing interests of progressive taxation, joint tax returns, and marriage neutrality in the best way possible. The Republican proposal, for example, reduces the marginal tax rates for married couples so that recently married couples would not be bumped up into a higher tax bracket. This would effectively eliminate the marriage penalty relating to marginal tax rates. The trade-off is that marriage bonuses, which occur when a married couple pay less in taxes than they would if they filed as two single taxpayers, would be increased. 
   While some Senators would argue that the Republican proposal is a tax giveaway to households that already receive favorable tax treatment because of marriage, marriage bonuses provide increased assistance for families who make the difficult choice to forgo a second income or career and for one parent to stay at home with their children. Families in this situation ought to be extended tax incentives just the same as those families with a limited income and a child in the child care system. Raising children to be responsible, caring, law-abiding adults is one of the most important tasks that any of us will ever undertake. As we can see daily from the steady stream of frightening newspaper headlines on schoolyard shootings and gang activities, it is also one of the hardest. The fabric of our society, the warp of family closeness and the woof of community, is torn and frayed. If a family makes the increasingly difficult choice to allow one parent to stay at home and focus on child rearing, then, frankly, I think we ought to make it easier for them 
   to do so. We certainly should not make it harder, or more financially punitive! It is too important for the continued strength of our society. I am pleased that this bill takes this important step of recognizing the role of the stay-at-home parent by providing these families with a small amount of relief to assist with the costs of raising a child. 
   The Democratic proposal also attempts to balance the goals of joint tax entities and progressive taxation with marriage neutrality. This proposal would allow married couples to calculate their income tax as either a married couple or as two singles, depending on which method would be less costly. The effect of this approach would be the elimination for eligible couples of all sixty-five marriage penalty provisions in the tax code, while maintaining the existing marriage bonuses. 
   Both proposals provide marriage penalty relief to families of all income levels. In the Republican proposal, lower-income families who receive the earned income tax credit would benefit from marriage penalty relief, while the elimination of the marriage penalty caused by the standard deduction would benefit middle-income households. The Democratic proposal, however, is more targeted to lower- and middle-income households because the marriage penalty relief is phased out for couples with an income above $150,000 per year. 
   But, make no mistake, both proposals, even in the glow of recent surplus projections, would be extremely expensive. The Republican proposal would cost $248 billion over ten years, and $39 billion per year thereafter. The Democratic proposal is slightly less expensive because of the income cap, but would still cost $54.2 billion over five years. My concern is not so much the cost of these proposals, because I think that the cost would be justified by the marriage incentives provided in each, but that marriage penalty relief could open the floodgates to other, more massive tax cuts. Most Senators are aware that the Office of Management and Budget announced during the week of June 26 that projected budget surpluses would exceed estimates made just four months ago by $1.3 trillion, and the Congressional Budget Office is close to releasing its projections that are likely to predict similar results. These new projections raise the estimate of surpluses that will be collected by the government over the next ten years (excluding Social Security) to $1.9 trillion, and, consequently, have fanned the furor for massive tax cuts. 
   These surplus projections can have an intoxicating effect, so much so that massive tax cuts seem suddenly affordable. What is forgotten is the fact that these surplus projections are highly volatile, and subject to dramatic change. Just since last year, these ten-year surplus projections have increased by almost $2 trillion. Some of that increase stemmed from an increase in tax revenues from the strong economy, but most resulted from simple changes in expectations about how well the economy would perform five and ten years out into the future. These expectations could easily change in the next few years so that, just as quickly as these surpluses appeared, they could disappear. 
   I think that it is unfortunate that higher-than-expected surpluses have paved the way for the enactment of massive tax cuts. The repeal of the estate tax, for example, which was recently passed by this body, if enacted into law, would cost $105 billion over ten years, and then $50 billion per year thereafter. No hearings were held on this proposal in the Senate. Little consideration was given to an alternative plan that would have been less costly and would have more expeditiously addressed the plight of farmers and small businesses by eliminating most from estate tax rolls. Little, if any, consideration was given to the negative effect that repealing the estate tax would have on charitable contributions, which are deductible from the gross value of an estate under current law. Yet, this body repealed the estate tax under the guise that it was necessary to protect small family farmers and businesses, when much less costly proposals might have done the job just as well. 
   Let us disabuse ourselves of the idea that all tax cuts are good policy because they are politically popular. They are not. It is easy to vote for tax cuts. It does not require courage. And, in the end, the American people will not thank us for acting in a fiscally irresponsible manner. As I have said on many occasions, while budget projections look rosy now, the future is fraught with peril as the baby-boomers exit the economy, and the Social Security and Medicare programs become unable, as presently structured, to pay full benefits to recipients. The Social Security and Medicare Board of Trustees projected last March that Social Security payroll taxes by themselves would not be enough to cover benefit payments by 2015, and that the Social Security trust fund would be insolvent by 2037. Likewise, the trustees projected that the Medicare Hospital Insurance trust fund would be insolvent by 2025. 
   While I support eliminating any marriage penalties that may exist in the tax code, my preference would be to delay enactment of these costly proposals until the long term solvency of Social Security and Medicare have been addressed. However, in order to meet the political deadline of the upcoming Party conventions, the Senate is acting on this legislation today, which is unfortunate. 
   I support marriage penalty relief, and I believe that both the Republican and Democratic proposals would provide substantial relief. However, I object to the fashion in which these proposals are being considered. As I said before, these proposals are extremely expensive. They should be debated in a way that would allow for many amendments and ample debate time. Unfortunately, they were brought up under  reconciliation protections to avoid such restrictions. While the intent of the legislation may be worthwhile, I object 
   to legislation being pushed through in this manner. The fast-track reconciliation procedures that were enacted in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 were never intended to be used as a method to enact massive tax cuts that could not be passed without a thorough debate and amendment process. I know, because I helped to write the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and it was never my contemplation that the reconciliation process would be used in this way and for these purposes--never! I would not have supported it. I would have voted against it. 
   In fact, I would have left some loopholes in the process that would have saved us from this spectacle every year, where tax legislation with wide-ranging ramifications on domestic and defense spending priorities that should be debated at great length and amended many times is rushed through this Chamber in order to fulfill a political party's agenda. Reconciliation has become a bear trap that cuts off senators from debate and ensures that legislation will be voted upon regardless of whether there has been ample debate. Reconciliation typically allows for only twenty hours of debate, equally divided between the two leaders, which can be yielded back by the leaders under a nondebatable motion. This year, the reconciliation bill will be voted upon after only two hours and twenty-two minutes of debate. Less than two and one-half hours on a measure that would cost $248 billion over ten years. We owe the American people the assurance that their representatives are enacting legislation that will substantively address the marriage penalty problem in the most cost-efficient method possible. 
   I spoke in April on marriage penalty relief and the majority party's insistence on pushing this particular legislation through the Senate. While I supported marriage penalty relief then, I still opposed cloture to end debate on the underlying bill to allow senators to offer amendments, debate those amendments, and then vote on those amendments. Incidentally, this legislation was withdrawn from the floor after the minority party insisted on these rights, which is why this marriage penalty relief bill is now being considered in this fashion, under reconciliation protection. I made remarks in April on the marriage penalty relief bill, and made reference to James Madison's ideas on popular government, and the irony of how pushing through marriage penalty relief based on the notion that it is politically popular represented Madison's most profound worries about the character of republican politics. A fear of impulsive and dangerous influence that runaway public opinion could exert over legislation lay at the core of his thinking in 1787 and 1788. Indeed, Madison searched for the proper mechanics for the safe expression of public opinion to prevent popular majorities from pursuing their purposes through means that wore away the bonds that might otherwise restrain them. I think it is also fair to say that Madison would have opposed legislating in this fashion, and the enactment of tax legislation under reconciliation instructions because it removes the bonds that ordinarily would prevent the majority party from pushing through legislation which happens to be the hot political issue of the moment. The Senate will learn one day the detrimental cost of legislating in this fashion. 
   Nonetheless, as I have said before, I will support both marriage penalty relief proposals in order to eliminate what can only be described as an unintended and unfair consequence of the income tax code. However, I do so with a certain degree of reluctance out of concern that my support would, in any way, be considered an endorsement of this style of legislating or that it would indicate my willingness to forsake fiscal responsibility relating to Social Security and Medicare in order to finance massive tax cuts.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this is my 42nd year on the Appropriations Committee. I think I have served longer than any Member, past or present. The Appropriations Committee was first created in 1867. I don't have any doubt that I have served with the greatest chairmen who have served on that committee since its inception in 1867. That was 133 years ago. I have served with Senators such as Carl Hayden of Arizona, Dick Russell, John Stennis, John McClellan, Allen Ellender, and Senator Hatfield. These were great chairmen. They had long service in the Senate. I served with all of them. But I have never served with a better chairman on the Appropriations Committee than the current chairman, TED STEVENS. I think he is a better chairman than I was. I don't say that idly. He works at the job all the time. He works hard. I support him in this request to the leaders. 
   I don't happen to be a great fan of the treaty with China. I will have more to say about that later. But I am a great fan of getting these appropriations bills down to the President on time. When I was chairman, we were able to get all the appropriations bills passed before the beginning of the new fiscal year. 
   I join my chairman in pleading with the leadership--and the leadership has been most cooperative on both sides--to help get these bills moved and into conference and down to the President. 
   The chairman, Mr. STEVENS, hit the nail right on the head when he said we don't need to have another wrangle with the President over appropriations bills right at the end of the session. That plays into the President's hands. I think all Senators are aware of the fact that I believe the legislative branch is the predominant branch, and was meant to be the predominant branch among the three equal and coordinate branches. I think it has the upper hand, if Members of the Congress will but will stand up for the Senate and its constitutional powers. 
   I think it is important that we finish these bills because, when we wait until the end of the session, and we are left with an omnibus bill, the President wins every time. You may think you can beat the President in that deal. You can't do it. The President wins because he then has the upper hand. He has your back to the wall. Senators and House Members want to get out of here and go home. They have schedules to fill back in their districts and in their States. It plays into his hands if appropriation bills only reach him at the last minute. I don't like to play into any President's hands. 
   I think most Members are very aware that we need to work with the President. But it is highly important we get these bills passed. Let the PNTR wait. Why be in such a hurry on that treaty? Why be in such a hurry? It would be better if we were to take a little more time and examine that treaty more carefully and consider what the ramifications of its approval may be. 
   Last night we were able to get legislation adopted to create a national security commission. It will be a congressional commission. We will not have to depend upon the administration to tell us what impact that trade with China may have on our national security. We will have our own commission. It will be appointed by the joint leadership of both Houses. That commission will report to the Congress. 
   I have a somewhat jaundiced eye when it comes to moving in such a big hurry to take up the China treaty. As far as I am concerned, it ought to go over until next year. Let's take another look at it. That is just one Senator's opinion. 
   I plead with the leader--I say to this also to my own leader--to help us get these appropriations bills passed, to get them to conference, and then downtown. We can talk and wrangle and debate about the China treaty afterwards. 
   I thank my chairman.

   Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from Montana. 
   Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment offered by my colleague, Senator ABRAHAM. This amendment would repeal the entire 18.4-cent Federal excise tax on gasoline for a five-month period. In my view, this amendment represents bad transportation policy, bad energy policy, and bad tax policy. The amendment would play political games with the American driving public by eliminating the Federal gasoline tax and reinstating it five months later, after the people have gone to the polls in November. The amendment would violate the trust that we restored to the Highway Trust Fund when we enacted the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. It would, over the long run, put at risk billions of dollars of necessary investment in our Nation's highway infrastructure, while providing absolutely no guarantee that the consumer will see even one penny of this tax reduction at the gas pump. 
   This will be the third time in four months that the Senate will vote on repealing some, or all, of the Federal excise tax on gasoline. Back on April 6th, the Senate adopted my amendment expressing the Sense of the Senate that the Federal excise tax on gasoline should not be repealed on either a permanent or temporary basis. That amendment was adopted by a broad bipartisan vote of 65-35. That amendment stated explicitly that ``..... any effort to reduce the federal gasoline tax or de-link the relationship between highway user fees and highway spending poses a great danger to the integrity of the Highway Trust Fund and the ability of the states to invest adequately in our transportation infrastructure.'' Just five days later, the Senate voted against the Motion to Invoke Cloture on S. 2285, again on a bipartisan basis, by a vote of 43-56. That bill would have repealed 4.3 cents of the 18.4-cent gasoline excise tax. 
   The Senate did the right thing back in April, when it rejected these dangerous proposals to take 4.3 cents of gas tax revenue out of the Highway Trust Fund. This amendment by Senator ABRAHAM, however, is far more dangerous. Indeed, it is four times more dangerous than those proposals because this amendment would repeal the entire 18.4-cent gasoline tax for a five-month period and would deprive the Highway Trust Fund of more than $10 billion. 
   I have heard it said that this amendment would in no way endanger the level of spending for our nation's highways. Indeed, some very odd language is included in this amendment. It is basically the same language that was included in S. 2285, which the Senate rejected back in April. That language sought to mandate that spending from the Highway Trust Fund be maintained at the level authorized in TEA-21, even though the revenue is not there to support those funding levels. This is a very neat sleight of hand indeed. But, does anyone truly believe that this is a workable approach over the long term? The chairman of the Surface Transportation Subcommittee, Senator VOINOVICH, clearly does not, I don't believe. My colleague, Senator WARNER, who chaired the Surface Transportation Subcommittee during the debate on TEA-21, certainly does not. Together, Senator WARNER, Senator GRAMM, Senator BAUCUS, and I fought tirelessly for many months to restore the ``trust'' to the Highway Trust Fund. So, I implore all Members on both sides of the aisle to reject this plan that will compromise that trust. 
   Mr. President, I believe this amendment is not just reckless transportation policy, it is reckless energy policy as well. These short-term, feel-good tax cuts cannot substitute for a comprehensive energy policy that decreases our dependence on foreign oil. The American people are not naive. They will see right through any proposal to eliminate a tax temporarily until after Election Day, the effect of which they may not even see, only to be followed by reimposition of the 18.4-cent gas tax a few months hence. 
   Even the ``triple A''-- the association that represents no one but the people who pay the gas tax at the pump--opposes this amendment.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the chairman of the subcommittee and I are here on the floor. We are very eager to have Senators who want to call up amendments come to the floor and call up their amendments. I urge Senators: Make haste and come while the time is running and ripe. At some point we have to call up our amendments or go to third reading. It is a little early to go to third reading, but I would plead with Senators not to wait. This is an excellent opportunity. If I had an amendment to the bill, I would be eager to see a moment such as this when other Senators are not seeking recognition, and I would be eager to come to the floor, work out my amendment with the two managers, and be on my way back to the office and other things. 
   So I make that urgent plea because at some point, if Senators do not come to the floor with their amendments, I may move to go to third reading and get the yeas and nays on that. Of course, if that motion carries, there can be no more amendments. I am not saying I will do that yet, but there will come a time. That is a good fiddler's tune: There will come a time, there will come a time someday. This is your chance, now. Staffs of Senators who are working on amendments, this is your chance. Get your Senator here and let's get the amendments and get votes. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the China trade measure which passed the House eliminates the annual congressional renewal of most-favored-nation treatment of China, and gives China permanent normal trade relations with the United States. This legislation has not yet been scheduled for action on the Senate floor, yet there is already a concerted effort to defeat any amendments by Senators which might deviate from the provisions of the bill as passed by the House. The fear is that a different Senate version would require a conference committee, and another House vote, both of which may make it more uncertain that the legislation will be enacted this session. 
   Given this situation, which is an obvious egregious deviation from the traditional role of the Senate in foreign affairs, those of us who believe that the House bill can be improved must find a way to pass separate legislation which still addresses matters of importance in the burgeoning U.S.-Chinese trade relationship. There is one particular area, in which I believe the House bill and the amendments passed to it, are silent, and cry out for some adequate treatment, and that is in the area of national security. The administration argued in getting enough votes for its China trade bill in the House, that it is in the national security interest of the United States to pass the bill. I do not believe that for one moment. That is quite an assertion given the brutal Communist dictatorship in China, which systematically violates the agreements it has signed with us, and which routinely pressures U.S. firms to hand over key technologies as the price for doing business in China. This is the same Chinese dictatorship which talks about financial war with the United States, and which periodically intimidates Taiwan with threats of invasion. This is the same Chinese dictatorship which hunts down dissenters, hunts down free expression, and religious organizations with a club. 
   Despite this assertion, there is no mechanism to thoroughly and regularly assess the national security impacts on, and implications of, the developing trading relationship with China. The huge trade and dollar surpluses that are amassed by the Chinese Government and the tensions between the United States and China on trade and national security issues, as well as on human and labor rights, need informed and periodic review. There are those who argue that our annual debate over renewal of most-favored-nation treatment of China did not amount to much because we never failed to renew MFN. However, annual MFN review was of great importance to the Chinese Government, since it certainly provided a regular open window to expose questionable Chinese trading, human rights, military, and other policies to a wide audience. 
   Such monitoring and regular reporting to Congress from a reliable source is particularly important in an era where massive and unbalanced trade flows are certain to continue, and where, because of China's membership in the WTO, U.S. bilateral leverage and congressional authority under the commerce clause have been severely reduced. I would contend that the U.S.-Chinese relationship is likely to be of enduring concern to this body. Surely, the national security implications of that relationship, the impacts of massive trade deficits which now approach some $70 billion a year, the voracious appetite of the Chinese Government for military technologies, and the pressures it brings on our Asian allies are important to us. The implications of systematic unfair trade practices by the Chinese Government, of dumping into our markets, of not enforcing and not complying with agreements they have signed with us, and of pressuring Western companies to hand over important technologies as a price for doing business in 
   China and as a quid pro quo for being able to relocate and invest in China, should be of concern to the elected representatives of the American people. 
   The chief Chinese imports from the United States are primarily sophisticated manufactured products, like aircraft, telecommunications equipment, and semiconductors. Many of these technologies have multiple uses, both civilian and military. China's development effort is heavily dependent on Western companies as sources of capital and technology. There are some who contend that the large surpluses, as well as the capital, and many technologies are being funneled to a concerted effort to fuel a military buildup which the Chinese could not otherwise muster. There are those who contend that we are unwittingly giving the Chinese the tools to intimidate Taiwan, our democratic friend, and our other Asian allies, such as Thailand, South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines. 
   Chinese military officers have recently written about the need to practice financial war, cyber war, and other economic and technologically sophisticated means of affecting the security relationship with the United States. Given the technological prowess of the United States in prosecuting the Gulf War and the Kosovo conflict, the Chinese have been reportedly alarmed regarding the obsolescence of their military machine and their military practices. The standing armies, upon which they have traditionally relied, cannot perform effectively against the new weaponry demonstrated by the United States in those conflicts. There are those in China who believe that their long-term interests lie in competition and possibly confrontation with the United States, and thus in order to compete they must rapidly acquire a range of technologies and expertise that is only available from Western firms. Are we unwittingly supplying those factions in China with the means to confront us? Certainly our own self-interest would dictate that we need to monitor these trends systematically and periodically and that is the purpose of the Byrd-Warner amendment. 
   I think that it is only prudent that we provide for an annual systematic review and a report to the Congress on the full range of national security implications engendered by the increased  trade and investment relationship with China. The House has a commission in its China trade bill, an executive-legislative commission to monitor a staggering range of human rights and democracy-building reforms in China. It has a full plate of responsibilities. While this sort of monitoring is certainly important, no less important should be the existence of a congressional commission to focus on the national security relationship between our two nations. The President has argued that it is in our national security interest to further open and widen our trading relations with China. That proposition should be regularly tested by an independent commission, which has the narrow mandate of monitoring our growing bilateral relationship with an eye toward United States security concerns. 
   The Congress last year created a 12-person commission, equally divided between Republicans and Democrats, to examine our growing negative trade balance. The Trade Deficit Review Commission will likely finish its work in a few months, with a report to the Congress and the President, on the implications of our global deficits, recommending new practices, institutions and policies. It has already conducted hearings and studies on the Chinese relationship. Mr. WARNER and I suggest that this same commission is an appropriate tool, extended and refocused, to conduct an annual Chinese assessment and review. Such a refocused commission would serve as a good companion to the one proposed by the House bill on human rights and democratic reforms in China. Its existence and assessments would certainly help to repair the dangerous erosion of congressional involvement in, and leverage 
   over, foreign commerce envisioned as essential to our national well being by the framers. It would help to replace congressional monitoring of China resulting from her accession to the World Trade Organization, in an area critical to the deeply rooted constitutional responsibilities of this body. 
   That is the purpose of the amendment which Senator WARNER and I and other Senators have offered. In summary, the commission would review the national security implications of our trade and investment relations with China, including the following elements: 
   One, the portion of trade in goods and services dedicated by the Chinese Government to military systems; 
   Two, an analysis of the statements and writings of Chinese officials bearing on the intentions of the Chinese Government regarding military competition with and leverage over the United States and its Asian allies; 
   Three, the military actions taken by the Chinese Government over the preceding years bearing on the national security of the United States and its Asian allies; 
   Four, the acquisition by the Chinese Government of advanced military technologies and systems through U.S. trade and Chinese procurement policies; 
   Five, the use of financial transactions, capital flows, and currency manipulations to affect the national security of the United States; 
   Six, actions taken by the Chinese Government in the context of the WTO which are adverse to U.S. national security interests; 
   Seven, an overall assessment of the state of any security challenges to the U.S. by the Chinese Government and whether the trend from previous years is increasing or declining; and finally, the commission would also provide recommendations for action, including any use of the national defense waiver provision that already exists in the GATT Treaty, and applies to the WTO. This article, article 21 of the GATT, has never been used by any nation state, but remains available to be triggered if the Congress finds some aspect of our growing relationship with China on the trade account which adversely affects our national security and needs to be stopped or somehow moderated. 
   In addition to these matters, there is also growing concern over the activities of China in transferring missile technologies to other nations, affecting the security of the United States and, also, our Asian allies. The proliferation of such technologies to Pakistan is the subject of ongoing discussions between the United States and the Government of China. Unfortunately, the Chinese have given no sign that they intend to halt their highly dangerous trade in missile technologies and components. 
   Many Senators have expressed their concern over this practice, including the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, Mr. THOMPSON, and the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Mr. TORRICELLI. It is my intention, and my expectation, and it is the intention of my very close and dear colleague, Senator WARNER--it is our intention and expectation that the U.S.-China Security Review Commission will investigate, report and make recommendations on Chinese trade in missile components, which affects our long-term security and that of our Asian allies. In this amendment by Mr. WARNER and myself, both paragraphs (E), dealing with military actions taken by the Chinese Government, and (J), requiring an overall assessment of the state of the security challenges presented by China to the United States provide ample mandate to the commission to conduct such investigations on a regular basis. 
   I will be happy to yield the floor to my colleague, Mr. WARNER. 
   I cannot yield the floor to another Senator. I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am seriously concerned about Section 910 of S. 2549, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. 
   Section 910 would effect the transfer of responsibility for the National Guard Youth ChalleNGe program from the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to the Secretary of Defense and would amend the limitation on federal funding for the National Guard Challenge program to limit only Department of Defense funding. This language removes the National Guard Bureau from the ``chain of command'' and from its statutory role as the channel of communication between the federal government and the states (10 U.S.C. Sec. 10501). 
   Youth ChalleNGe exists in 25 states and is a federal/state partnership program. While there is partial federal funding (which is capped by law at $62.5 million per year), the ChalleNGe staff members are state employees who meet state teacher and counselor certification requirements. All legally binding cooperative agreements currently in place are between the Governors and the Chief, National Guard Bureau. 
   ChalleNGe is a highly successful program that takes at-risk youths and gives them the opportunity to turn their lives around and become productive members of their communities. Since the program was established, with my assistance in 1991, more than 4,500 young Americans have graduated. Of this number, more than 66% have earned their GED or high school diploma; more than 12% entered the military, and more than 16% enrolled in college. 
   ChalleNGe is a program in demand by the states. If it were not for the cap on spending, more states would have a ChalleNGe program. Transferring authority from the National Guard to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs could only have a negative impact and upset a program that is operating extremely well under the auspices of the National Guard Bureau. It would add another layer of bureaucracy and require the State National Guard programs to relate through an altogether new ``chain of command'' for the Youth ChalleNGe program, while maintaining the existing ``chain of command'' for all other National Guard activities. 
   On June 16th of this year, I participated in the graduation ceremony of the cadets of the Mountaineer ChalleNGe program at Camp Dawson, West Virginia. In all my years of delivering commencement speeches and high school diplomas, I can say without reservation that this was the most impressive group of students that I have ever encountered. The graduates sat at full attention throughout the event, with obvious pride in their hard-earned achievements and serious commitment to a future on the right path. Such transformation can not be achieved by mere bootcamp exercises alone. It takes a tough-love approach with caring and compassionate instructors who want to see the lives of these troubled youth turned around forever. The National Guard offers these young people  the very virtues--leadership, followership, community service, job skills, health and nutrition, and physical education--that are in keeping with the Guard's tradition of adding value to America and it certainly showed in West Virginia. 
   Let us not punish this fine organization which is doing an exceptional job in helping youth in-need.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it is a great pleasure to join with the distinguished Senator from Washington in presenting this bill. He is an extraordinarily fine chairman. I have chaired this subcommittee now for, oh, a good many years, but Senator GORTON is really one of the best subcommittee chairmen in this Senate. I say that without any hesitation. I have no compunctions about saying he is one of the finest chairmen with whom I have ever served in these 42 years in the Senate. 
   I mean every word of it. 
   I have found him always to be very courteous, very considerate, very cooperative; and he is this way with all Senators--not just with me but with all of our colleagues. I could not hope to have a better chairman than he. And if it were not for the honor that goes along with the chairmanship, I would just as soon he kept this. But there is a certain honor with it, so I look forward to the time when I will be chairman of the full committee and subcommittee again. But my hat is always off to this chairman, Senator GORTON. 
   This is an important piece of legislation that provides for the management of our natural resources, undertakes important energy research, supports vital Indian health and education programs, and works to protect and preserve our national and cultural heritage. It is a bill on which Senator GORTON and I cooperate very closely on a bipartisan basis. 
   We know no party in our relationship in this Senate. And that is said without any reservations whatsoever. There is no Republican Party, no Democratic Party where SLADE GORTON and I are concerned in working on this subcommittee. And I can say the same with respect to the full committee with respect to TED STEVENS, the distinguished Senator from Alaska. There is no party line in that committee.  
   The programs and activities funded under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee are treated in a fair and balanced way, as is customary for the annual Interior appropriations bills under the chairmanship of Senator SLADE GORTON. He is one of the best--if not the best--subcommittee chairman with whom I have had the opportunity to serve. The bill was reported unanimously by the committee, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage. 
   I will not repeat the summary of the bill just provided by the subcommittee chairman, except to say that, as it currently stands, this measure provides $15.4 billion in new discretionary budget authority. This amount, while less than the administration's request, is nevertheless $628 million above last year's enacted level. The bill, as reported by the committee, has fully utilized the subcommittee's entire 302(b) allocation of $15.4 billion in discretionary budget authority. Consequently, to remain consistent with the Budget Act, any amendments that propose increased funding will have to be fully offset. 
   So if any Senator has any amendment in mind that seeks to add money, that Senator or his staff, or both, should busy themselves about finding an offset because Peter is going to have to pay Paul in this instance. It is going to come out of somebody's funding, and I am determined it will not be mine. So I suggest that Senators look for an offset because they have to have it. 
   In terms of total spending, the Interior bill is by no means the largest of the 13 annual appropriations measures. Yet, despite its relatively modest size, the Interior appropriations bill commands significant attention from Members of the Senate. As is the case every year, the subcommittee received more than 2,000 Member requests seeking consideration of a particular project, or account, or activity under the jurisdiction of one agency or another in this bill. All of these requests are very important to our colleagues and the people that they represent. Unfortunately, because of the constrained spending level under the allocations provided to the Congress, it is not possible to adequately respond to all of these requests. That is what makes the crafting of this bill so difficult. Trying to balance the specific needs addressed by the Member requests on one hand, while remaining within the budgetary allocations on the other hand, is an arduous task, indeed--not as arduous, perhaps, as the problem that Solomon had, but sometimes I wonder. 
   Nevertheless, it is our responsibility--the responsibility of our chairman and myself--to undertake that very difficult assignment, and I commend him for his splendid efforts in meeting the highest priority needs of all Senators. For months now, he has gone to great lengths to work with me and to keep me informed, and to work with my staff to keep my staff informed, of his recommendations throughout the process of marking up and reporting this bill. Throughout this process, Senator GORTON's graciousness--that word is key, ``graciousness''--and his dedication to duty have never wavered, and I am personally grateful to him for all his courtesies. 
   I also express my appreciation to the fine staff members on the majority staff side, as well as members on the minority staff side. We have a new staff person on this side of the aisle--Peter Kiefhaber, German to the core, smart as they come, and hard working. That is what I like about him. He is hard working, he is courteous, and he is extremely efficient. 
   So with that, I think I shall join my chairman in asking Senators, if they have them, to bring their amendments to the floor. It would be my hope, as I used to do when I was chairman, to urge, with the approval of the chairman of the subcommittee, our floor staffs to contact Senators and see if they have any amendments. If they have them, let's draw up a list. Let's know which Senators have what amendments, and let's draw up a list. It would be my hope that at a time not too far away we could get unanimous consent that that be a finite list. Then we could go from there. 
   But I will not suggest that at the moment. I have not discussed that with the chairman. Whenever he is ready to ask his staff on that side of the aisle, I will do the same over here. We will have our leadership make calls to Senators and let us know if we are to anticipate any problems from them. If we are to anticipate such, let us know about it. And because we do have other business, we must get on with it. 
   I again thank my chairman, Mr. GORTON. I thank our staffs.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, tucked into a sheltered green valley in Southern West Virginia is a magical place, a place where fascinating history, natural majesty, and sumptuous comfort have combined since the first days of our nation's founding to create a spot that is justly world-renowned. That place, Mr. President, is called The Greenbrier, in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. It has been a special place for several decades now, overflowing with game for the Shawnee Indians, a spa since colonial days, a place of high society idylls and balls, fought over during the Civil War, a World War II diplomatic internment site and then a rest and recuperation hospital for wounded soldiers, and a secret government relocation site--all cloaked behind the well-bred, white-columned face of a grand southern belle of a resort. 
   Mr. President, in May, my wife Erma and I celebrated our 63rd anniversary. Erma is my childhood sweetheart, the former Erma Ora James. We have written a lot of history together over the past 63 years, and I could not ask for a better coauthor. 
   This year, as we have in the last several years, we celebrated at the fabled Greenbrier resort in White Sulphur Springs. I am certainly not original in my inspiration to celebrate moments of marital bliss there--President John Tyler, the first President to be married in office, 
   spent part of his 1844 honeymoon in White Sulphur Springs. Actors Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher spent part of their 1955 honeymoon there, and Mr. and Mrs. Joseph P. Kennedy arrived at the Greenbrier on October 11, 1914, for a two-week honeymoon. Many, many, other famous names are inscribed in the Greenbrier's guest register. The history that Erma and I have created together is a blink of the eye compared to that of The Greenbrier, whose healing waters were first enjoyed by hardy colonists in 1778, as they had been by Shawnee Indians for untold years before that. 
   The Greenbrier has been a resort almost since the day in 1778 that Mrs. Anderson, one of the first homesteaders in the Greenbrier area of the ``Endless Mountains,'' as the region was identified on colonial maps, first tested the wondrous mineral waters on her chronic rheumatism. Word of Mrs. Anderson's recovery spread rapidly, and numerous log cabins were soon erected near the spring. The ``summer season'' at the spring was born, albeit in a somewhat primitive state. 
   Still, the fame of the spring along Howard's Creek continued to spread. Thomas Jefferson mentioned ``Howard's Creek of Green Briar'' in his  ``Notes on the State of Virginia'' in 1784; that same year, George Washington focused the Virginia legislature's attention on the commercial prospects of the ``Old State Road'' running between the Kanawha River valley, through The Greenbrier's lands, to the piedmont and tidewater sections of Virginia. Along the route of today's roadway between the hotel and the golf clubhouse stands a monument to this vision. The Buffalo Trail monument commemorates the point at which the pre-colonial Indian Buffalo Trail crossed the Allegheny Mountains on its way from the Atlantic Coast to Ohio. This trail became the James River and Kanawha Turnpike, which for over a century carried commerce and development from the settled East to the future states of West Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri. By 1809, a tavern with a dining room, a barn, a stable, mills, and numerous cabins constituted a hospitable stopping place along the still-rugged route West. And rheumatism sufferers were joined at this watering hole by others more interested in the creature comforts and social interaction than in relieving joint pain. 
   By 1815, the first spring house was built over the spring head, and a thriving resort was attracting visitors who typically stayed for several weeks at a time. A hotel and many surrounding cottages, some quite sumptuous, were erected over the years. Commodore Stephen Decatur, hero of the Barbary Wars, brought his wife for a 16-day stay in 1817, and Henry Clay of Kentucky, Speaker of the House of Representatives, spent some time at White Sulphur Springs during several summers over some 30 years. The cool mountain breezes under the shelter of ancient oaks, combined with stylish fans and gentle rocking chairs on a shady porch, made the Greenbrier a comfortable spot in those sweltering summers before air conditioning. 
   In many ways, the Greenbrier has changed little over the years. The gracious sweep of lawn, the stately trees, the ranks of white cottages and imposing hotel facades hark back to that earlier era. Many of the cottages, most too sumptuous to be called merely ``cottages,'' have their own special histories. One of the cottages was owned by Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte, who was a nephew of the French Emperor. General John J. Pershing, Commander of the Allied Forces in World War I completed his memoirs in the cottage named ``Top Notch.'' Early morning horseback rides are still popular, and Erma and I recently enjoyed the romantic carriage ride through the grounds. Hunting, fishing, and even falconry are still practiced. But more golf courses, tennis courts, and swimming pools encourage a more active lifestyle than in those early days. The Greenbrier is justly famous for its golf and for the Sam Snead Golf School. Though I do not play, I still enjoy the beautifully landscaped courses with their wide sweeps of lawn and water dotted with sandy island obstacles. The partaking of the sulfur water, that elemental component of the original spa experience, is now complemented by health and beauty facilities and services that pamper every part of you. A visit to the Greenbrier has grown ever more restorative over the years. 
   Henry Clay, that great man from Kentucky, the State of the Senator who now presides over the Senate with a dignity and degree of charm and skill and poise as rare as a day in June, often visited at the Greenbrier, as I have said. 
   Henry Clay was an early political fan of the Greenbrier, surely the most gracious and comfortable stopping place on his many trips between Washington and his home in Kentucky. Other well-known figures and luminaries who visited the resort prior to the Civil War were Presidents Martin Van Buren, Andrew Jackson, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, and James Buchanan. I have already noted that President John Tyler honeymooned at the Greenbrier. Dolly Madison, Daniel Webster, Davy Crockett, Francis Scott Key, and John C. Calhoun, and many other political notables have also contributed to engrossing dinner conversations there in more recent years, including Senate greats such as Everett Dirksen, Sam Ervin, Jacob Javits, and Barry Goldwater. Other politicians preferred the outstanding golf at the resort, including President Eisenhower, President Nixon (as a Vice President), and Vice President Hubert Humphrey. President Woodrow Wilson has also graced the Greenbrier, though I do not know if he was a golfer. 
   The Greenbrier has always been a favorite spot of other celebrities, as well. The Vanderbilts, Astors, Hearsts, Forbes, Luces, DuPonts, and the Kennedys have sojourned there, as did Prince Ranier and Princess Grace with their children Albert and Caroline. The Duke and Duchess of Windsor danced the night away in the grand ballroom. Bing Crosby has sung there, and Johnny Carson, Steve Allen, Dr. Norman Vincent Peale, Rudi Valle, Art Buchwald, Dr. Jonas Salk, Cyrus Eaton, and the Reverend Billy Graham have all made mealtime conversations there sparkle more than the crystal chandeliers in the dining room. Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig are just two of the sporting greats who have autographed the guest register. Clare Booth Luce wrote the first draft of her most enduring play, ``The Women'', during a three-day stay in 1936. Like Tennyson's brook, the fascinating list of notables could go on and on forever. People watching--that is watching people--has always been a spectator sport at Greenbrier functions! 
   The Greenbrier has experienced trauma as well as galas. During the Civil War, the Greenbrier's location astride a strategic rail line into Richmond, Virginia, put her in the line of fire. Troops were billeted in her guest rooms, but both sides spared a favorite pre-war vacation site and fighting raged along the Greenbrier River. Being in what became Southern West Virginia, during the debate over succession in 1863, the Greenbrier's fate as a West Virginia or a Virginia citizen was uncertain. I am surely glad that West Virginia was the winner! 
   During Reconstruction, the hotel's healing waters also helped to heal the wounds of war, as grand society from both sides of the conflict continued to meet at the Greenbrier. General Robert E. Lee was a frequent visitor. In General Robert E. Lee's single post-war political statement, he led a group of prominent Southern leaders vacationing at the Greenbrier in drafting and signing what became known as ``The White Sulphur Manifesto'' of 1868. This document, widely reprinted in newspapers across the country, declared that, in the minds of these men, questions of secession from the Union and slavery ``were decided by war,'' and that, upon the reestablishment of self-governance in the South, the Southern people would ``faithfully obey the Constitution and laws of the 
   United States, treat the Negro populations with kindness and humanity and fulfill every duty incumbent on peaceful citizens, loyal to the Constitution of their country.'' The war was truly over. 
   In 1869, one of the most famous photographs ever taken at White Sulphur Springs included Robert E. Lee and a group of former Confederate Generals, among them Henry Wise of Virginia, P.G.T. Beauregard of Louisiana, and Bankhead Magruder of Virginia. Other ex-Confederate officers who visited the resort were Alexander Lawton of Georgia, Joseph Brent of Maryland, James Conner of South Carolina, Martin Gary of South Carolina, and Robert Lilley of Virginia. Former Union General William S. Rosecrans visited General Lee while Lee was vacationing one summer at the Greenbrier. 
   The Greenbrier has served the nation well in two other wars, as well--World War II and the Cold War. At the outbreak of World War II, the hotel served as a rather gilded cage for several thousand foreign diplomats and their families, from Germany, Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria, and, later, Japan. It was then taken over by the federal government for the Army's use as a rest and recuperation hospital for wounded soldiers, before returning, like the soldiers it housed, to civilian life. 
   Much has been made, in recent years, of the Greenbrier's secret life as a covert agent of the U.S. government. In 1992, the existence of an emergency government relocation center built secretly deep beneath the Greenbrier was revealed. The result of an extraordinary partnership between the CSX Corporation and the federal government, the bunker contained facilities to house and operate the entire United States Congress in the event of nuclear attack. It had its origin in plans created by President Eisenhower to ensure  the survival of the constitutional system of checks and balances. The President had to convince Congressional leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson, to go along with the plan, which was carried out in the greatest secrecy for over forty years. The secrecy was necessary, because the bunker at the Greenbrier was not designed to withstand a direct hit, but, rather, to ensure security through a combination of physical design and camouflage. The remote shelter of the West Virginia hills proved a perfect combination of cover, concealment, and denial. 
   Now, the bunker is open to the public for tours. It is fascinating to see the level of detail that was included in the bunker, but it is also sobering to reflect upon the real fear of Armageddon that existed in this country during those years and which justified this kind of contingency planning. As you finish the tour and return to the sunlit world of golf, lazy country walks, luxurious settings, and fine dining that is the hallmark of the Greenbrier experience, it is difficult to recall those not-so-distant times when school children practiced hiding under their desks in the event of a conventional or nuclear exchange. 
   I encourage my fellow Senators, and, indeed, anyone listening, to visit the Greenbrier, to tour the bunker, and to relish the history and the service that are so much a part of this precious piece of West Virginia. Avoid the current high gas prices and road congestion, and take the train as so many have before you. Leave steamy, contentious, Washington behind for a time, and step out at the Greenbrier's rail depot wondering at the beauty, the cool breezes that smell of fresh, clean air and wildflowers. Allow yourself to be swept along by the attentive, unobtrusive service of an earlier age and be deposited in a bright, flower-bedecked room before a pre-dinner stroll about the grounds. 
   You will be walking with the celebrities of the past as you write a wonderful new chapter in your own history. 
   I was mentioning the Amtrak train. My recollection went back to a time in England when the distinguished Senator from Washington, SLADE GORTON, and his nice wife Sally, and Erma and I rode the train from London up to York. Oh, my, what a wonderful time we had in York, visiting through the countryside with its narrow roads and its hedges and having our meetings with the British. Those were most enjoyable days and memorable ones. 
   But riding the train in itself is a real treat. I like to ride trains, and I know SLADE GORTON does, too. Has he ever told about his bicycle journey across the United States? He and his wife and their children traveled by bicycle, a bicycle odyssey, across the United States of America, all the way from the Pacific to the Atlantic. That would be something worth reading about. Better still, talk with him in person about it. 
   I close with the immortal words and images of the poet William Wordsworth, who lived from 1770 to 1850, when the Greenbrier was yet in its early days. But his lines eloquently capture the sights one can now happen upon when strolling through the magical grounds of this wonderful outpost of gentle civilization amid the mountains, and they capture the happiness such beauty inspires: 
 I wandered lonely as a cloud That floats on high o'er vales and hills, When all at once I saw a crowd, A host, of golden daffodils; Beside the lake, beneath the trees, Fluttering and dancing in the breeze. 
 Continuous as the stars that shine And twinkle on the milky way, They stretched in never-ending line Along the margin of a bay: Ten thousand saw I at a glance, Tossing their heads in sprightly dance. 
 The waves beside them danced; but they Out-did the sparkling waves in glee: A poet could not but be gay, In such a jocund company: I gazed--and gazed--but little thought What wealth the show to me had brought: 
 For oft, when on my couch I lie In vacant or in pensive mood, They flash upon that inward eye Which is the bliss of solitude; And then my heart with pleasure fills, And dances with the daffodils.  
   Like the Greenbrier, the forests in West Virginia. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I support the Fiscal Year 2001 appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies. 
   This measure increases funding for education programs by $4.6 billion from $37,924,569,000 to $42,594,646,000. This increase includes funds to provide for a $350 dollar increase in the maximum Pell Grant award, up to a maximum of $3,650 dollars. The bill also includes an increase of $1.3 billion for special education programs, raising the total appropriations for such purposes from $6,036,196,000 to $7,352,341,000. Furthermore, for the first time, this bill enables local education agencies to use Title VI funds for school modernization and class-size reduction efforts, if they so choose. 
   I am pleased that the bill contains over $40 million in funding for the Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarship program. As the only merit-based scholarship program funded by the Department of Education, this program awards scholarships to high school graduates who demonstrate outstanding academic achievement and have been accepted to attend an institution of higher learning. 
   The bill includes nearly a million dollars for the continuation of a program to identify and provide models of alcohol prevention and education in higher education. Alcohol abuse is a devastating problem on college campuses across America, and I hope that this program will provide incentives and form the basis for colleges and universities to better address the problem of alcohol abuse on their campuses. 
   I note that the bill includes a $1.2 billion initiative to address the problem of youth violence, which is also a major national concern. This spring, at West Virginia University, I convened a Youth Summit on Violence that was designed to give young people an opportunity to put forth their ideas on how to reduce violence among their peers. In response to the question, ``What would best prevent violence in the schools?''--the number one response from these young people was to create safe places where they can gather for social activities after school. In that regard, I am pleased that the bill includes $600 million for the 21st Century Learning Centers Program. That very important program supports grants to local education agencies for the purpose of establishing after-school programs. 
   The bill contains nearly $250 million for the Mine Safety and Health Administration, and an increase of $2.5 million above the President's request for the Mine Health and Safety Academy. This agency is vital when it comes to protecting the health and safety of our nation's miners. The measure also contains $6 million for black lung clinics, which play a critical role in providing medical treatment to coal miners suffering from black lung disease. 
   Further, the bill includes more than $200 million for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Important research conducted at NIOSH adds to our understanding of occupation-related ailments and diseases. 
   In conclusion, Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the Chairman and Ranking Member, Senators SPECTER and HARKIN, for their efforts in putting together this very important funding bill. These two Senators are vastly experienced and knowledgeable when it comes to matters under the jurisdiction of the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Subcommittee. They have worked on a bipartisan basis splendidly, as is always the case, preparing this Fiscal Year 2001 appropriations bill. 
   I also wish to express my appreciation to Senators SPECTER and HARKIN for facilitating the inclusion of my amendment into the managers' package. My amendment provides $50 million to the Secretary of Education to award grants to states to develop, implement, and strengthen programs that teach American history as a separate subject within school curricula. The importance of America history is too often undervalued in our nation's classrooms. Poll after poll in recent years has alerted us to huge gaps in historical knowledge among our nation's schoolchildren. It is my hope that this amendment will encourage teachers and students to take a deeper look at the importance of our nation's past. 
   Again, I wish to compliment the two fine managers of the bill and the Appropriations staff who have assisted them with preparing the bill. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate will soon take up the FY 2001 Military Construction Conference Report. In addition to meeting the military construction needs of the nation, Divisions B & C contain emergency supplemental appropriations for FY 2000 totaling some $11.2 billion. 
   The supplemental portion of the bill funds a broad array of urgently needed programs. More than $6 billion is provided for the emergency needs of the military. Of that amount, some $2 billion is to cover the cost of our peacekeeping operations in Kosovo; $1.6 billion is to recover increased fuel costs to the military; and $1.3 billion is for health benefits for the military. For the victims of natural disasters, particularly those who suffered the ravages of Hurricane Floyd, some $300 million is provided. And, $350 million is provided in emergency funds to replenish the fire management accounts of the Department of the Interior and U.S. Forest Service. Those firefighting accounts are totally depleted and must be replenished immediately. The bill also provides $600 million in Low Income Home Energy Assistance grants, and more than $600 million is provided to address the costs related to the disastrous fire at Los Alamos, New Mexico. 
   One of the biggest pieces of the supplemental package is $1.3 billion to fully fund the President's request in support of Plan Colombia. The President's anti-drug initiative is an ambitious effort in support of Plan Colombia, a massive undertaking by the Colombian government to fight the alarming rise of heroin and cocaine production and trafficking in Colombia. 
   The intent of the President's aid package to Colombia is laudable; but at this point, there remain more questions than answers as to what the impact of this assistance will be. Our efforts in the past have done little, if anything, to deter Colombia's drug lords. The production of cocaine and heroin has skyrocketed. Some analysts are concerned that increased U.S. involvement in Colombia's drug wars will  fuel an all-out civil war in a country already ravaged by guerrilla warfare and paramilitary abuses. 
   For those reasons, I am pleased that this conference report preserves a provision that I originally added in the Senate Appropriations Committee to place restrictions on future funding for U.S. assistance to Plan Colombia, and to limit the number of U.S. military personnel and U.S. civilian contractors that can be deployed in Colombia to support the counter-narcotics effort. 
   The Byrd provision requires the Administration to seek and receive congressional authorization before spending any money on U.S. support for Plan Colombia beyond the funding contained in this supplemental package and other relevant funding bills. The President's request for Plan Colombia is fully funded. This provision simply ensures that, if additional funding is requested to prolong or expand U.S. involvement in Colombia's anti-drug campaign, Congress will have the opportunity to review and evaluate the entire program before green-lighting more money. 
   The goal of my provision is to prevent an incremental and possibly unintended escalation of U.S. involvement in Colombia's war on drugs to the point that the United States, over time, finds itself entangled beyond extraction in the internal politics of Colombia. We cannot ignore the fact that Colombia is embroiled in a civil war, and that narco-guerrillas, who are better-trained, better-financed, and better-equipped than the Colombian army, control much of the country. The government of Colombia is fighting a just, but uphill battle. The United States, in this funding package, is making a major commitment to help Colombia. With the Byrd provision, we are also making a commitment to the people of the United States that Congress will stand guard against this nation's being unwittingly drawn too deeply into Colombia's internal problems. 
   Mr. President, this Administration has, in the past, registered strong opposition to the Byrd provision. I assure the Senate that we have listened to the concerns expressed by the Administration, and have addressed them. We doubled the cap on U.S. military personnel to 500, as requested by the Pentagon, and tripled the allowable number of U.S. civilian contractors to 300. We exempted funding for on-going counter-narcotics programs covered in other appropriations bills, as requested by the Administration. We addressed virtually every issue raised by the Administration, and I hope that the President is ready to endorse this language. 
   It is my opinion that the Administration should welcome the spotlight that this provision will shine on the level of U.S. participation in Plan Colombia. The Administration should also welcome the additional safeguards that this language provides to reduce the possibility of unbridled mission creep and unforeseen consequences. 
   There are some who have expressed concern that this language is too restrictive, and that it will impose too difficult a process to allow the United States to continue its efforts to fight drug production and drug trafficking in Colombia and throughout the region. I believe the process should be restrictive. I do not believe that U.S. assistance to Plan Colombia should be handled on a business-as-usual basis. The political situation in Colombia is too unstable, and the risks to American citizens involved in the counter-narcotics campaign are too high. 
   That said, my provision is not intended to slam the door on future counter-narcotics assistance to Colombia or to other countries in the region, if such assistance is needed and warranted. The war on drugs must be waged aggressively, both at home and abroad. At this point, the President has requested a specific level of funding, $1.3 billion, to finance a specific program. Congress is providing that funding in this appropriations measure. If this President, or a future President, seeks more money, or seeks to broaden or prolong U.S. involvement in Plan Colombia, we merely ask him to present that request to Congress, and to give Congress the opportunity to review, assess, and authorize the entire program. What we do not want to see is U.S. assistance to Plan Colombia quietly ramped up through regular or supplemental funding bills until we suddenly reach the point of having thousands of U.S. citizens deployed to Colombia, and billions of U.S. tax dollars invested in Colombia's drug war, and no way to extricate the United States from Colombia. 
   Mr. President, Congress has a responsibility to exercise oversight over programs such as U.S. participation in Plan Colombia. This provision ensures that we will have the opportunity to exercise that oversight, and to make an informed and deliberate decision on future funding for Plan Colombia. It is a wise precaution to include in a package that will underwrite a costly, complicated, and unprecedented assault on a dangerous and determined enemy.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, having been the Senate Democratic leader, I know that there comes a moment in time when leaders have to step in and act. Our two leaders did that at the critical moment. It is through their leadership that we have reached an understanding in this matter. I thank both leaders. I congratulate them on having done a great service. I say this: Every Senator is in their debt. 
   I also thank my colleague and friend, Senator STEVENS, for the leadership he has shown in these appropriations matters. 
   I hope that both of our leaders, in particular, and all of our colleagues will have a very safe and enjoyable Fourth of July.

   Mr. BYRD. Please tell your handsome grandson, who has been blessed with a multitude of talents, I am sure, that this year is not the beginning of the 21st century. Tell him it is not the beginning of the third millennium. This is the last year of the 20th century. Regardless of what the media say and many politicians say, this is the last year of the 20th century and the last year of the second millennium. 
   Let him know that, so that he will be raised in truth and will always seek truth.

   Mr. BYRD. I thank the chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee for the excellent work they have consistently given to this legislation, the many times they have brought it to the floor of the Senate. The distinguished Senator from Virginia, Mr. WARNER, and I worked together on several amendments. I am always happy to have his cooperation and his cosponsorship. He is a man whose heart is as stout as an Irish oak and as pure as the Lakes of Killarney. 
   As to the distinguished ranking member, the Bible says: Seest thou a  man diligent in his business? He shall stand before Kings. Senator LEVIN has already stood before Kings and will probably stand before more if there are any left.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in a few short days, our Nation will celebrate for the 224th time the signing of the Declaration of Independence. For some, the occasion will take on an unwarranted special significance because there are people who have been led to believe--in some cases misled, I would say--that this is the first Independence Day of the new millennium. For them, the celebration requires extra fanfare, even more spectacular displays of fireworks, and an even bigger party, akin to the gala bashes of last New Year's Eve. However, in reality, the millennial Independence Day celebration coincides with the 225th anniversary of the signing next year, in 2001. So I, at least, will reserve my extra sparklers and Roman candles for next year. 
   I will not, however, let any confusion over the new century/new millennium stand in the way of one of my favorite holidays. The Fourth of July is a standout. It is one of the few holidays still celebrated on the actual anniversary of the day, as opposed to being appended to a weekend for convenience's sake. Though sales may beckon from nearby shopping malls, the holiday is not obscured beneath any major sporting event. 
   There are no 4th of July college football championships, no basketball finals, no baseball World Series games to divide families into the camps of the spectators and the ignored. The 4th of July is instead, typically, celebrated by families and friends in the great beauty of the outdoors. 
   Some years, the weather is perfect, with blue skies, moderate temperatures and low humidity, when the American flags are fanned by gentle breezes--the kind of a day that fills me with a sense of exhilaration and anticipation. Other years, the weather is almost unbearably hot and sticky, the flag hangs limply from the pole, and sun screen mingles with sweat to turn picnickers into melting human popsicles. But even these sweltering days can be relieved by mimicking childrens' refreshing runs through a water sprinkler arcing manmade rainbows across the yard, or by dousing the heat with gallons of tart lemonade and sweet watermelon chilled in a tub of ice. On summer days like these, people still resort to rocking chairs on porches and paper fans waved lazily before faces, much as they did when I was a boy in the days before air conditioning. 
   The highlight of the day, is, of course, the fireworks. My favorite time of this holiday comes as the temperatures cool and the skies darken, and the fireflies' display hints of the light show to come. I cannot wait to see my little great-granddaughter Caroline's expression as she is presented with the mysteries of smoke worms, sparklers, and Roman candles. I hope that she will not be so afraid of the explosive booms of the big fireworks that she cannot enjoy the fiery display, the cascades of red, blue, green, and golden sparks drifting down over our heads. 
   It is alright for her to be afraid, of course. After all, those fireworks, so festive now, recall the great battles fought by our young nation to gain its independence from mighty Britain. Two-hundred and twenty-four years ago, on a similar hot summer night, little Caroline's patriotic forbearers might have feared for their lives as the cannons boomed and the flintlocks cracked. The parades we watch today are a faint reminder of the lines of troops that may have tramped with grim faces through colonial towns on their way to battle with the redcoats. So it is, perhaps, good to be a little afraid when watching 4th of July fireworks. It may be the closest many of our children come to reliving this important time in the history of our Republic. 
   Probably most children watching 4th of July fireworks do not fully understand the link between the holiday and this day in our nation's past. That our children know little about history is not news. Poll after poll in recent years has alerted us to huge gaps in historical knowledge among our nation's schoolchildren. Once again, a recent test of young peoples' knowledge of history, in this case, the history of our own nation, has demonstrated a sorry--and if I may add--scandalous ignorance. What is disconcerting about this most recent report is that it reflects the knowledge base of college seniors from some of the best colleges and universities in the nation, not younger children with many years of learning still ahead of them. 
   If those who do not learn from history are truly doomed to repeat it, then I shudder to think how much our future might resemble that silly movie, ``Groundhog Day.'' 
   The test, sponsored by the American Council of Trustees and Alumni, and administered by the University of Connecticut, consisted of asking college seniors at 55 top colleges and universities some 34 questions from a high school-level American history test. I was very sorry to read that nearly 80 percent of those tested earned only a ``D'' or an ``F.'' A mere 23 percent could identify James Madison as the principal framer of the Constitution. More than a third did not know that the Constitution established the division of powers in American government. Just 60 percent could correctly select the 50-year period in which the Civil War occurred. 
   Imagine that. Just 60 percent could correctly select--in other words, 40 percent could not correctly select--the 50-year period in which the Civil War occurred--not the correct years, or even the correct decade, but the correct half century! A scant 35 percent could correctly name the President in office at the start of the Korean War. It was, for the record, President Truman. 
   But, 99 percent of these college seniors correctly identified Beavis and Butthead as television cartoon characters. That is a sorry commentary, indeed. Years of experts advising parents to limit and monitor their children's time in front of the television, and to encourage their children to stretch their minds by reading or their muscles by playing outdoors, have come to this--a nation of increasingly overweight children who spend increasing numbers of hours watching moronic and scatological so-called humor on television and who do not learn the history behind some of the most fundamental tenets underlying our system of government. It is a disgrace--a colossal disgrace. Perhaps we should attempt to restrict books and learning, in order to make them more desirable ``forbidden fruits'' in our children's eyes. 
   I do not want to put the blame for this sad state of affairs entirely on parents or even on our lowest-common-denominator-seeking entertainment industry. Another recent review, this time, of high school textbooks by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, slammed biology and science textbooks, in particular, as missing the big picture behind the four basic ideas driving today's cutting edge research. Not one of the two dozen biology texts reviewed by the group, which are aimed at grades 9-12, were considered excellent or satisfactory. Other reviews in the past of history books have illustrated similar deficiencies. I fear that we are nowhere close to answering the century-plus old prayer by Charles Kingsley--``I hope that my children, at least, if not I myself, will see the day when ignorance of the primary laws and facts of science will be looked upon as a defect only second to ignorance of the primary laws of religion and morality.'' We are, instead, closer to fulfilling the prediction by Robert A. Heinlein that ``A generation which ignores history has no past--and no future.'' 
   In light of this dismal knowledge of our national history, I have today offered an amendment to the Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Bill to provide $50 million--just a little seed corn--to the Secretary of Education to award grants to states to develop, implement, and strengthen programs that teach American history as a separate subject within school curricula. 
   It doesn't mean social studies. That is about all they have today. Some people look upon social studies and claim that is history. I have nothing against social studies, except it is not history. What I am suggesting here by way of this $50 million amendment is that the  Secretary of Education award grants to States to develop, implement, and strengthen programs that teach American history--not social studies. The schools may, if they wish, teach social studies. But this is American history as a separate subject within the school curriculum. The importance of American history is too often undervalued in our nation's classrooms. As I have already indicated, poll after poll in recent years has alerted us to huge gaps in historical knowledge among our nation's schoolchildren. It is my hope that this amendment will encourage teachers and students to take a deeper look at the importance of our nation's past.

   ``The Search for Jesus'' 
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>106-byrd-wv-3-20000629</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I found disappointing Peter Jennings' ``The Search for Jesus,'' which aired on ABC Monday night. The promotions for the show promised a pilgrimage to the roots of Christianity, but I think what we were actually given was more of a slide show. 
   All too often we are told by members of the media that they are constrained by time. Broadcasters divvy up air time into 30 seconds, 60 seconds, an hour, 2 hours, and they are constrained by these blocks, which are further constrained by their ability to sell advertisements to support their use of time. 
   In case after case, including that of ``The Search for Jesus,'' too little time is devoted to providing a serious look at important issues. Whatever one's view of Jesus may be, it is hard to deny that few, if any, other lives have so affected our world and humanity as that of Jesus Christ. Here is someone who literally split the centuries in two. 
   The questions and controversies surrounding His life on Earth certainly deserve more than the 2 hours devoted to it by ABC. Two hours--in fact, much less than that when one subtracts the commercial time, which was substantial--hardly scratches the surface. 
   The program presented many provocative ideas. A very limited number of theologians, historians, and ordinary folk had much to offer in the way of researched information, speculation, theory, heartfelt notions, and simple faith. But they were given only seconds here and there to provide us with what may well have been valuable insight and inspirational ideas. If there is a topic that deserves plenty of time, this is it. And, I daresay, as much as it may also cause what to many, including myself, is a distasteful commercialization of religion, this is a topic for which I assume the network easily sold loads of advertising time--as apparently it did for the broadcast Monday night. In this case, what actually aired was light on substance, but heavy on  advertising, giving the effort the appearance, at the very least, of a high-toned money grab. 
   I cannot be sure what motivated the show, ``The Search for Jesus.'' Evidently, Peter Jennings and staff spent months preparing for it, conducting interviews, researching, and traveling to Biblical sites. But viewers were certainly done a disservice by the encapsulated version that the network provided. As much as any journalist may try to let others do the talking, to give the experts the floor, and to present a rounded, unbiased view, when it comes right down to it, the finished piece--except on very rare occasions--reflects the decisions, good or bad, of producers and editors who must slice and trim to make their program fit into the time frame relegated to it by the network. 
   The show's conclusion--that Jesus was a man, that he existed--comes as no revelation to anyone who has lost someone dear and found solace only in the Trinity. As the program noted, there were others before and during His time who professed to be the messiah. They came and went, sometimes by execution, and their followers were either executed alongside their leaders or they found new ``messiahs'' in whom to place their faith. But, as the ABC show noted, Jesus was an exception. There was something extraordinary--one might say miraculous--in the way that His death promoted the proliferation of His teachings, and in the fact that, nearly 2,000 years after His crucifixion, He continues to inspire followers around the world. 
   There is, indeed, no need to go to the Middle East to find Jesus. He can be found in any West Virginia hamlet or hollow. He can be found in the arid West, among towering urban buildings, and along peaceful ocean shores. 
   In the words of Job, that ancient man of Uz, ``Oh that my words were now written! Oh that they were printed in a book! That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever! For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that He shall stand at the latter day upon the earth.'' 
   I do not judge the intentions or the views of those who helped to put together ``The Search for Jesus'' program, but I know exactly where to place my faith.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I think it would be appropriate at this moment for me to say that this Presiding Officer, Senator PAT ROBERTS, is one of the best among the Presiding Officers in the Senate today. He pays attention to what is going on on the floor. Even though there may not be much going on, he is alert to what is happening on the floor. 
   This is the premier upper Chamber in the world today. There are 61 nations in the world that have bicameral legislative bodies today. All the others have unicameral legislative bodies. But the U.S. Senate and the Italian Senate are the only bicameral legislative bodies in the world today in which the upper Chamber is not dominated by the lower Chamber. 
   It is so important that this Senate be seen as a model, as a Senate in which there is decorum and order, a Senate which reveres the Chair and respects the Chair. This is one reason why I have been, of late, urging the Chair to maintain order in the well of the Senate. Now, 59 Senators out of 100 Senators today came to this body after I was majority leader of the Senate. Almost 60 percent of the Senators here today were not Members of this body when I was last majority leader of the body. 
   Now, what I look upon as some disorder in the Senate is when Senators get into the well and mill around. It really looks like the floor of the stock exchange, and it does not bring credit upon the Senate. I am sure that many senates throughout the States of this Nation look at this Senate as the model, look at this Senate as the body from which all senates should learn. But I fear that they see just the opposite. 
   I have been in the State legislature in my own State, and I have been in both houses. I have to say, frankly, that the decorum, the order within the House of Delegates in West Virginia and in the West Virginia Senate is far more to be desired than we find in that U.S. Senate. This is a situation that has really developed only during the last 10 or 12 years. I am sure that as the 59 out of the 100 Senators who came here following my last turn at the wheel as majority leader see this disorder in the Senate, where so many Senators gather in the well and they talk and they laugh and make a great deal of noise, these newest Senators probably believe that is the way it has always been. They may believe that is just normal for the Senate. But it is not. 
   I cannot imagine Senator Wallace Bennett, Senator George Aiken, Senator Norris Cotton, Senator Everett Dirksen, Senator Richard Russell, Senator Stuart Symington, Senator John Pastore, or Senator Joseph O'Mahoney going into the well. These were the Senators who were in this body when I came here. Senators didn't go down into the well and mill around in those days. Oh, they walked through the well, or they might walk up to the table and ask something about the vote, or they might walk up to the Parliamentarian and make some 
   inquiry; but they didn't gather in the well and carry on long conversations. They sat in their seats. Most of them knew how they were going to vote before they came to the floor. They had already been advised by their staffs or they studied the legislation. So they didn't go into the well. I think that looks bad upon the Senate. 
   I don't think the Senate sets a good example when we are so oblivious to how the Senate appears to the people who are watching their televisions sets or to the people in the galleries. Hundreds of thousands of people come to Washington every year, and many of them sit in the Senate galleries and watch the Senate. I wonder what is going through their minds when they see these Senators come in here and gather in the well and carry on loud conversations. How different it is when Senators, upon occasion, sit in their seats. How very impressive it is when the U.S. Senate acts in accordance with the standing orders and rules of the Senate. 
   It is the duty of the Chair to maintain order in the Senate and, of course, when there is confusion that arises in the galleries, it is the duty of the Chair--without being asked from the floor, without a point of order being made from the floor--to maintain order and decorum in the Senate. 
   I am trying to get the Senate to think about this and go back to the old ways, wherein Senators voted and then went to their chairs, or they voted from their desks. There is a standing order of the Senate that requires Senators to vote from their desks. I don't intend to be set-jawed about it, and if Senators want to walk through the well to see what it is we are voting on, or if they want to vote from someplace other than their own desks, I have no quarrel with that. But I think they ought to sit down. There are plenty of places where Senators can converse. We can go to the respective Cloakrooms, or we can walk outside the Chamber. So it isn't that Senators are required to avoid speaking to one another in the Chamber. We ought to be conscious that this Senate is the model--or it should be. 
   I hope Senators will read what I have said. They see me insist on the well's being cleared and they may think I am trying to run the Senate. Of course, I am not. I want people to revere the Senate and respect the Senate. If they respect this body, they will have more respect for the laws that we enact. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time I have taken not be charged against my request thus far.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the strength of this Nation lies in its people. Throughout our Nation's history, American men and women have been called upon time and time again to serve the Nation in times of peril. These men and women, at great risk to themselves and without regard to their personal safety, have given their all for their Country. These are the true heroes of America. 
   We have some of such heroes in this body who have given so very much for their country--Senator MAX CLELAND,  Senator BOB KERREY; there are others. But today I speak of one such American hero, our esteemed colleague, DANIEL INOUYE. 
   Like many others in this body, I have always thought of Senator INOUYE as a national hero. I know of his wartime heroics in France and Italy during World War II. I know of how he fought to protect the troops with whom he served, without regard for his own life. Even though gravely wounded, Lieutenant DANIEL INOUYE continued to fight, advancing alone against a machine-gun nest that had his men pinned down. I know that, upon returning home, DAN INOUYE spent twenty months in Army hospitals after losing his right arm. He came home as a Captain, with a Distinguished Service Cross, a Bronze Star, a Purple Heart with cluster, and twelve other medals and citations. 
   After receiving his law degree at George Washington University Law School, DANNY broke into politics in 1954 with his election to the Territorial House of Representatives. After Hawaii became a State on August 21, 1959, DANNY INOUYE won election to the United States House of Representatives as Hawaii's first Congressman, and was re-elected to a full term in 1960. In 1962, he was elected to represent Hawaii in the United States Senate. 
   I am proud to say that I am one who voted for statehood on behalf of both Alaska 
   and Hawaii. I believe that I am the only Senator still serving here today who voted for statehood for both of these states. I am very proud of having done that. I believe that I am also one of only three members of today's Senate who were here when DAN INOUYE joined this body in 1963. 
   I have had the pleasure of working with DANNY INOUYE on many, many occasions over the years. He is a man of utmost integrity, who works tirelessly on behalf of his constituents and on behalf of the Nation. He is one Senator who was extremely supportive of me during my service as Majority Leader, as Minority Leader, as Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and now as the Committee's Ranking Member. He is a Senator on whom I have relied for truth, for integrity, for steadfastness, for forthrightness, and as one who is highly dedicated to his work here in the Senate.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the amendment I am proposing would provide $8.5 million to the Department of Defense under the heading ``Military Construction, Defense-wide'' for classified activities, to remain available until expended. The entire amount would be designated as an emergency requirement and would be available only to the extent that an official budget request for $8.5 million is transmitted by the President to the Congress. These funds would be used for the conduct of a utility and feasibility study referenced under the heading of ``Management of MASINT'' in Senate Report 106-279. I am constrained from speaking further about this matter due to the nature of the classification of the amendment. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the foreign operations appropriations bill that the Senate completed debate on today contains $934 million to launch a major counter-narcotics initiative in Colombia. Other financing attached to the Military Construction and Defense Appropriations bills boosts that total to well over a billion dollars. 
   This funding will enable the United States to embark on a massive ramping up of its counter-narcotics offensive in Colombia. But curiously enough, the bulk of this program is being implemented through a series of supplemental funding measures. A major anti-narcotics program in Central America, anchored on the provision of U.S. military equipment and U.S. military and State Department advisers, seems to me to be a policy issue that begs for in depth Congressional discussion and consideration. And yet, we are effectively creating it through supplemental appropriations. This may be an expedient way to deal with a difficult problem, but I question its efficacy. I wholeheartedly support aggressive counter-narcotics efforts. Illegal drugs and drug abuse are scourges on our society, and we cannot pretend that the problem will go away if we simply ignore it. But I am concerned about the large number of unanswered questions surrounding the President's plan. 
   I understand where the money is to be spent, and what it is to be spent on, but I am unclear as to what the results are expected to be. What precise impact is the U.S. assistance expected to have on the production of cocaine and heroin into the United States? What impact will massive U.S. assistance to Colombia have on drug production in other Andean Ridge nations? What impact will intensified U.S. assistance to the government of Colombia's have on Colombia's internal politics and simmering civil war? And, most importantly, what impact will this initiative have on reducing drug abuse and the toll of the illegal drug trade within the United States. 
   Providing answers to those, and other questions, is the primary intent of a provision that I added in Committee to the foreign operations appropriations bill. My provision requires the Administration to seek and receive congressional authorization before spending any money on U.S. support for the counter-narcotics program in Colombia, called Plan Colombia, beyond the funding contained in this and other relevant spending bills. If this funding is sufficient, all well and good. But if more money is needed to prolong or expand the anti-drug effort, then Congress has a responsibility to reevaluate the entire program. The purpose of my provision is to prevent the U.S. 
   government from slowly but steadily increasing its participation in the anti-narcotics effort in Colombia until it finds itself embroiled in, at best, a costly and open-ended anti-drug campaign throughout the Andean Ridge, or, at worst, a bloody civil war in Colombia. 
   A secondary goal of my provision is to limit the number of U.S. personnel engaged in the counter-narcotics offensive in Colombia to specific levels unless Congress approves higher levels of U.S. personnel. The provision, which I modified to address concerns raised by the Defense Department, imposes a ceiling of 500 U.S. military personnel and 300 U.S. civilian contractors working on Plan Colombia in Colombia unless Congress authorizes higher levels. 
   In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Defense Department indicated that it would not be opposed to troop caps. This is a prudent measure that Congress should endorse to ensure that U.S. involvement does not unwittingly spiral out of control in Colombia. 
   In an effort to ensure that my provision does not impede ongoing counter-narcotics operations in Colombia, I amended it to address concerns raised by the Administration regarding the availability of funds provided in the FY 2001 Defense Appropriations Bill, and the availability of relevant unobligated balances in other spending bills. My amendment protects ongoing programs without giving the Administration the green light to begin empire building in Colombia. 
   There are those, I am sure, who will say that my provision is too cumbersome, that we should simply handle this huge counter-narcotics offensive in the normal course of business. That, I believe, would be a dangerous course of action, one that would invite mission creep and deep entanglement in the internal affairs of Colombia. 
   U.S. assistance to Plan Colombia is not, and should not be, business as usual. If the Administration is sincere in its commitment to launch a major, coordinated, inter-agency offensive against the burgeoning drug industry in Colombia, then the Administration should welcome the spotlight that my provision will shine on its efforts. The Administration should welcome the extra safeguards that this language provides against unintended consequences. 
   Mr. President, winning the war against illegal drugs is vitally important to the future of our nation and to the future of our neighbors, but it is the responsibility of Congress to ensure that we are allocating U.S. taxpayers dollars in the most effective manner possible. Congress cannot make that determination without fully exploring the goals and potential ramifications of this effort to provide assistance to Colombia. My provision provides the minimum necessary safeguards to ensure congressional oversight of Plan Colombia. I commend the Senate for maintaining the integrity and the intent of this provision.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Sec. 576 of S. 2522 contains language regarding implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. I would like to ask the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee two questions to clarify their understanding of this provision. 
   The United States is currently engaged in climate change negotiations to ensure meaningful participation of developing countries and to ensure that greenhouse gas emissions reductions are achieved in the most cost-effective manner. Is my understanding correct that this provision is not intended to restrict the Administration from engaging in these international negotiations related to both the Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC), which was ratified by the Senate in 1992, and the Kyoto Protocol to that Convention? 
   As you also know, the Senate has clearly expressed its views regarding the Kyoto Protocol in S. Res. 98, adopted unanimously by the Senate on July 25, 1997. That resolution calls on the Administration to support an approach to climate change that protects the economic interests of the United States and seeks commitments from  developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Administration is aggressively engaging developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through international projects and activities emphasizing market-based mechanisms and environmental technology. It is my understanding that this provision is not intended to restrict international programs or activities to encourage commitments by developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Is my understanding correct?

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by Senator KENNEDY to expand the definitions of federally protected hate crimes. 
   I am concerned that this amendment would be challenged on Constitutional grounds and would not stand up to the scrutiny. I believe that categorizing hate crimes based on race, religion, or ethnicity as ``badges and incidents'' of slavery and relying on the Thirteenth Amendment is a tenuous argument. Furthermore, recent Supreme Court decisions finding that legislation federalizing what are traditionally State crimes exceeded Congress' powers under the Fourteenth Amendment, raise Constitutional concerns about the Kennedy amendment. The Kennedy amendment seeks to criminalize private conduct under the Fourteenth Amendment. In United States v. Morrison, the United States Supreme Court reaffirmed that legislation enacted by Congress under the Fourteenth Amendment may only criminalize State action, not individual action. I fear the Kennedy amendment will not survive a court challenge. 
   I further oppose the Kennedy amendment because I feel it did not go far enough in providing penalties for hate crimes. It did not include the death penalty for the newly created federal hate crimes.  
   I support Senator HATCH'S amendment that will allow for study and analysis of this important issue and provide additional resources for state and local entities in investigating and prosecuting existing hate crime statutes.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today, on June 20, 2000, the 35th star on the American flag--the star on the third row up from the bottom, second from the left--glows just a little bit brighter than the rest, at least for me and my fellow West Virginians. For today is the 137th anniversary of West Virginia's statehood in 1863. And like the star, I think that I, too, glow just a bit with pride, basking in the reflected beauty of my home State of West Virginia. 
   I am especially glad that West Virginia's birthday falls in June. While every month has its special joys, June is an exceptionally beautiful month in West Virginia, full of wildflowers and birdsong, of neat gardens laid out in orderly rows, of trees still fresh and richly green. June is a month of optimism, of outdoor weddings and picnics, of fresh corn still just a promise on the stalk, of children learning to fish along quiet streams, and of knobby-kneed colts and calves peeking shyly from between their mother's legs in meadows lush with grass. June is a month for celebrating. 
   We celebrate a fairly young State laid over a very old foundation. The history of West Virginia as a State has lasted for but an instant in the geologic scale of the steeply curving mountains that comprise most of the State's landmass. The soil and the rock of these mountains was first mounded up some 900 million years ago in the Precambrian era. Over time, this first Appalachian mountain chain eroded to form a seabed during the shifting movement of the continents. Then, about 500 million years ago, during the Ordovician period, the continents drifted back together, and these titanic forces pushed that sea floor up, creating the multiple parallel ridges that form the Appalachian mountains today. During the subsequent Triassic and Jurassic periods, known to every schoolchild as the age of dinosaurs, the continents settled into the configuration we know today. They are still settling. In the most recent period, 200 million years of wind and rain and snow and ice have eroded the Appalachian mountains to about half of their original height--a happenstance that I am sure West Virginia's early settlers appreciated as they hauled their belongings over rough tracks in wooden-wheeled carts. 
   West Virginia's topography has always been important. It shaped the kind of agriculture still seen today--smaller family farms carved out of sheltered hollows, small valleys, and steep hillsides. It shaped the kind of industry that developed, favoring resource extraction of fine timber, rich coal deposits, and chemicals over land-intensive, large-scale manufacturing. It shaped the politics of West Virginia's history, creating a divide between the independent mountaineers who settled these hills and the rest of what was then the Commonwealth of Virginia. And the mountains have always served as a kind of fortress wall around the hidden beauty of the State.  Before the advent of modern highways--which came late to the State of West Virginia, and which are still coming--it took a special determination to make one's way into our mountain fastnesses. 
   A child of war, West Virginia has the somewhat dubious honor of hosting the first major land battle of the Revolutionary War, at Point Pleasant, as well as the last skirmish of that war, at Fort Henry in Wheeling, in 1782. 
   Now, this information I came upon in a history of West Virginia, written by a West Virginian. 
   West Virginia gained her statehood during the Civil War, and her hills are dotted with battlefields from that conflict. Many historians, in fact, consider the clash at Philippi between Union Colonel Benjamin F. Kelly and his First Virginia Provisional Regiment and the forces under Confederate Colonel George A. Porterfield on the morning of June 3, 1861, to be the first land battle of the Civil War. So, from these violent beginnings, West Virginia has come a long way in just 137 years to host an international peace conference earlier this year in Shepherdstown. 
   West Virginia has come a long way, as well, from her early days as a resource-rich provider of building-block essentials like coal, and chemicals, and timber to a diversified economy of old staples and leading-edge, information-age high technology. And West Virginia has come a long way from being a quiet backwater region of narrow, winding, gravel and dirt roads that kept people isolated and insular to a State traversed by modern, safe, business-attracting highways. 
   I have seen these changes happen. I can remember the old dirt roads, the old gravel roads. I can remember when there were only 4 miles of divided four-lane highways in my State. And I can remember prior to that. When I was in the State legislature, in 1947, West Virginia only had 4 miles of divided four-lane highways. 
   Let me say that again. In 1947--53 years ago--when I was in the West Virginia Legislature, West Virginia only had 4 miles of divided four-lane highways. 
   It is much different now. West Virginia has at least between 900 and 1,000 miles of four-lane divided highways. Now there are some people who would like to see us go back to the time when we only had 4 miles of divided four-lane highways. In some ways I would like to go back to that time, too. But certainly I do not want to go back to that circumstance. 
   West Virginia has blossomed as she has matured, reaching out gracefully to the future while preserving and honoring the rich history of her past. 
   As a State, West Virginia is aging, and her population is aging, as well. West Virginia boasts the oldest median age in the Nation. I like to think that this statistic, in part, proves that West Virginia is as attractive a place in which to retire as are some of the more steamy States in the Nation. Of course, West Virginia's bracing climate, with its breathtaking seasonal changes, may be responsible for keeping West Virginia's elders active long after retirement. There is always a garden to plant, or leaves to rake, or simply beautiful walks to take, activities that keep the joints--joints of the arms and legs--agile and the mind busy. Age, and the wisdom that can only be accumulated with experience, is respected in the Mountaineer state. Just two weeks ago, the State hosted the first-ever United Nations International Conference on Rural Aging, taking its place at the forefront of efforts to keep the 60 percent of seniors around the world who live in rural areas healthy, active, and independent. 
   Yet despite all the changes, one thing has remained constant in West Virginia; namely, the down to earth, faith-in-God values of her people. We have no hesitancy in using that word and not using it in vain. There is a tendency these days to kind of put the lid on using the word ``God.'' No, don't use his name; don't use God's name. I am against using his name in vain. I can't say that I have not done that in my time, but I am very much opposed to that. But I am not opposed to using God's name in schools and anywhere else. I am for that. I will have no hesitancy to do it myself, no hesitancy whatsoever. 
   West Virginians are taught to honor their mother and father and to do what is right, even if that is not the easiest path. In West Virginia, we try to live by the Golden Rule, and always remember to give thanks to the Creator for the many blessings he has bestowed upon us. We ought to go back and read the Mayflower Compact and see how those men and women felt about God. In a time when society is focused on speed and instant gratification, West Virginians know the value of taking time to enjoy the beauty around them. Those values, which have survived for 137 years, I expect will be around for another 137, at least. 
   So, at age 137, the 137th birthday, West Virginia is a youngster on the geologic time scale and just entering her middle age on the political scale. In terms of her population's age, well, let us be polite and say only that she is ``of a certain age,'' still at least a few steps way from becoming, a grand dame. All that I will say is, she certainly is grand! 
 West Virginia, how I love you! Every streamlet, shrub and stone, Even the clouds that flit above you Always seem to be my own. 
 Your steep hillsides clad in grandeur, Always rugged, bold and free, Sing with ever swelling chorus: Montani, Semper, Liberi! 
 Always free! The little streamlets, As they glide and race along, Join their music to the anthem And the zephyrs swell the song. 
 Always free! The mountain torrent In its haste to reach the sea, Shouts its challenge to the hillsides And the echo answers ``FREE!'' 
 Always free! Repeat the river In a deeper, fuller tone And the West wind in the treetops Adds a chorus all its own. 
 Always Free! The crashing thunder Madly flung from hill to hill, In a wild reverberation Adds a mighty, ringing thrill. 
 Always free! The Bob White whistles And the whippoorwill replies, Always free! The robin twitters As the sunset gilds the skies. 
 Perched upon the tallest timber, Far above the sheltered lea, There the eagle screams defiance To a hostile world: ``I'm free!'' 
 And two million happy people, Hearts attuned in holy glee, Add the hallelujah chorus: ``Mountaineers are always free!''

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am going to increasingly call attention to the disorder that prevails in this Senate. 
   As I sat here and listened to this crowd in the well, I wondered to myself: Can you imagine Norris Cotton being in that well? Can you imagine George Aiken being in the well at that time? Can you imagine Senator Dick Russell being in the well? Can you imagine Lister Hill being there? 
   I don't know what the people who visit as our guests in the galleries think of this institution. It resembles the floor of a stock exchange. I can understand that once in a while people have to go in the well and ask a question. But we are supposed to vote from our seats. I do not know how many Senators know that, but there is a regulation providing that Senators shall vote from their seats. I urge the leadership on both sides to insist that that be done. I always try to vote from my seat. It doesn't present any problem for me, voting from my seat. I realize that some Senators don't get an opportunity to talk to one another until they come to the rollcalls, but we have a vast area outside the Chamber or in the Cloakrooms where they can do that. 
   So I am going to urge the joint leadership to insist that Senators vote from their desks. If Senators will look on page 158 of the Senate Manual under ``Senate regulations'', they will find this regulation. May I ask the Chair to read that regulation to the Senate.

   I don't say this with any animus, but I am concerned about how the Senate appears to visitors during roll call votes. Perhaps other Senators may not be quite so concerned, but I am because it seems to be getting worse.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today is a very special anniversary. One will not find it noted on most calendars. Although it lacks the familiarity of the anniversary of the writing of the Constitution, for example, it is a day well worth remembering. The 15th day of this month deserves our attention for one very fundamental reason which is quite important to this Republic and to those of us in this Chamber. It marks the birth of the idea that ours is a government of laws and not of men, and that no man, no man is above the law. 
   Seven hundred and eighty-five years ago, on June 15, 1215, English barons met on the plains of Runnymede, on the Thames River near Windsor Castle, to present a list of demands to their king. King John had recently engaged in a series of costly and disastrous military adventures against France. These operations had drained the royal treasury and forced King John to receive the barons' list of demands. These demands--known as the Articles of the Barons--were intended as a restatement of ancient baronial liberties, as a limitation on the king's power to raise funds, and as a reassertion of the principle of due process under law, at that time referred to in these words, ``law of the land.'' Under great pressure, King John accepted the barons' demands on June 15 and set his royal seal to their set of stipulations. Four days later, the king and barons agreed on a formal version of that document. It is that version that we know today as Magna Carta. Thirteen copies were made and distributed to every English county to be read to all freemen. Four of those copies survive today. 
   Several of this ancient document's sixty-three clauses are of towering importance to our system of government. The thirty-ninth clause, evident in the U.S. Constitution's Fifth and Fourteenth amendments, underscores the vital importance of the rule of law and due process of law. It reads ``No freeman shall be captured or imprisoned ..... except by lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land.'' 
   Beginning with Henry III, the nine-year-old who succeeded King John in 1216, English kings reaffirmed Magna Carta many times, and in 1297 under Edward I it became a fundamental part of English law in the confirmation of the charters. (An original of the 1297 edition is on indefinite loan from the Perot Foundation and is displayed in the rotunda of the National Archives.) In 1368, that would have been under the reign of Edward III, a statute of Edward III established the supremacy of Magna Carta by requiring that it ``be holden and kept in all Points; and if there be any Statute made to the contrary, it shall be holden for none.'' 
   In the early 1600s, the jurist and parliamentary leader Sir Edward Coke interpreted Magna Carta as an instrument of human liberty, and in doing so, made it a weapon in the parliamentary struggle against the gathering absolutism of the Stuart monarchy. As he proclaimed to Parliament in 1628, ``Magna Carta will have no sovereign.'' Unless Englishmen insist on their rights, another observed, ``then farewell Parliaments and farewell England.'' 
   By the end of that century, through the course of civil war and the Glorious Revolution, the rights of self-government, first acknowledged in 1215, became firmly secured. 
   As settlers began their migration to England's colonies throughout the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, they took with them an understanding of their laws and liberties as Englishmen. Magna Carta inspired William Penn as he shaped Pennsylvania's charter of government. Members of the colonial Stamp Act Congress in 1765 interpreted Magna Carta to secure the right to jury trials. 
   After the colonies declared their independence of Great Britain, many of their new state constitutions carried bills of rights derived from the 1215 charter, Magna Carta. As University of Virginia law professor A.E. Dick Howard notes in his classic study of the subject, by the twentieth century, Magna Carta had become ``irrevocably embedded into the fabric of American constitutionalism, both 
   by contributing specific concepts such as due process of law and by being the ultimate symbol of constitutional government under a rule of law.'' 
   In 1975, the British Parliament offered Congress and the American people a most generous gift. To celebrate two hundred years of American independence from Great Britain, Parliament offered to loan one of Magna Carta's four surviving copies to the United States Congress for a year. The document they selected is known as the Wymes copy and is regularly displayed in the British Library. Parliament also made a permanent gift of a magnificent display case bearing a gold replica of Magna Carta. 
   A delegation of Senators and Representatives traveled to London in May 1976 to receive that document at a colorful and thronged ceremony in Westminster Hall. On June 3, 1976, a distinguished delegation of parliamentary officials joined their American counterparts for a gala ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda. The display case containing Magna Carta was placed near the Rotunda's center, where, over the following year, more than five million visitors had the rare opportunity to view this fundamental charter at close range. 
   At a June 13, 1977, ceremony concluding the exhibit, I offered brief remarks in my capacity as Senate Majority Leader. I noted that nothing during the previous bicentennial year had meant more to the nation than this gift. I recalled the Lord Chancellor's diplomatic interpretation, during the 1976 ceremony, of the reasons for the bicentennial celebrations. This is what he said:  
   What happened two hundred years ago, we learned, was not a victory by the American colonies over Britain but rather a joint victory for freedom by the English-speaking world.  
   Today, the magnificent display case remains in the Capitol Rotunda as a reminder of our two nations' joint political heritage. I encourage my colleagues to visit this case in the rotunda and examine its panel with raised gold text duplicating that of Magna Carta. What better way could we choose to observe this very special anniversary day?

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank our very distinguished Democratic whip, Mr. REID, for his accommodation. I thank the distinguished manager of the bill, Mr. SHELBY, for his characteristic kindness and consideration. 
   Mr. President, this Sunday, June 18, is Father's Day. The Bible tells us to ``honor thy father and thy mother.'' I would like to take just a few minutes to pay tribute to fathers and to call particular attention to this coming Sunday, that day of special significance. 
   An old English proverb tells us that ``one father is more than 100 schoolmasters.'' Fatherhood is the most compelling, the most profound responsibility in a man's life. 
   For those of us who are fathers, there is nothing that we can do here in this Chamber that is more important than our commitment to our children. And, of course, with the greatest responsibilities, come the greatest joys and the greatest challenges. For those of us who are blessed with a long life, we learn that existence is an intricate mosaic of tranquility and difficulty. Struggles, along with blessings, are an inevitable, and instructive, part of life. A caring father prepares us for this reality. He teaches us that, in human nature, there is no perfection, there is simply the obligation to do one's best. 
   My foster father, Titus Dalton Byrd, my aunt's husband, gave me my name and to a great extent the best aspects--and there are a few, I suppose--of my character. His was not an easy life. He struggled to support his wife and his little foster son during the depths of the Great Depression. This Nation is today blessed with the greatest economy the world has ever known. But, for those of us who remember the terrible poverty that gripped this Nation during the 1930's, prosperity, at one time in our lives, seemed a very, very long time in coming. It seemed far, far away. 
   The test of character, the real test of character in a nation is how that nation responds to adversity, and the same with regard to a person, how that person responds to adversity, not only in his own life but in the lives of others. 
   The Roman philosopher Seneca said that ``fire is the test of gold; adversity, of strong men.'' 
   In this respect, Titus Dalton Byrd was a great teacher. He easily could have been a bitter man, a despairing man. He could have raged at his lot in life. He could have forsaken his family. He could have forsaken his faith. 
   I remember as clear as if it were yesterday watching for that man, that tall black-haired man with a red mustache coming down the railroad tracks. I recall watching for him as I looked far up the tracks that led ultimately to the mine, the East Five Mine in Stotesbury where he worked. I would see him coming from afar, and I would run to meet him. 
   As I neared him, he would always set his dinner bucket down on a cross tie. He would lift off the top of that dinner bucket, and as I came to him, he would reach in and he would bring out a cake, a little 5-cent cake that had been bought at the coal company store. 
   He would reach down into that dinner bucket. He would pull out that cake and give it to me, after he had worked all day, from early morning to quitting time. And in the early days, quitting time was when the coal miner loaded the coal, loaded the slate, the rock, and cleaned up his ``place'' for the next day. 
   He had gone through those hours with the timbers to the right and the timbers to the left, cracking under the weight of millions of tons of earth overhead. He had sweated. He had worked on his knees, many times working in water holes because the roof of the mine was perhaps only 4 feet or 3 feet above the ground. He toiled there with a shovel, with a pick, and his calloused hands showed the result of that daily hard toil. Of course, he wore gloves and he wore kneepads so that he could make his way on the ground, on his knees, lifting the coal by the shovelful and dumping it over into the mine car. There he worked in the darkness except for a carbide lamp. It was a very hazardous and dangerous job. But when he had his lunch, he ate the rest of the food but always saved the cake. 
   When I ran to meet him, he would set down the dinner pail and lift off the cover and reach in and get that cake and give it to me. He always saved the cake for me. 
   He was an unassuming man. Unlike me, he never said very much. He took the hard licks as they came. I never heard him use God's name in vain in all the years I lived with him. Never. He never complained. When he sat down to eat at the table, he never complained at the humble fare. I never heard him complain. He was as honest as the day was long. When he died, he did not owe any man a penny. He always represented a triumph of the human spirit to me. He honored his responsibilities. He did his duty. 
   He could not be characterized as a literate man. He never read Emerson's essays or Milton's ``Paradise Lost'' or Bocaccio's ``Decameron,'' or the ``History of Rome.'' He could hardly read at all. I suppose the only book he ever read was the Bible. His formal education was in the school of hard knocks, but he was a wise man. He knew right from wrong. 
   That sounds simple, even quaint, in these sophisticated times, but it surely is not. Cicero said, ``The function of wisdom is to discriminate between good and evil.'' To genuinely know right from wrong and to honor that as the guiding force in one's life--that is not always simple. That is not always easy. Brilliant theologians of every faith on Earth will tell you that such moral discernment is a central spiritual challenge of a human life. But my dad knew right from wrong. He read his Bible, the King James' version of the Bible. 
   When the burdens of my dad's life were almost too heavy to bear during the desperate poverty of the Great Depression, his faith never wavered that the Creator would give him the strength he needed. Abraham Lincoln, as he contended with the overwhelming agonies of a nation torn apart by a great civil war, said of the Bible:  
   This great Book ..... is the best gift God has given to man.  
   Mr. President, this is a lesson that great men, whether mighty or humble, have learned, and it is the lesson my dad taught me. 
   We live now in what has been termed the age of information. But, as we salute our fathers on this coming Sunday, this is an opportune time to again sound a note of caution for our children. Information is not the same as wisdom. Our society, including our children and our grandchildren, and our great grandchildren, is bombarded with information and entertainment, such as it is, useless, tasteless, and bewildering, much of which is geared to our basest instincts and our tawdriest impulses. It is a parade of the lowest common denominator all too often. This is the more complicated world with which parents today must contend. Parents need to instill wisdom in their children, a moral sense that will enable their children to navigate through a volatile sea of uplifting and distressing images. 
   My dad, like most rural people, who was not used to much, never had much, found solace and understanding in nature. He understood the generous and bountiful delights of nature. The flowers of spring, this blessed season which officially gives way to summer on June 21, call us back to the beauty and sweetness of the world, and perhaps hint at what is best within ourselves as well. Spring is the season of rebirth, the season of replenishment. I defy any cluttered, tumultuous, cacophonous television program to compete with the simple, quiet drama of the forsythias, the dogwoods, the roses, and the azaleas, to compete with a single miraculous bud. 
   James Russell Lowell wrote:  
   And what is so rare as a day in June? 
   Then, if ever, come perfect days; 
   Then Heaven tries earth if it be in tune, 
   And over it softly her warm ear lays: 
   Whether we look, or whether we listen; 
   We hear life murmur, or see it glisten.  
   As I have said, my dad was not himself a formally educated man. But, he understood and he appreciated nature, and he knew the tremendous value of an education. 
   That is why he wanted me to go on to school. He did not want me to be a coal miner. He did not want me to earn my living in that way. He encouraged, indeed, he demanded that I study hard. He looked at that report card. He looked at that category denominated ``deportment.'' And he always said: If you get a whipping at school, I'll give you a whipping when you get home. And I knew that that one would be the worst of the two. But he loved me. I knew he loved me. That is why he threatened to whip me; it was because he loved me. 
   He encouraged me to study hard and to develop my mind. He wanted something better for me. He knew that education was the key that I would need to unlock the potential in my own life. 
   So, Titus Dalton Byrd was a model for me not only of the virtuous individual life, but of married life as well. He and my mom, my Aunt Vlurma, were married for 53 years. I do not recall ever witnessing either of them raise a voice in anger against the other. And I heard them say from time to time: We have made it a pledge that both of us would not be angry at the same time. 
   I have always counted myself as truly fortunate--truly fortunate--even though my life's ladder had the bottom rungs taken away. You ought to see where I lived, Mr. President. You ought some time to go with me down Mercer County and see where I lived--3 miles up the hollow, with no electricity, with no running water, the nearest hospital 15, 20 miles away, the nearest doctor the same. That was back in the days of the 2-cent stamp, the penny postcard. Some things were better; some things were not. But I have always counted myself as truly fortunate in having such exemplary role models. 
   A lot of people say today there are no role models anymore. Well, I had two role models in the good old man and woman who reared me. 
   They set the standard to which I have not always succeeded but I have always aspired. And, on May 29, my beloved wife Erma and I celebrated our 63rd wedding anniversary. 
   We both came from families, from mothers and fathers, who tried to bring us up right. And they inculcated into us a dedication to one's oath. 
   Like, I suspect, many fathers whose jobs consume so much of their time and energy, I regret the times away from my daughters when they were children. I am grateful for the capable and loving efforts of Erma who has shouldered so much of the responsibilities at my home. To the extent, limited though it may be, that I have been a good father, I am humbly indebted to Erma's having been such a wonderful mother. Our journey as a family has been a more tranquil one thanks to her patience, her understanding, and her strength. 
   Of course, the roles of fathers--and mothers--in some ways have changed a great deal over the course of my lifetime. Parents today are confronted with far more choices at home and work than my wife and I ever encountered when we began our family. But, one thing has not changed. One thing has, in my opinion, remained constant. Parenthood is, ideally, a partnership, a collaboration. It is a vitally important, lifelong responsibility, and best experienced, whenever possible, in the shared, balanced efforts of both parents. 
   No mortal soul is perfect or without fault. That is the reality of being human. We are all prey to losing our way at difficult times in our lives. But, a good father will provide his child with a map, a path to follow. The hallmark of that path, throughout life, is conscience. It is that inner moral compass that has been so essential to the greatness of our Nation, and that is, I fear, so buffeted now by an aimless, hedonistic popular culture. 
   The ancient truths of our fathers are perhaps more obscure in this noisy, materialistic society, but they are still there--still there--gleaming and bright. John Adams, one of the great Founding Fathers of this Nation, said:  
   All sober inquiries after truth, ancient and modern, divines, moralists and philosophers, have agreed that the happiness of mankind, as well as the real dignity of human nature, consists in virtue.  
   The material things, with all their appeal and their comfort, are, in the end, fleeting. They are all transient. I remember not so much the tangible things--other than a piece of cake perhaps--that my dad gave me, as the values that he taught me. It is the treasured, if fleeting, moments together, the lessons learned, that 
   endure. I can say now, from the perspective of a long and full and eventful life, that that is what matters. That is the greatest gift we can receive as children, and that is the greatest gift that we can bequest as parents. 
   A caring father is a lifelong comfort. I remember the stoic and kindly face of Titus Dalton Byrd. He encouraged me, he protected me, and his memory still guides me. 
   Mr. President, I have met with Kings in my lifetime, with Shahs, with Princes, with Presidents, with Princesses, with Queens, with Senators, with Governors, but I am here to say today that the greatest man that I ever knew in my long life, the really great man that I really knew in my long life, was my dad, Titus Dalton Byrd. 
   He taught me, in word and in deed, to work hard, to do my absolute best. 
   I close with this bit of verse: 
   That Dad of Mine 
   He's slowing down, as some folks say 
   With the burden of years from day to day; 
   His brow bears many a furrowed line; 
   He's growing old--that dad of mine.  
   His shoulders droop, and his step is slow; 
   And his hair is white, as white as snow; 
   But his kind eyes sparkle with a friendly light; 
   His smile is warm, and his heart is right.  
   He's old? Oh, yes. But only in years, 
   For his spirit soars as the sunset nears. 
   And blest I've been, and wealth I've had, 
   In knowing a man like my old dad.  
   And proud I am to stand by him, 
   As he stood by me when the way was dim; 
   I've found him worthy and just as fine, 
   A prince of men--that dad of mine.  
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Fiscal Year 2001 Transportation Appropriations bill, and I compliment the Chairman of the Subcommittee, Senator SHELBY, and the Ranking Member, Senator LAUTENBERG, for the outstanding job that they have done on this measure. 
   Their recommendations, which were approved by a unanimous vote of the Appropriations Committee, are the best that could be done within the very tight 302(b) allocation that was provided to the Subcommittee. I am hopeful that we will be able to provide increased funding for the Transportation Subcommittee, as the bill proceeds through the Senate and its conference with the House. As is usual for the Transportation Subcommittee, the programs and activities contained in this bill are funded in as fair and balanced a way as one could expect. I am proud of the work of the managers of this bill. Very importantly, the bill continues to fully fund the highway spending levels set forth in the Transportation Equity Act for the Twenty-First Century, TEA-21. As members will recall, when that landmark legislation was debated and enacted two years ago, I joined with Senator GRAMM of Texas as well as Senators WARNER and BAUCUS, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the Environment and Public Works Committee, to provide some $26 billion in additional highway spending over the six-year life of that measure. In so doing, we put the ``trust'' back into the Highway Trust Fund. We assured the American people that the full amount of the gasoline taxes that they pay at the gas pump, and which go into the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund, will be spent on construction and rehabilitation of our Nation's highway and transit systems. Unfortunately, for the second year in a row, the Administration's budget proposed that a large portion of these Highway Trust Funds be used for non-highway purposes. Fortunately, the managers of this bill, Senators SHELBY and LAUTENBERG, found a way to reject the Administration's proposal and to continue, in full, the commitments made to the American people; namely, that all of the gasoline taxes that they pay will be fully spent, each year, for the purposes for which those taxes were collected. I am grateful to the managers of the bill for having the wisdom and the courage to reject the Administration's ill-conceived proposal for a second year in a row. I hope the Administration will get the message that this Congress is not interested in going back on the commitments it made and that the President signed into law in TEA-21, to keep the ``trust'' in the Highway Trust Fund. 
   Mr. President, I note that this will mark the last occasion upon which Senator LAUTENBERG will serve as the Ranking Member of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee. During his tenure as Chairman and Ranking Member of this Subcommittee, Senator LAUTENBERG has always been very cooperative with me in my role as Chairman and Ranking Member of the Appropriations Committee. He was no less cooperative when I served as Majority and Minority Leader of the Senate. He has demonstrated the courage to take a stand for what he believes in, throughout his Senate career, even when the votes were not there. He has performed a tremendous service to his State, as well as to his Country on many critical issues. He has worked tirelessly on a broad range of transportation issues throughout his service on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation. These accomplishments range from improvements in Amtrak service, to ensuring that there are sufficient resources for the FAA, Coast Guard, mass transit and highway safety programs. When it comes to transportation issues, Senator LAUTENBERG has always been in the forefront. He has always fought valiantly to protect the lives of the American people. He was the author of the smoking ban on airplanes. He was the author of the Minimum Drinking Age Act. His tireless battle against drunk-driving, which began with that Act, has now brought us to this appropriations bill, which includes a provision establishing a national intoxication threshold of point-zero-eight (.08) blood alcohol content. The Senate will miss FRANK LAUTENBERG. We will remember him with great fondness. 
   The one disservice, however, that he performed for his Nation, and for the Senate, and for the Appropriations Committee, was his decision not to run again. I am sorry that he made that decision. I talked with him about the matter several times. I told him that it was simply not good for the Country. I don't say that because he is a Democrat--I say that because this man is a Senate man. This man has rendered great service. I greatly regret his decision--and I told him so, and I urged him to rethink it, because he renders the kind of service that our Country needs. I salute him for his Senate service. And, I say again, we are going to miss this man--FRANK LAUTENBERG. 
   Mr. President, I urge all Members to support the Fiscal Year 2001 Transportation Appropriations Bill now before the Senate.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on Friday, June 9, I noted with particular interest the headline in The Washington Post which read, ``Bush Aims at `Discord' in Capital.'' Not surprisingly, candidate Bush's solution to too much partisanship in Washington is to increase the power of the Presidency. 
   We have heard that before. We have heard it from the current President, and we have heard it from previous Presidents. But now we hear it again. Imagine that. The solution to too much partisanship in Washington is to increase the power of the President. 
   Now imagine that! Among the ``power grabs'' the candidate advocates are biennial budgeting, a congressional budget resolution which would have to be signed by the President--get that--a version of the line-item veto--how preposterous--and a commission to recommend ``pork-barrel projects for elimination.'' What a joke. 
   While I readily agree with candidate Bush that there is too much partisanship in Washington, and have said so repeatedly for years, the solutions candidate Bush proposes will do absolutely nothing to eliminate partisanship. In the highly unlikely event that any of these proposals will ever be enacted, their most likely impact would be to hand the next President a club with which to beat into submission members of Congress who might not be leaning the President's way on key issues of importance to him. 
   None of these reported Bush solutions to disharmony in Washington are new, nor are they ``news.'' Every President in recent history has tried to wrest more power from the people's duly elected representatives and transfer it to the executive branch. The net effect of all such transfers would be that unelected executive-branch bureaucrats, and, the President, who is not directly elected by the people either, would enjoy an increased advantage in forcing their agenda on this Nation. 
   Make no mistake about it. The carefully crafted constitutional checks and balances between the branches of Government can slowly be subverted over time by just such proposals as these, which candidate Bush has made. While I agree that the climate in Washington these days is less than inspiring, the cure must never be to advocate a weakening of the constitutional checks and balances under the false colors of constructive reform. 
   Take, for instance, Mr. Bush's proposal to have a commission recommend certain pork-barrel projects for elimination. This is an idea which, conceptually, goes straight at the heart of representative democracy and at its most important tool, the power of the purse. It is a proposal which exposes an absolute ignorance and disregard of the constitutional grant of spending power to the representatives--and I am one of them--of the 50 States. Moreover, when examined closely, the arrogance of such an approach is close to appalling. 
   To suggest that an appointed commission could somehow understand the needs of the 50 States in terms of public works better than the men and women who are sent here to represent those States, defies logic and denigrates the people's judgment in the choice of their own Members of Congress. Imagine a commission that would be set up to make judgments about appropriations concerning infrastructure, about bridges, roads, highways, canals, harbors, rivers in this country. That is why the people sent us here; that is our responsibility. No member of a commission can possibly understand the needs of the State I represent--I defy anyone to contend otherwise--and have been proud to represent for 54 years, better than I, and others in the West Virginia delegation. No commission can tell me or tell the people of West Virginia what they need by way of infrastructure, so-called ``pork barrel'' projects. The same can be said about the Members from other States. I defy anyone to claim that sort of wisdom to the satisfaction of myself or the citizens of my State. Such a claim would be sheer and utter nonsense! 
   I realize that the term ``pork-barrel'' has become symbolic in modern parlance of everything that is wrong with Government. But, in fact, one man's ``pork-barrel'' project is another man's essential road, another constituency's essential road or bridge or dam. What is totally forgotten is that many of these so-called ``pork barrel'' projects are the sort of infrastructure improvements which, State by State, combine to help to make this country the economic power house that it has become. Now, Webster debated with Hayne in 1830. That has all been plowed over by Webster at that time. 
   It is easy to oppose infrastructure projects in another Member's state. I wouldn't do it unless there was outright fraud involved. It is easy to claim that if a project does not benefit me or my State, then it must be wasteful. Of course, when it comes down to it, they don't benefit me personally. They benefit the people I represent. But, the Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle generally grant each other the expertise to know what is essential for their own State's well-being. I believe that I would be a poor judge, indeed, of what is good for California or New Mexico or Arizona, and so I generally rely on the Members of those States when it comes to projects which they deem important. 
   I also assume that the elected representatives of those states have the wisdom and integrity not to advocate foolish or wasteful endeavors. Federal dollars are and have been scarce for years. Congressional spending is watched closely by representatives of the media and by the voters who send us here. What is not watched so closely by the media or the voters who send us here or the voters who indirectly send the topmost occupant of the White House to his position is executive branch spending. Although the voters may be only dimly aware of waste and duplication vigorously advocated and defended each year by the executive  branch, I can assure everyone within the sound of my voice and everyone watching through the electronic eye that it exists in the executive branch. 
   Talk about pork barrel; take a look at the executive branch! A more useful commission might be one that is charged to look at executive branch excesses and report yearly to the Congress. 
   How about that? Let the candidates for the Presidency and Vice Presidency take that on. Let both candidates, Mr. Bush and Mr. GORE, take that on. Look at the executive branch, see what the excesses are there, weed out the pork barrel. 
   As for any attempt to negate the decisions of the people's duly elected representatives through any form of line-item veto process, I assure the new President--and I don't know who will be the new President just yet, but I can assure the new President, whether he be a Republican or a Democrat, whether he be Mr. Bush or Mr. GORE--it doesn't make any difference to me in this respect--whichever party he may represent, that that proposal concerning a line-item veto will encounter a solid stonewall from this Senate, as it has always encountered such a wall. 
   We slew that dragon once in the courts, didn't we? Yes, we slew that dragon in the courts. Thank God for the Supreme Court of the United States, certainly in that incidence. We slew that dragon once in the courts, and it will raise its ugly head again only with very great difficulty. Any proposal which seeks to bury a dagger in the heart of the most powerful check which the Constitution provides on an overreaching President will encounter serious opposition right here on this floor, and right here at this desk. Amen! May God continue to give me the voice with which to speak and the legs on which to stand to fight this dragon, wherever it may appear. 
   The power over the purse--a power derived through centuries of struggle and bloodshed--a power that protects the people of this Nation from the whims of a fool or knave in the White House--has been bequeathed to the people's branch in our national charter. It is not there through any accident. It is there through no luck of the draw. It is there because the framers understood the lessons of history and had the wisdom to know that a King or a President must be made controllable by the people in this most fundamental, this most basic way. 
   By its very nature, any proposal which hands to the President an easy means by which to threaten a Member with the cancellation or redirection of moneys for that Member's State, after those moneys have been appropriated in law by the Congress, gives the President undue and unwise leverage over Members of Congress in a way that completely alters the nature of the separation of powers. 
   Ask any Governor or former Governor who has had the tool of a line-item veto at his disposal what he found to be its principal value. You will probably get an answer that indicates that the major usefulness of the line-item veto is a means to bully certain uncooperative members of the State legislature. I urge candidate Bush and I urge candidate GORE and all of their advisers to read afresh article I of the U.S. Constitution. Read it again. Pay particular attention to it. The intent of the framers is crystal clear. 
   As for biennial budgeting, at the moment, I am not so sure about that. With respect to biennial appropriations, however, I am very sure. I would be very opposed to that. I fear that with biennial budgeting there may be some unintended consequences. With respect to biennial appropriations, I still fear that the consequences of such a change might ultimately mean massive supplemental appropriations bills to cover contingencies which no human mind can predict, such as earthquakes, floods, droughts, wars, or recessions. 
   While biennial appropriations are always touted for their supposed natural byproduct--more oversight--I believe that, in the real world, the kind of massive supplemental appropriations bills which will likely occur as a result of any such biennial appropriations, if we ever reach that point, will receive very little in the way of thorough oversight. 
   In truth, most of our serious budget problems derive not from yearly appropriations, but from the ever-growing mandatory spending and entitlement programs. Dealing with politically difficult entitlement and mandatory spending reform demands the kind of study, analysis, consensus, leadership, and courage that no process tinkering can replace. One thing I have learned after 48 years in this town is that when hard decisions press down on politicians, process reform often becomes the solution of choice. 
   I also noted in the same Post article--and I must admit with some amusement--that while candidate Bush decries polling, he appears to have been paying at least some modicum of attention to the polls, else how would he know that ``Americans look upon the spectacle in Washington and they do not like what they see''? I am quoting from the reported story. Perhaps he has found some direct way to channel the viewpoints of the people, but I rather think he has been doing a little poll watching of his own. 
   The trouble with election year poll watching is that it makes us politicians think we have to instantly respond, either to get a headline or get a vote. As one might expect, these quickie candidate responses are often neither very responsive nor very wise. 
   No, the climate in Washington today cannot be improved by any such commission, as has been recommended, or any budget process change, or any power grab by the executive branch. The problems here have to do in part with this being an election year and in part with more fundamental matters. If we in this body could just begin to do away with the simplicity of labeling each other as devils, and each other's proposals as ruinous to the Republic and, instead, worked to promote a freer, less rancorous exchange of debate and discussion on this floor, I believe that much of the pointless partisanship might begin to dissipate. 
   The partisanship we all complain about is born, at least partially, from the frustration of not being permitted to adequately and openly debate issues and ideas important to our constituencies and to the Nation. 
   I believe that once we begin to do what our people sent us here to do, which is grapple with the nation's challenges, exchange views, and learn and profit from those exchanges, we will see a return of most of the lost public confidence which may have been reflected in somebody's polls. Legislating in a Republic--and it is a republic, not a democracy. I want to say that again. We pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic--not to the democracy. 
   Well, legislating in a republic can never be a totally neat, efficient, and tidy endeavor. In a nation as large and diverse as our own, which bears heavy responsibilities both domestically and internationally, the way to wisdom usually lies in the often tedious, rarely orderly, free flow of informed debate. Consensus is what we need to aim for, and consensus is best built by an airing of views. The Framers knew this and gave the Congress the power to legislate, tax and appropriate because of that fundamental understanding. But, absolutely basic to that kind of informed discussion and debate is respect among those of us charged with conducting it, for the motives, experience, expertise, and opinions of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Regrettably no shop-worn set of budget process changes can mandate that. And the American people should view with an especially jaundiced eye any finger wagging presidential candidate with an agenda all his own who wants to transfer power to himself in order to quiet congressional ``discord.'' 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the June 9, 2000 Washington Post article.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today is the 223rd anniversary of the adoption, by the Continental Congress meeting in Philadelphia, of a resolution establishing a new symbol for the new nation that was then in its birth throes. The resolution, passed on June 14, 1777, was a model of simplicity, specifying only ``that the flag be 13 stripes alternate red and white; that the union be 13 stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.'' Although the flag reputedly stitched by Betsy Ross arranged the stars in a full circle, other versions of this first flag placed the stars in a half circle or in rows, as the resolution did not state how the new constellation was to be configured. 
   This first flag, like the Constitution to follow it in 1787, was not entirely new, but rather predicated on flags that had come before it. An English flag, known as the Red Ensign, flew over the thirteen colonies from 1707 until the Revolution. The body of this flag was red, with a Union Jack design in the upper left corner composed of the combined red-on-white Cross of St. George, patron of England, and the white-on-blue diagonal cross of St. Andrew, patron of Scotland. The Red Ensign was the merchant flag of England, reinforcing for the colonists and their status as an unequal and lesser partner in their relationship with Mother England. 
   The Grand Union flag that first succeeded the Red Ensign was raised on January 1, 1776, approximately a year after the American Revolution had begun, over George Washington's headquarters in the outskirts of Boston. The Grand Union flag retained the Union Jack in the upper left corner, but the solid red body of the English trade flag was now broken by six white stripes. However, the stripes alone did not represent enough of a separation from England, and, a year later, the patron saints of England and Scotland were removed from the flag, to be replaced by the ``new constellation,'' more representative of the new nation which was then decisively vying for freedom. 
   In the ensuing years, stars and stripes were added to the flag, reflecting the growth of the young nation. The flag flying over Fort McHenry during the naval bombardment of September 13 and 14, 1814, that inspired Francis Scott Key to compose the immortal words that became our national anthem, contained fifteen stars and fifteen stripes. By 1818, the number of stars had climbed to twenty, while the number of stripes had shrunk back to the more manageable thirteen. On April 4, 1818, Congress adopted another resolution to specify that the number of stripes on the flag would forever remain at thirteen, representing the original thirteen colonies, while a star would be added to the flag for each new state to join the union. 
   Henry Ward Beecher once said:  
   A thoughtful mind, when it sees a Nation's flag, sees not the flag only, but the Nation itself; and whatever may be its symbols, its insignia, he reads chiefly in the flag the Government, the principles, the truths, the history which belongs to the Nation that sets if forth.  
   Certainly, knowing the history and evolution of the American flag from the Red Ensign, through the Grand Union flag, to the Stars and Stripes,  one can see clearly into the early history of our nation. The symbolism of the flag also echoes the principles of our government, with each state represented by its own star in the constellation, equal to all the other stars, and each one a vital part of the constellation as a whole. 
   I think that it is also reflective of our nation of free people that the idea for Flag Day arose, not from a Governmental decree, but from the people. The idea of an annual day to celebrate the Flag is believed to have originated in 1885, when B.J. Cigrand, a school teacher from Fredonia, WI, arranged for pupils of Fredonia's Public School District 6 to celebrate June 14 as ``Flag Birthday.'' Over the following years, Mr. Cigrand advocated the observance of June 14 as ``Flag Birthday'' or ``Flag Day'' in magazine and newspaper articles, as well as public addresses. 
   In 1889, George Balach, a kindergarten teacher in New York City, planned Flag Day ceremonies for the children in his school. His idea of observing Flag Day was subsequently adopted by the State Board of Education of New York. In 1891, the Betsy Ross House in Philadelphia held a Flag Day celebration, and in 1892, the New York Society of the Sons of the Revolution held similar festivities. 
   The Sons of the Revolution in Philadelphia, and the Pennsylvania Society of Colonial Dames of America, further encouraged the widespread adoption of Flag Day, and on June 14, 1893, in Independence Square in Philadelphia, Flag Day exercises were conducted for Philadelphia public school children. The following year, the Governor of New York directed that American flags be flown on all public buildings on June 14, while in Chicago, more than 300,000 children participated in that city's first Flag Day celebration. 
   On May 30, 1916, President Woodrow Wilson established by proclamation the first official Federal Flag Day on June 14. On August 3, 1949, President Harry S Truman signed an Act of Congress designating June 14 of each year as National Flag Day. 
   So now, thanks to the inspiration of a pair of elementary school teachers who had the vision to bring to life a vivid bit of history for their young students, we are reminded to look out our windows for a bright bit of cloth floating on the breeze, and to recall the struggle that created it, and the great country which it represents so ably and so proudly. There is just nothing like it, nothing like the Stars and Stripes. For in that couple of yards of fabric, we can see the origin of our Nation, its beginnings. We can see the bit of British history that we all share, whether or not any English blood actually flows in our veins. It is in the very shape of our flag, with its red field split by white stripes of separation, in the white stars on a blue field supplanting the British crosses. We can sense the oppression of that unequal partnership. We can feel the frustration of being a subject colony in those white stripes that separate and break up the red field of the British trade flag. And, we can sense the purpose and optimism of the new nation, so eloquently portrayed by the ``new constellation'' of white stars against a deep blue sky. 
   I am proud to follow in the footsteps of B.J. Cigrand and George Balach, and pay homage to this anniversary date. I hope that my colleagues and those who are listening and watching through those electronic eyes, might offer their own salutes to the flag today, and resolve to celebrate today or future Flag Days by unfurling their own flags and flying them proudly. In my own house, over in McLean, I fly the flag when I am there and can watch the flag and take it down if raindrops start to fall. I hope that more Americans, and more American children, might be inspired by the sight of that flag and might do likewise, and that they might learn the history of their flag, and learn to honor and cherish and respect it, on Flag Day and every day. 
   I close with the stirring words of Henry Holcomb Bennett, who wrote ``The Flag Goes By:''  
   Hats off! 
   Along the street there comes 
   A blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums, 
   A flash of color beneath the sky: 
   Hats off! 
   The flag is passing by!  
   Blue and crimson and white it shines, 
   Over the steel-tipped, ordered lines. 
   Hats off! 
   The colors before us fly; 
   But more than the flag is passing by:  
   Sea-fights and land-fights, grim and great, 
   Fought to make and to save the State; 
   Weary marches and sinking ships; 
   Cheers of victory on dying lips:  
   Days of plenty and years of peace; 
   March of a strong land's swift increase; 
   Equal justice, right and law, 
   Stately honor and reverend awe;  
   Sign of a nation great and strong 
   To ward her people from foreign wrong: 
   Pride and glory and honor, all 
   Live in the colors to stand or fall.  
   Hats off! 
   Along the street there comes 
   A blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums; 
   And loyal hearts are beating high: 
   Hats off! 
   The flag is passing by!  
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the managers for accepting my amendment making up to $3 million available to analyze the cost and feasibility of restarting the production line for the U-2 aircraft at a production rate of two aircraft per year. 
   The U-2 has proven itself to be the workhorse of our airborne intelligence reconnaissance system. We saw the value of its capabilities graphically demonstrated during the Kosovo air operation, where it was an integral part of the air strike mission. Unfortunately, the Kosovo air operation also revealed how bare the cupboard is in terms of U-2 aircraft. The scarcity of U-2 aircraft in our inventory--fewer than three dozen operational aircraft--was sharply accentuated by the Kosovo crisis. To move our U-2 assets into Kosovo, we were forced into the difficult position of drawing down our U-2 capabilities in other theatres. 
   Would the Chairman agree that U.S. commanders-in-chief around the world, including the Southern Command, which is in charge of intelligence relating to the drug war in Colombia, rely extensively on the U-2 and yet lack the assets needed to completely fulfill their requirements, so that even in the absence of a regional crisis such as Kosovo, our U-2 resources are thinly stretched?

   Mr. BYRD. Given the current attrition rate of U-2 aircraft, approximately one a year, the situation will only worsen. Moreover, I understand that the research and development effort to develop unmanned aerial vehicles such as Global Hawk, while promising, is still immature. Yet we do not now have a U-2 production line in place to replace the aircraft that we lose through attrition. In the interests of ensuring that we have an adequate inventory of reconnaissance aircraft to meet the needs of the commanders-in-chief, would the Chairman agree that it would be prudent for the Defense Department to keep its options open and, at a minimum, prepare an analysis of the cost and feasibility of restarting the U-2 production line?

It is my intent, and I hope the Chairman would agree, that the findings of this analysis should be provided to Congress in an unclassified report prior to next April, when the next budget will be considered, so that we will have the necessary information on which to base our decisions.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I have sought recognition at this time to address some remarks to the Department of Defense appropriations bill. 
   I commend the managers of the bill, Chairman STEVENS and Senator INOUYE, for their work on this measure. These two Senators have a vast knowledge, and it goes all across the areas of the Defense Department. They have been at this work a long time. Their hearts are in it, and they are highly dedicated to it. Their combined efforts are always evident in the annual DOD appropriations bill. This year's bill is  no exception--it is a well-balanced and comprehensive measure. 
   In recent years, the committee has had to provide for ever-increasing demands on our military--primarily in peacekeeping activities around the world. Our military personnel are scattered around the world--they are skilled and dedicated men and women, ever vigilant in their duty--charged with the responsibility of protecting the security of our country and its citizens. But they have in more recent times also been charged with the responsibility of acting as peacekeepers in many troubled areas around the globe. 
   Under these circumstances, it is very difficult to craft Defense appropriations bills. It has been nearly impossible to determine just how long and to what extent our military personnel might be needed in some of these peacekeeping operations, and what the estimated costs thereof might be. That situation exists today, for example, in Bosnia. It exists in southwest Asia, in Kosovo, and even in Haiti. 
   So I take my hat off to our managers for their dedication, not only this year but for many previous years, in working through these challenges to provide the funding necessary to 
   carry out these efforts. 
   The bill before us today clearly addresses the most critical needs of our military personnel and their families. The 3.7-percent pay raise recommended by the Senate Armed Services Committee is fully funded in this bill. Sufficient resources are also included to improve the health care benefits of our military retirees. And more than $96.7 billion is provided for the readiness of our military forces. 
   It is imperative that Congress provide funding for these important programs to demonstrate to the men and women in uniform who are serving our country throughout the world our strong and unwavering support for them. 
   Furthermore, this bill does not neglect our necessary defense modernization requirements. It provides funding for all of the highest priority programs identified by our military leaders and requested by the administration. 
   So I congratulate Senator STEVENS, chairman of the appropriations subcommittee--he is also chairman, of course, of the full Appropriations Committee--and Senator INOUYE for their dedication and hard work, and I know that my colleagues will support passage of the bill. 
   I also take this opportunity to recognize in a very special way our ranking member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator DANIEL INOUYE, who will be honored next week, at which time he will receive the Nation's highest military award for valor--the Congressional Medal of Honor. 
   How proud it makes all of us feel that we have someone like DANIEL INOUYE here as a Senator in our midst as we think of the sacrifices that he made. 
   Senator INOUYE was first elected to the Senate in 1963 from our 50th State. 
   Mr. President, I am proud to say that I am one who voted for Statehood on behalf of both Alaska and Hawaii. I believe that I am the only Senator left remaining here who voted for statehood for both of these States. I am proud of having done that. 
   He was first elected, as I say, to the Senate in 1963 from Hawaii, the 50th State. I think I am correct in saying that I am only one of three Members of today's Senate who were also here when he joined this body. 
   When I first came to the Senate, there were 96 Members of the Senate. Upon my being sworn in, the two new Senators from the new State of Alaska were sworn in with me, making a total of 98 Senators. Later in the year, Hawaii, the new State, the 50th State, sent two Senators, two new Senators to the Senate, making a total of 100 Senators to comprise this body. 
   I have had the pleasure of working with DANNY INOUYE on many occasions over the years. I have found him to be a man of the utmost integrity, who has worked tirelessly in the Senate on behalf of his constituents and on behalf of the Nation. 
   He was a Senator who was extremely supportive of me when I was the majority leader of this body. He was supportive of me when I was minority leader. He was very supportive of me when I was chairman of the Appropriations Committee of the Senate. He is certainly a Senator on whom one can rely for truth, for integrity, for steadfastness, for forthrightness, and as one who is extremely and highly dedicated to his work. 
   Like many others in this body, I view Senator INOUYE as a national hero. I know of his wartime heroics in France and in Italy. I read about how he fought to protect the troops with whom he served without regard for his own life. He doesn't talk much about it, but we know about it. He was gravely wounded in serving his country, yet he continued to fight. I am immensely proud of this outstanding American in our midst. 
   For many in Congress, in our hearts we have felt that DANNY INOUYE richly deserves the special recognition he earned in those bloody battles some 55 years ago. We are deeply moved and so proud that he is now to receive the highest military honor that can be bestowed upon any American citizen, the Congressional Medal of Honor. 
 It isn't enough to say in our hearts That we like a man for his ways; It isn't enough that we fill our minds With psalms of silent praise; Nor is it enough that we honor a man As our confidence upward mounts; It's going right up to the man himself And telling him so that counts. 
 If a man does a work that you really admire, 
 Don't leave a kind word unsaid. In fear to do so might make him vain And cause him to lose his head. But reach out your hand and tell him, ``Well done.'' And see how his gratitude swells. It isn't the flowers we strew on the grave, It's the word to the living that tells.  
   Well done, our friend, our colleague, our hero.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate is making important strides in working to improve health care benefits for our military retirees. A case in point is the Defense Authorization measure before the Senate today, which includes significant improvements in pharmacy benefits for military beneficiaries as well as several demonstration projects intended to evaluate long range health care solutions for military retirees. 
   But more needs to be done. We recognize that, and we are working to remedy the current situation. Senator WARNER's proposal to permit military retirees aged 64 or older to remain under CHAMPUS and TRICARE by requiring these plans to be secondary payers to Medicare is a good step in the right direction, a responsible step, and I strongly support it. 
   I also commend Senator JOHNSON for the laudatory goal of his amendment, but absent a plan to pay for such a sweeping reform, I fear that we are getting ahead of ourselves. The Senate has not set aside any money to pay for this proposal, and without a sure source of funding, we are offering our military retirees little more than an empty promise. For this reason, I am opposed to waiving the budget point of order against the Johnson amendment. 
   The Senate has been moving toward improved medical benefits for all members of the military, active and retired, over the past several years. Health care benefits remain a top priority. Senator WARNER's proposal to provide specific enhanced health benefits for older retirees for a three-year period while continuing to explore, test, and evaluate a long term solution is a prudent course of action. It gives us the opportunity to address the immediate health care needs of military retirees, while also giving Congress needed time to assess the best long-term solution, and to provide the necessary funding for whatever solution we reach.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today, May 25, in the year of our Lord 2000, marks the 213th anniversary of a monumental event, the most monumental event that ever occurred in American history. It was on May 25, 1787, that a sufficient number of State delegations convened in Philadelphia to begin their deliberations ``to form a more perfect Union.'' Fifty-five delegates labored through that long, hot summer in Independence Hall in the very room where the Declaration of Independence had been signed 11 years earlier. By September 17 of that year, when they adjourned sine die, they had produced a remarkable document, the most remarkable document of its kind that was ever written, the Constitution of the United States. 
   I place only the King James version of the Holy Bible above this document, the Constitution of the United States. That is the remarkable document that established our Federal Government, that provided for a U.S. Senate, that provided for the equality of the small States with the large States. That is the document that made it possible for tiny, mountainous West Virginia to have two votes, to be equal to the great State of New York, to be equal to the great States of California, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, Indiana in the Senate. If it were not for this document which I hold in my hand, the Constitution of the United States, we wouldn't be here today. I wouldn't be here. The distinguished Presiding Officer who comes from the State of Illinois would not be here. He would not be presiding in that chair. These would not be the United States of America. In all likelihood, they would be the ``Balkanized States of America.'' 
   This remarkable document has established our Federal Government. It is fitting, therefore, that we pause today, and I thought it fitting that someone take the floor to remark about the importance of this day in history and the importance of this document. It is fitting that we pause to reflect on what those men who met at the Constitutional Convention hoped to accomplish and to remark on what they achieved. 
   The fledgling United States was in dire straits in 1787. There were no automobiles. There were no airplanes, no diesel motor trains, no electric lights, no sulfa drugs, no antibiotics in 1787. It had become painfully apparent that the first National Government under the Articles of Confederation was not working. 
   Having thrown off the yoke of royal rule during the Revolution, Americans at first had been reluctant to establish another strong central government. Not many people, I wager, in this country remember much, if anything, about the Articles of Confederation, our first Constitution, but our forebears had created a Government under the Articles of Confederation that represented little more than a loose association of 13 States, with the States retaining the real power. Those States were the former Colonies. 
   The National Government consisted of a single legislative body. Most of the governments in the world today consist of unicameral legislative bodies, one legislative body. But there are 61 governments in the world today that have bicameral legislatures. Most of the larger countries have bicameral legislative bodies. There are 61 of them. And in only two, the United States and Italy, are the upper chambers not subordinate to the lower chambers. 
   Each State, under the Articles of Confederation, regardless of size--whether it was Pennsylvania, New York, tiny Delaware, Rhode Island, or Georgia--each State, regardless of size, had a single vote in the Congress, in that one body. Under the Articles of Confederation, Congress could raise money only by asking the States for it. Congress had no power to force a State to pay its share. At times, Congress lacked the funds to pay its soldiers' salaries and faced the threat of mutiny. General George Washington faced that threat of mutiny. The Nation's international credit remained weak because of its war debts, which went unpaid due to wrangling between and among the States. 
   This discouraged foreign investments--as one could imagine--and further complicated the efforts to fund the Government operations. 
   As economic conditions worsened, a band of farmers in western Massachusetts, led by the Revolutionary War veteran, Daniel Shays, shut down the State courts to stop their creditors from foreclosing on their lands. I wonder what Senator TED KENNEDY would think of that today. How would Senator JOHN KERRY feel about that--Shays' Rebellion? And not only did they close down the courts to stop their creditors from foreclosing on their lands, but they also attacked the Federal arsenal at Springfield. When Massachusetts appealed for assistance, Congress had neither an adequate army nor adequate funds to suppress Shays' Rebellion. 
   George Washington, who had retired to his estate at Mount Vernon after commanding American forces during the Revolutionary War, feared for the survival of his country and predicted ``the worst consequences from a half-starved, limping Government, always moving upon crutches and tottering at every step.'' That was George Washington, the first President and the greatest President ever of the United States. 
   In 1785, a dispute over navigation rights on the Potomac River prompted the States of Virginia and Maryland to set up a meeting to settle their differences. Maryland's delegation went to Alexandria, VA, only to find that Virginia's delegates had not yet arrived. They had no interstate highways. They had no great bridges that spanned the river. They had no airplanes. There was no airport over at National in those days. There were only horses and buggies. 
   As I say, Maryland's delegation went to Alexandria, VA, only to find that Virginia's delegates had not yet arrived. Anxious for the conference not to fail, George Washington graciously invited the delegates to Mount Vernon. There the two delegations discussed tolls and fishing rights on the Potomac. Where does the Potomac rise? It rises in my State, in West Virginia. Of course, there was no West Virginia in those days, but there was Virginia. And other questions were raised that went beyond their immediate disputes. When the Virginia delegates submitted their report to the Virginia Assembly, it went to a committee chaired by James Madison, Jr. 
   Convinced that larger issues remained, Madison persuaded the assembly to pass a resolution calling for a convention in the States to deal with interstate commerce. In the fall of 1786, that convention met in Annapolis, MD. You see, if it were today, Senators BARBARA MIKULSKI and PAUL SARBANES would be there. But it was long before their time. That convention could do nothing, since only 6 of the 13 States sent representatives. Spurred by Madison of Virginia and Alexander Hamilton of New York, the Annapolis convention called for another convention the following year in Philadelphia to go beyond commercial disputes and consider creating a Federal Government strong enough to meet the needs of the new Nation.  
   On May 14, 1787, the date set for that convention to open, a quorum could not be attained. Not until May 25--213 years ago today--did delegates from a majority of the States arrive. That was an important day--the day that a quorum of delegates arrived. Eventually, all but Rhode Island would send delegates. 
   With a quorum established, they got down to business by unanimously electing George Washington as their Presiding 
   Officer. Talk about a great President, one that all the subsequent Presidents--I am sure most of them--have tried to emulate, there was the greatest President of all, George Washington, first in the hearts of his countrymen. His great prestige, the delegates knew, would help to quiet public suspicion of the convention's intent. That convention closed its doors. They didn't open the doors to the public. They locked the doors and established sentries at the doors and conducted its proceedings in secret. That was a good thing. 
   According to James Madison's notes from May 25, Washington, ``in a very emphatic manner ..... thanked the convention for the honor they had conferred on him, reminded them of the novelty of the scene of business in which he was to act, lamented his want of better qualifications, and claimed the indulgence of the House toward the involuntary errors which his inexperience might occasion.'' The convention then elected a secretary and appointed a committee to prepare its standing rules. The convention knew the importance of standing rules. The convention had learned that from the colonial legislatures, the State legislatures, and from Parliament in the motherland. Several of those forebears came from England, Scotland, and Ireland; they were all subjects of Great Britain, of course. They knew about Parliament. So, they prepared standing rules. 
   Over the next 3 months, the delegates crafted an entirely new Federal Government for the United States. Ever fearful of tyranny, they solved the problem of concentration of power by dividing responsibilities among three equal branches of Government. O, that more of our people today would study American history! I am not talking about social studies; I am talking about history--American history. O, that more of our Members would refresh their memories concerning American history! How many times have I reminded ourselves of the importance of the checks and balances, the separation of powers, the fact that there are three equal and coordinate branches of Government? 
   As pragmatists who doubted the perfectibility of human beings, they assumed--those delegates at the convention--that strong individuals and groups would always grasp for more power--and they were right--which would be dangerous, even if meant for good purposes. They, the delegates, believed that government evolved from the people and, indeed, they began their document with the words: ``We the People.'' 
   But they also anticipated that public opinion would swing wildly--swing like a pendulum--wildly at times, and that public passions could get swept away in the frenzies of the moment. Some people glibly refer to our form of government as a democracy. When you hear someone say that form of government is a democracy, mark that person as not knowing what he is talking about. That person does not know what he is talking about when he says that this Government is a democracy. It is not. Rather than a democracy, the Framers created a representative government, a republic, with elaborate checks and balances. 
   If we want to understand the difference between a democracy and a republic, let James Madison explain the difference in Federalist No. 10 and Federalist No. 14. 
   As James Madison later explained in the Federalist: ``If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: You must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.'' 
   Mr. President, because the U.S. Constitution still functions essentially the way its authors intended, and because it has been amended only 27 times in the past two centuries, that Constitutional convention has sometimes been celebrated as the ``Miracle at Philadelphia,'' and the delegates praised by none less than Thomas Jefferson as ``demigods,'' suggesting that their work was divinely inspired. In point of fact, the convention was a long, hard, bitterly-debated ordeal that on several occasions came close to collapse. They did not have air-conditioning in those days. Those summers were just as hot as they are now, I suppose. The delegates needed to reach several crucial compromises before enough of them would agree to the new constitution. One of these compromises--known as the Great Compromise--created the U.S. Senate as a means of satisfying the smaller states' demands for equality, while the House of Representatives would grant more votes to the larger states by apportioning on the basis of population. Another pivotal compromise--the Three-Fifths Compromise--addressed the emotional issue of human slavery, by permitting slaves to be counted as three-fifths of a person for purposes of taxation and representation. Without the agreement, the Southern states would not have ratified the new constitution. Yet, it left in place the peculiar institution of slavery that eventually would tear the nation apart in civil war. 
   In other words, Mr. President, as remarkable as was the Constitution that emerged from Philadelphia in 1787, and as much as it solved the problems that had festered under the Articles of Confederation, it was not a finished document. Despite the towering presence of George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Madison, Mason, and other wise and trusted leaders at the Constitutional convention, there remained deep public suspicion over this new government, which after all had been debated entirely in secret session. Some delegates refused to sign the Constitution because it lacked protection of individual rights. This omission proved a major obstacle to the ratification of the Constitution, leading Madison to pledge his support for a series of amendments while the ink on the Constitution was still wet. During the First Congress, as a member of the House of Representatives, Madison proposed the first ten amendments, known as the Bill of Rights, and two other amendments not ratified at the time (one of which more recently resurfaced as the 27th amendment) and which we remember in our own time here in the Senate. 
   The late Justice Thurgood Marshall once commented that he could not admire the framers' decision to compromise with slavery, and that, therefore, he preferred to celebrate the Constitution as ``a living document, including the Bill of Rights and other amendments protecting individual freedoms and human rights.'' Several amendments to the Constitution were more administrative in scope, designed to fix flaws in the Electoral College, change the calendar for congressional sessions and presidential inaugurations, and permit the levying of a federal income tax. But most of the amendments dealt with expanding democratic rights and freedoms, from the abolition of slavery to the extension of the right to vote to blacks, women, and 18-year-olds, and even for the right of the people to directly elect their United States senators. These few amendments have improved the original document. Yet, in so many respects the Constitution remains unchanged. Today, each branch of the government retains essentially the same powers it was given in 1787--albeit magnified to meet the challenges of subsequent centuries. Ours, as Justice Thurgood Marshall reminded us, is a living Constitution. 
   If the Holy Bible were small enough, I would carry that with me, too. This is the Constitution of the United States. Fortunately, it is a small document. It is a compact document that fits comfortably inside my shirt pocket, and several Senators in this body carry the Constitution in their pockets. It is far shorter than most State constitutions, including my own West Virginia Constitution. It does not take long to read. But each time one reads it, one will find something new in that Constitution--some thought that did not occur to that individual before. 
   It does not take long to read, and yet opinion polls show that many Americans have either never read it or have  forgotten most of what they learned about it in school. That may also go for a good many of the Members of this body, and the other body. It would be very well if all Members of the Senate and House reread the Constitution from time to time. It is vital that all Americans familiarize themselves with this document so that they know their constitutional rights and their constitutional responsibilities. 
   Let me suggest, therefore, that May 25, marking the anniversary of the day the Constitutional Convention got down to business, would be an appropriate day for all of us to once again read the Constitution and to appreciate the framers' efforts ``to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.'' 
   This coming Monday is Memorial Day, May 29. On that day, Edmund Randolph, Governor of the State of Virginia, presented his 15 resolves, his 15 resolutions to the convention. The debates in those ensuing days largely centered around Randolph's resolutions, or the so-called Virginia plan. So, I say to my colleagues, remember this coming Monday. That was the day when the convention first heard about the Virginia plan. 
   Long live the memories of the Framers of the U.S. Constitution!

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this is not quite as important a subject to my listeners, perhaps, as the words I have just spoken, but it is an important subject to me, because next Monday, the Lord willing--in the Book of James, we are told always not to say, I'll do this or I will do that tomorrow; I'll go here or I'll go there tomorrow; always say, ``the Lord willing'' --next Monday, the Lord willing, my wife and I will celebrate our 63rd wedding anniversary. 
   I have to frankly say that what little I have amounted to, if it is anything much, I owe for the most part to her. She saw to it that I earned a law degree. She virtually put me through law school by her caring ways. She fulfilled the responsibilities at home, rearing our children while I was busy. She went to the store, she did the buying, she did the washing, she did the ironing, she pressed my clothes. She mopped the floors, she vacuumed the carpets, she did the work. I have never seen a person who was a harder worker than my wife and the woman who raised me, my old foster mother, my aunt. 
   But Erma is the one to whom credit is due. She has set the kind of example for me over the years that I have not been able to emulate fully. This coming Monday, I am going to show her my appreciation by going back to the hills with her. On Monday, we will finish reading the King James version of the Holy Bible together. We are down to where we lack four chapters. We try to read the Bible every Sunday--not that I am somebody who is good; the Bible says that no man is good; not that I am somebody good --but she and I read that Bible every Sunday. Three or four months ago, I counted the number of chapters remaining, and it came out to where if I divided them in a way that we would read six chapters every Sunday, we could finish the Bible, the reading of the Holy Bible, from beginning to end, the old testament and the new, on next Monday, our wedding anniversary. We lack four chapters, and God willing, we will finish those four chapters next Monday. 
   After that day, we will be on our way to our 64th wedding anniversary.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as I am talking about the Bible, I want to call attention to a good man who works in this Capitol. He is a detective. His name is John Euill. 
   Every time this little publication comes out, he brings it to me. The title of it is, ``Our Daily Bread.'' John Euill always brings that to me. Of course, we are not supposed to call attention to anyone in the galleries in the Chamber, but I am going to call attention to someone who is sitting on the Chamber bench on the Republican side right now. All of our Members have shaken his hand. He is courteous. John Euill is a wonderful man. 
   Let me read just a few words from ``Our Daily Bread,'' which he gave me today. The chapter titled, ``Building on the Bible'':  
   What can be done to improve society? An MTV political correspondent had this unexpected but praiseworthy suggestion: ``No matter how secular our culture becomes, it will remain drenched in the Bible. Since we will be haunted by the Bible even if we don't know it, doesn't it make sense to read it?'' 
   Our culture is indeed ``drenched in the Bible.'' Whether or not the majority of people realize it, the principles on which the United States was founded, and the values which still permeate our national life, were based on the Holy Scriptures.  
   If Senators don't believe that, go back and read the Mayflower Compact and many of the other great documents that form the basis of this great Nation.  
   Yet, God's Word no longer occupies the commanding place it held in the past.  
   And that is true.  
   Its ethics are sometimes still praised even though biblical morality is flagrantly violated. So I agree with the political correspondent's urging that people read the Bible.
   We need to do more, however, than just read the Word of God. We need to believe the Bible and put its inspired teachings into practice. The psalmist reminded us that we are to walk in God's ways, to keep His precepts diligently, and to seek Him with our whole heart.  
   Psalm 119, the second through the fourth verses. I am going to read those verses for the people who are watching through that electronic eye above the presiding chair. I want in my small way to dedicate them today to Detective John Euill.  
   Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him with the whole heart. 
   They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways. 
   Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.  
   I thank all Senators for their patience, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have sought recognition at this time to commend the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator BENNETT, and the ranking member, Senator FEINSTEIN, for their efforts in bringing out of the Appropriations Committee and out of their subcommittee prior thereto, a bill which I know that all Senators can support. 
   As noted by the Chairman and Ranking Member, the allocation to the Legislative Branch Subcommittee here in the Senate was substantially larger than the amount allocated to the Subcommittee's House counterpart. That increased allocation was distributed fairly throughout the Legislative Branch. 
   In particular, as has been noted by Chairman BENNETT and Senator FEINSTEIN, the bill as reported by the Committee recommends a substantial increase for the Capitol Police. I commend these two very able Senators for their excellent work in recommending this increase for the Capitol Police and for the increases they recommended throughout the legislative branch. It should be kept in mind something that Members of this body often forget, perhaps at least temporarily, that the Legislative Branch is the people's branch. 
   I stand here on this floor time after time to say that again and again that this is the first of the three branches of our Government mentioned in the Constitution, article I. We should adequately fund the legislative branch. I believe this bill does so. We certainly bend over backwards time and time again to fund the executive branch, and the executive branch includes in its budget on every occasion that a budget that comes here, additional persons for various segments of the executive branch. In many instances, few questions are asked, if any. So the executive branch adds to its numbers by the hundreds, from time to time. Yet we respond quite niggardly with appropriations for the legislative branch. We are always pinching pennies when it comes to the legislative branch. 
   The Legislative Branch Appropriations bill, as reported by the House Appropriations Committee, contains major cuts throughout the legislative branch, including the appropriation for the Capitol Police. Rather than recommending an increase sufficient to continue the growth in the Capitol Police force that we approved two years ago as a result of the tragic shooting that took the lives of Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson, the bill, reported by the other body 
   requires dramatic reductions in the Capitol Police force. Through a combination of the regular Fiscal Year 2000 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act and the additional funding that had already been provided in the Omnibus Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1999, sufficient resources have been provided for 1,511 Capitol Police personnel. That increase in personnel was carefully considered as part of an overall plan to improve security of the U.S. Capitol complex. It was to be a multi-year effort with these additional forces being brought on board as quickly as the new hires could be trained. Yet, that is not what has been recommended in the bill as reported in this year's bill by the House Appropriations Committee. That recommendation provides only $70 million, a cut of almost $39 million below the budget request, and provides for a level of only 1058 personnel, a reduction of 453 positions! Think about that. We all talk about how strongly we support reducing crime throughout the Nation. Let's  start right here in the Nation's Capitol, right now! We have put 100,000 cops on the beat across the Nation. A number of years ago, Senator GRAMM of Texas and I offered an amendment which was subsequently enacted to establish a Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund. 
   I was chairman of the Appropriations Committee in the Senate at that time. Since that time, tens of billions of dollars have been appropriated over the years from that trust fund. As a result, we have seen a marked improvement in the statistics on violent crime all across this Nation. When the tragic shooting of Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson occurred in the Nation's Capitol in the summer of 1998, we all quickly rushed forward with promises of increased funding for the security measures for the Capitol complex. 
   I have seen this happen time and time and time again over the 48 years I have been virtually an inhabitant of this building. The distinguished Senator from Illinois said a moment ago he first came to this building 38 years ago. Mr. President, I came to this building my first time almost 70 years ago. I was a boy scout from the coal fields in southern West Virginia. Of course, it was never meant that I should ever become a Member of this body, not from the lowly beginnings from which I sprang. Upon that occasion when I sat up in the galleries, I said to the scoutmaster: I'm coming back here one day; I'm going to be a Member of this body. How little did I know that that might come true, really, when I came to this Capitol almost 70 years ago. 
   I was a Member of the other body when the shooting occurred in the gallery of that body. I was sitting on the opposite side, on the Democratic side, from where the shooting took place. The shooting occurred from the galleries just over the Republican side of the aisle. At first, I thought it was a demonstration of some kind, perhaps some firecrackers or some blank bullets. 
   I saw--I believe it was one of the Members named Jensen. I saw other Members fall. I saw one fall right in the center of the floor, towards the front of the House Chamber. I saw Members running to the Cloakroom.

   Mr. BYRD. The Senator was talking about how the Capitol Police are careful to search our briefcases and to be on the alert for all people who walk through the doors. 
   A couple weeks ago, after I reached my house one evening, I got to looking for something, and I decided I left it on my desk in my office. 
   I said to my wife: I am going back up to the Capitol. 
   She said: Do you want me to go with you? 
   I said: Yes. 
   She and I are going to be married, by the way, this coming Monday, 63 years. 
   As I said, she said: Do you want me to go with you? 
   Anyhow, she came up here with me. I had already changed clothes. I had an old slouch rainhat on. I had some old wear-around-the-house trousers and some scuffy-looking shoes. I came up here with a slouch sweatshirt and had it outside my trousers. 
   I walked in down here and went through the magnetometer. I guess I am the only Senator who goes through the magnetometer. I don't know. But I do. I do that so the police and others who may get some complaints from some people who go through that magnetometer can say, Senator BYRD, who has been around this floor longer than any other Member of the House or Senate, who has been around here longer than any staff member on this Hill, goes through that. 
   So I went through that magnetometer. And there were two policemen standing there. They were not the regular attendants at the door. And they did not see any ID card on me with a chain around my neck. So one of them said to me: Sir, are you a staff member? And I laughed. I said: No, I'm not a staff member. I just want to compliment you on doing the kind of job you are supposed to do. No, I'm not a staff member. 
   So they were on the alert. They did what they were supposed to do. I salute them for it. I thank the Senator for yielding.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Michigan says this vote is not about power. He says it is about the wisdom of taking a vote on this matter. I hope I am not mischaracterizing his statement. 
   I say to him that this matter is about power. It is about the arrogance of power and a White House that insists on putting our men and women in harm's way and spending their tax dollars without the consent of their elected representatives. Where is the wisdom in that course? Where is the wisdom in allowing a policy of indefinite drift in the Balkans with no end strategy and no clearly defined goal? 
   We have heard a great deal of impassioned, occasionally inflammatory, debate over Kosovo in recent hours, the first such debate we have had since U.S. ground troops entered Kosovo 11 months ago as part of a NATO peacekeeping operation. 
   I welcome this debate. It's about time. And I am glad that so many Senators are engaged in this debate. But before we bring this discussion to a head, I think that we need to address some of the more outrageous claims that have been made about the Byrd-Warner provision. To hear some speak, this amendment will mean the end of civilization as we know it. Hardly. Hardly. I appreciate the usefulness of hyperbole in speech making as much as anyone, but it is time to bring this debate back to the realm of reality. 
   I have also heard, over and over again, that this provision is a slap in the face of our allies; that they are already shouldering the lion's share of the peacekeeping and reconstruction burden in Kosovo, and that what we are doing is tantamount to abandoning NATO. I simply don't buy that. I believe that Congress has every right to demand an accounting from the President on the level of effort that all the participants are expending in Kosovo. That to me is not a slap in the face of the allies; that is basic bookkeeping. 
   I read carefully the letter that General Wesley Clark, former Supreme Allied Commander of NATO forces in Europe, sent to Senator LEVIN. I was frankly shocked at his conclusions. Gen. Clark wrote: ``In fact, these measures''--referring to the Byrd-Warner provision--``would invalidate the policies, commitments and trust of our Allies in NATO, undercut U.S. leadership worldwide''--how ridiculous--``and encourage renewed ethnic tension, fighting and instability in the Balkans. Furthermore, they would, if enacted, invalidate the dedication and commitment of our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines, disregarding the sacrifices they and their families have made to help bring peace to the Balkans.'' 
   The Byrd-Warner provision is directed squarely at the institutional and constitutional responsibilities of 
   Congress. Contrary to so much of the rhetoric that we have been hearing, the Byrd-Warner provision does not establish, as General Clark suggested, ``a de facto deadline for a U.S. pullout'' from Kosovo. 
   Those are strong words. Unfortunately, they wrongly characterize the Byrd-Warner provision. Our language does not establish a ``de facto deadline for U.S. pullout'' from Kosovo. The only deadlines our amendment establishes are directed at the President.--who may be Mr. Bush or Mr. GORE--and require him to seek congressional authorization to continue the deployment of U.S. ground combat troops in Kosovo. 
   Yes, I believe that U.S. ground combat troops should be withdrawn from Kosovo, in a safe, orderly, and phased withdrawal. 
   Our provision gives the administration a year to come up with an exit strategy. We don't have one. Is it too much to ask that we have one? It requires that two plans outlining a withdrawal be submitted to Congress--an interim plan to be submitted by the current President, Mr. Clinton, and a final plan to be submitted by the next President, be it Mr. Bush or Mr. GORE.  
   Moreover, our provision explicitly directs this President and the next President to develop their plans in consultation with our NATO allies, and to ensure that the plans provide for an orderly transition to an all-European ground troop element in Kosovo. We are not pulling the rug out from under our NATO allies. We are not discouraging them from seeing the job through. We are encouraging them to take full responsibility, in terms of ground combat troops, for the security of the Balkans. We are encouraging our allies to meet their commitments in Kosovo. We are encouraging them to demonstrate that the United States does not always have to be the lead dog in a NATO operation. 
   I have heard it said that the Byrd-Warner provision could deal a death blow to NATO; that the alliance will crumble if the United States brings a few thousand men and women home from Kosovo. That kind of talk is reckless; it is demoralizing to our allies. The NATO alliance will not collapse if the United States does not have ground combat troops in Kosovo. And if by some chance the allies are so shaky that the Byrd-Warner Kosovo provision would cause it to disintegrate, then I think we need to give some thought as to why we are lending such a major amount of support to such a paper tiger. I believe the United States is the strongest member of NATO, but I do not believe for a moment the United States has to prop up NATO at every step of the way. 
   Let me return for a moment to the notion that the Byrd-Warner provision sets a de facto deadline for a pullout of troops from Kosovo. Let me assure you that if Senator WARNER and I wanted to set a deadline for a pullout of forces from Kosovo, we would set it, and we would set it in stone. We do not do that. The Byrd-Warner provision does not mandate a troop withdrawal from Kosovo. Yes, it anticipates such a possible outcome, but it does not mandate it. If, in the wisdom of the next President, it is necessary to continue the deployment of U.S. ground combat troops in Kosovo, or if events in that troubled region of the world so dictate, our provision provides explicit direction for  the consideration, under expedited procedures, of a joint resolution authorizing the continued deployment of U.S. ground combat troops in Kosovo. 
   The intent of our provision is not to micromanage the Pentagon or the State Department. The intent of the provision is to restore congressional oversight--restore congressional oversight--to the Kosovo peacekeeping operation. By its inaction, Congress has allowed the executive branch to usurp Congress' constitutional authority in this matter. That is our fault, but it need not be our fault. We need not continue to let that happen. 
   The Founding Fathers vested in Congress alone the power of the purse. The Constitution is very clear on this matter. Article I, section 9 of the Constitution states:  
   No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law. .....  
   Yet what are we seeing? We are seeing in Kosovo, as we 
   have seen in so many other peacekeeping operations, a bastardization of that process. Instead of Congress appropriating funds for expenditure by the executive branch, the executive branch has adopted the practice--arrogant practice--of spending the money first. That is what they have done here--spending the money first and then asking Congress after the fact to pay the bills. 
   I wonder if my colleagues can see the pattern here: Buy now, pay later. Spend the money first, borrow from the military readiness accounts, and then give Congress no alternative but to reimburse the money. That is what has happened here. Trust me, this is not what the Founding Fathers had in mind when they created the Constitution of this Nation. 
   As heir to that wisdom, every Senator has a duty to guard vigilantly the rights bestowed on Congress by the Constitution, and no such right is more central to the separation of powers on which our system of Government is built than the vesting in Congress alone the power of the purse. 
   The issue is not only what policy the United States should be following in Kosovo; the issue is also whether the Congress is upholding its authority, its powers, its rights and responsibilities under the Constitution. I submit that by allowing the executive branch to de facto determine the expenditure of appropriated funds, we are not. 
   It was reported some months ago that the United States is building--hear this--semipermanent military buildings at Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo. These so-called C-huts are designed to last 5 years before major repairs are required. According to a report in the Washington Times on March 1, the Army is putting up 300 of these structures at a cost of about $175,000 each. Well, you can do the math yourself. It adds up to a $52.5 million investment in military construction in Kosovo. This sounds to me like the U.S. military is putting down serious roots, long-time roots, deep roots, in Kosovo. 
   The fiscal year 2001 military construction appropriations bill is the matter pending before the Senate today. Scores of needed infrastructure projects that must be funded by this bill have gone begging because there is not enough military construction funding to go around. The $52.5 million being spent to construct those C-huts in Kosovo would go a long way toward funding some of the backlog of projects that we have in this country. Mind you, I believe that if the United States chooses to send its men and women in uniform on missions to far-flung parts of the world, they deserve a decent standard of living. 
   My question is: Why is the administration planning for a 5-year or more stay in Kosovo without bringing the matter to Congress? That is my question. Why are you, down there at the White House, and at the Pentagon--why are you, in the executive branch, planning for a 5-year stay or more in Kosovo without bringing the matter to Congress and getting Congress to authorize this? Should Congress not have a voice in the expenditure of the people's money? Should Congress not have a say in such deployments? Should the American people not have a voice in whether they support such a deployment, such a long-term deployment? I have read where some generals in NATO say it will be 5 years or it will be 10 years. Others have said it will be a generation. I believe Congress and the American people should--no, not should, but must--have a say in how the United States is deploying its increasingly scarce military resources. 
   We hear they have recruitment problems in the services, in all of the services, except perhaps for the Marines. They are having recruitment problems, we are spreading our forces thin all over the globe. 
   Time after weary time, we have had the same gambit from Administrations, both Democratic and Republican. Send the troops in, and Congress will not have the fortitude to pull the plug. Once we get the men in harms way, so the argument always goes, it is dangerous to talk about pulling them out. It is especially dangerous to set a date certain for them to leave. Heaven help us. Never do that. Don't set a date certain. How many times have we heard that same old tune? It turns logic on its head. Just as we went into Bosnia, they said we will just be there about a year. Now we are in the fifth year. That is the administration leading us in and then believing that Congress won't have the fortitude to pull the men and the women out. That kind of logic asks us to believe that pulling troops out of harm's way is potentially more dangerous than leaving them in harm's way. 
   The Executive Branch is much more inclined to use our military might to accomplish various policy objectives, such as nation building--policy objectives which may not be supported by the American people or their elected Representatives in the Congress. We have lately seen the use of American boys and girls to enforce objectives authorized only by U.N. Resolution, which raises a serious question of national sovereignty in the mind of this Senator. I have perused the Constitution very carefully over the years, and I see no reference to conflict by U.N. Resolution or NATO Resolution. It is the Congress and the Congress alone which the Framers entrusted with the awesome decisions to send America's sons, and now her daughters as well, into situations which might mean their death. 
   No armed conflict can succeed without the support of the American people. It didn't succeed in Vietnam because it didn't have the support of the American people. It is their sons and daughters which we send to fight and to possibly die. It is their tax dollars which pay for the missiles and the tanks and the bullets. We enter into armed conflict at our peril if there is no consensus among the people to take that course. And the best way that this Senator knows to achieve such a consensus is for such matters to be debated and debated thoroughly on the Floors of the Senate and the House of Representatives, and then for a vote to be taken that reflects the people's will. The most solemn duty which we have as legislators and as sworn representatives of the people who sent us here is to decide whether to ask young Americans to put their lives at risk. 
   To abdicate that duty to a President--to any President, a Democrat President or a Republican--to abdicate that duty to any chief executive is wrong. It circumvents the Constitution, it bypasses the people, and it short changes the nation because the people's will is never even known, never even known much less considered until the body bags start coming home. There are those who will say that this Kosovo provision sets up a process which is too cumbersome. Some will say that Congress cannot be asked to declare war every time there is a skirmish in the world. Well, of course, Congress should not have to frame an official declaration of war for each and every conflict. But, it should have to authorize in some way the conflict, and agree or disagree with its objectives. 
   Of course, the Administration will not like it. They never like it. They do not want to see the Congress exercise its constitutional duty in matters of this kind. They don't want Congress to lift a hand. They do not want Congress to say a word. Congress needs to be quiet. They want a free hand. The administration wants a free hand to participate in military adventurism whenever and wherever they please. And they do not brook interference by the Congress, the elected representatives of the people, the directly elected representatives of people, unlike the President who is indirectly elected by the people. Presidents are elected by the electors who are elected by the people. If they can avoid it, they don't  want the Congress to even whimper--just do not hear a peep, not a peep, out of Congress. But this is not the way it ought to be. 
   The military is not a plaything or toy, subject to the whim and caprice of a chief executive. The title ``Commander in Chief'' does not make any President a king, free to send America's men and women in uniform wherever he may bid them to go, free to commit America's resources to battle or to police actions or to peacekeeping without brooking any interference by Congress. Congress is not just the place that pays the bills although the executive branch would like that. They would like the Congress to be only the place to pay the bills. That is all. But Congress is not just a place to pay the bills. 
   The legislative department is an equal and coordinate department with the executive, even though it is sometimes hard for the executive branch to fully understand that. 
   As to the war powers, these are meant to be shared between the President and the people's elected Representatives in Congress. Let there be no doubt: The Framers intended for the Congress, in the final analysis, to hold the upper hand and have the final say. 
   That is why the framers vested the power over the purse in Congress. Let us take a look at the Constitution. I hold it in my hand. 
   These are the powers of Congress. Congress shall have the power ``To declare War.'' Congress shall have the power to ``grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal.'' Congress shall have the power to ``make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water.'' 
   Hear me. This is the Constitution speaking. 
   Congress also has the general power ``To raise and support Armies.'' 
   Congress shall have the power ``To provide and maintain a Navy.'' 
   Congress has the power ``To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.'' 
   Congress shall have the power ``To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repeal Invasions.'' 
   Congress shall have the power ``To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States.'' Add to these powers contained in this Constitution the power ``to exercise exclusive legislation . . . over all places . . . for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dock-yards, and other needful buildings . . .''. 
   Congress has the power ``To lay and collect Taxes'' to defend this country. 
   Congress shall have the power to ``provide for the common Defense.'' 
   That is what this Constitution says. 
   Congress shall have the power ``To borrow money on the credit of the United States.'' 
   That is what the Constitution says. 
   Congress shall have the power ``To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers.'' 
   And finally, this Constitution says, Congress has the greatest power of all. Congress is given the power in section 9, article I: ``No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by law.'' Thus, the scope of the warpower granted to Congress is, indeed, remarkable. The intent of the framers is clear. 
   Now let us examine the war powers that flow from the Constitution to the President of the United States. In section 2, article II, the Constitution states: ``The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States.'' 
   That is it. That is it, lock, stock, and barrel, except the Constitution says that the President ``shall Commission all the Officers of the United States.'' 
   But that is it. 
   So compare what the Constitution says with respect to the powers of the Congress when it comes to warmaking, when it comes to the military, with the powers the Constitution gives to the President: 
   The title, Commander in Chief, was given by the Framers to the President for a number of reasons. As Hamilton said in Federalist #74, the direction of war ``most peculiarly demands those qualities which distinguish the exercise of power by a single head.'' The power of directing war and emphasizing the common strength ``forms a usual and essential part in the definition of the executive authority.'' That has to be by a single head. This clause of the Constitution also protects the principle of civilian supremacy. 
   It says that the person who leads the Armed Forces will be a civilian president, not a military officer. 
   Consider the language in the Constitution: ``The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several states, when called into the actual service of the United States.'' With respect to the Army, the Congress, not the President, does the raising and the supporting; with respect to the Navy the Congress, not the President, does the providing and maintaining; with respect to the militia, when called into the actual service of the United States, Congress, not the President, does the calling. 
   So, the President is Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, but without the power of Congress, there can be no Army and Navy to command, and the President's title would be but an empty title. 
   Thus, we should clearly see that the Constitutional Framers took Blackstone's royal prerogatives and gave them either to Congress exclusively or assigned them on a shared basis to Congress and President. This Administration and most of the recent Administrations that have immediately preceded it seem never to have understood this salient fact that the President's warmaking powers are not omnipotent as were those of the King of Great Britain. The Framers gave the political compass a 180 degree turn. The delegates at the Philadelphia Convention repeatedly emphasized that the power of peace and war associated with the monarchy would not be given to a President of the United States. 
   Charles Pinckney, one of the delegates to the convention from South Carolina, supported a vigorous executive. Pinckney was afraid Executive powers of [the existing] might extend to peace and war &c which will Render the Executive and Monarchy, of the worst kind, to wit an elective one.' John Rutledge endorsed a single executive, `tho' he was not for giving him the power of war and peace.' Roger Sherman looked upon the President as an agent of Congress, and considered `the Executive majesty as nothing more than an institution for carrying the will of the Legislature into effect, that the person or persons ought to be appointed by and accountable to the Legislature only, which was the depositary of the supreme will of the Society.' 
   What about James Wilson of Pennsylvania?  
   James Wilson endorsed a single executive, but did not consider `the Prerogatives of the British Monarch as a proper guide in defining the Executive powers. Some of these prerogatives were of a Legislative nature. Among others that of war & peace &c.'  
   How about Alexander Hamilton from the great State of New York? 
   Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist #69, differentiated between the power of the monarchy and the power of the American President. Hamilton stated that the President, under the Constitution, has ``concurrent power with a branch of the legislature in the formation of treaties,'' whereas the British King ``is the sole possessor of the power of making treaties.'' 
   Control over the deployment of military forces was vested in Congress, as we can see from reading the Constitution. Madison emphasized that the Constitution ``supposes, what the History of all governments demonstrates, that the Executive is the branch of power most interested in war, and most prone to it.'' We have seen that to be the case. ``It has accordingly with studied care, vested the question of war in the legislature.'' 
   On the power of declaring war, from Madison's notes, an incisive colloquy occurred at the Constitutional Convention on August 17, 1787. I now read from Madison's notes: ``Mr. Madison and Mr. Gerry moved to insert `declare,' striking out `make' war; leaving to the Executive the power to repel sudden attacks. 
   ``Mr. Sherman thought it stood very well. The Executive should be able to repel and not to commence war. `Make' better than `declare' the latter narrowing the power too much.  
   ``Mr. Gerry never expected to hear in a Republic a motion to empower the Executive alone to declare war. 
   ``Mr. Ellsworth. There is a material difference between the cases of making war and making peace. It should be more easy to get out of war, than into it. War also is a simple and overt declaration. Peace attended with intricate and secret negotiations.'' 
   What about George Mason? 
   ``Mr. Mason was against giving the power of war to the Executive, because not safely to be trusted with it; or to the Senate, because not so constructed as to be entitled to it. He was for clogging rather than facilitating war; but for facilitating peace. He preferred `declare' to `make.' 
   ``On the motion to insert declare - - in place of make, it was agreed to.'' 
   Louis Fisher comments on the reaction taken at the Philadelphia Convention: ``The Framers empowered the President to repel sudden attacks in an emergency when Congress was not in session. That power covered attacks against the mainland of the United States and on the seas. The President never received a general power to deploy troops whenever and wherever he thought best. When Congress came back in session, it could reassert whatever control on military activity it considered necessary. 
   James Wilson expressed the prevailing sentiment that the system of checks and balances ``will not hurry us into war; it is calculated to guard against it. It will not be in the power of a single man, or a single body of men, to involve us in such distress; for the important power of declaring war is vested in the legislature at large.'' 
   Madison insisted that the Constitutional liberties could be preserved only by reserving the power 
   of war to Congress. Madison stated: ``Those who are to conduct a war cannot in the nature of things, be proper or safe judges, whether a war ought to be commenced, continued, or concluded. They are barred from the latter functions by a great principle in free government, analogous to that which separate the sword from the purse, or the power of executing from the power of enacting laws.'' 
   When Jefferson saw the draft Constitution, he praised the decision to transfer the war power ``from the executive to the Legislative body, from those who are to spend to those who are to pay.'' The Administration, and all Senators who may be prone to advocate an all-powerful executive, should take note. 
   I have already referred to General Clark's letter, to which our attention was called by Senator LEVIN last week. That letter brings to mind another letter to which I shall refer. Presidents, of course, are in a position to deploy forces in military environments before Congress has a chance to deliberate and decide what policies should be followed, and Presidents often do that. The potential for engaging the country in war was demonstrated by President Polk's actions in 1846, when he ordered General Zachary Taylor to occupy disputed territory on the Texas-Mexico border. His initiative provoked a clash between American and Mexican soldiers, allowing Polk to tell Congress a few weeks later that ``war exists.'' Although Congress formally declared war on Mexico, Polk's actions were censured in 1848 by the House of Representatives because the war had been ``unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by the President of the United States.'' One of the members of the House of Representatives who voted against Polk was Representative Abraham Lincoln, who later wrote to William H. Herndon: 
   Much ado has been made of General Clark's letter to Senator LEVIN. Let's read Abraham Lincoln's letter to William H. Herndon:  
   Allow the President to invade a neighboring nation, whenever he shall deem it necessary to repel an invasion, and you allow him to do so, whenever he may choose to say he deems it necessary for such purpose--and you allow him to make war at pleasure. Study to see if you can fix any limit to his power in this respect, after you have given him so much as you propose. If, today, he should choose to say he thinks it necessary to invade Canada, to prevent the British from invading us, how could you stop him? You may say to him, ``I see no probability of the British invading us'' but he will say to you ``be silent; I see it, if you don't.'' The provision of the Constitution giving the war-making power to Congress, was dictated, as I understand it, by the following reasons. Kings had always been involving and impoverishing their people in wars, pretending generally, if not always, that the good of the people was the object. This, our Convention understood to be the most oppressive of all Kingly oppressions; and they resolved to so frame the Constitution that no one man should hold the power of bringing this oppression upon us.  
   I wonder what Lincoln's advice would be to us today as we reflect upon the Administration's actions in Kosovo? Now that Congress has spent many months of complacent quietude before mounting a challenge to the Administration's continued usurpation of Congress' share in the war powers, we learn that the Administration fiercely opposes the Byrd-Warner Amendment. Why so? Is it too much to ask of the Administration that it come up with an exit strategy over the next year? Is it too much to ask of the Administration that it develop plans, in consultation with our NATO allies, for an orderly transition to an all-European ground troop element in Kosovo? Is it too much to ask that, if there is a necessity for the continued deployment of U.S. ground troops in Kosovo after July 1, 2001--or October 1, 2001 which we hope to make the date and will make it in conference--the President must request specific authorization for such continued deployment of U.S. ground combat troops in Kosovo, and that Congress must enact a joint resolution specifically authorizing the continued deployment of United States ground combat troops in Kosovo? 
   Is it too much to ask that the peoples Representative--people out there, their Representatives--be allowed to speak? What is wrong with that? Why is the Administration so suddenly very hysterical about this amendment? Very hysterical? They are panic stricken. They sent their big guns to Congress. They have even sent General Clark up to address the Democratic conference. What business does he have in the Democratic conference? Here we have in this Constitution, we have civilian control over the military, but here we find General Clark in the Democratic conference, trying to tell Senators what the intent of the Byrd-Warner amendment is, trying to tell Members of Congress what their constitutional duty in this institution is. 
   Does the Administration believe that the possible justification for the continued deployment of U.S. ground combat troops in Kosovo after July 1 of next year would be so weak that the Administration dare not face the risk of a vote by Congress in this regard? 
   I say to my colleagues in the Senate: Each of us has taken an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States and we take that oath because this Constitution requires Senators and Members of the House of Representatives to take that oath. Now is the time to live up to that oath. We must insist that the war powers that devolve upon Congress, under the Constitution, be preserved and protected against usurpation by this or any other administration. Nobody is talking about a declaration of war in references made to the powers and responsibilities of Congress in this situation. Nonetheless, any careful reading of the Constitution should make it as clear as the noonday sun in a cloudless sky that when American combat troops are deployed in a foreign country under circumstances where the lives of those troops are put in jeopardy by possible combat in a potential battlefield situation, the Congress is not required to remain silent. Remaining silent can become a habit. Congress can sleep on its rights until it can no longer claim those rights. And let us remember that it is also the people's rights on which we sleep. 
   As the late Justice of the Supreme Court, George Sutherland said in Associated Press vs. NRIB:  
   For the saddest epitaph which can be carved in memory of a vanished liberty is that it was lost because its possessors failed to stretch forth a saving hand while yet there was time.  
   The supporters of the Byrd-Warner amendment are stretching forth a saving hand while yet there is time. I hope that all Senators will take this occasion to assert the rights and powers of the legislative branch to which you belong, to which I belong, in respect to the conduct and use of the American military while there is yet time. If we allow the continued encroachment of these powers, which were meant by the Framers to be shared by the legislative  branch, future generations of Americans will not rise up and call us blessed. 
   Whether the next President comes up with a strategy to turn the ground troop element of the Kosovo peacekeeping operation entirely over to the Europeans, or whether Congress authorizes the continued deployment of U.S. ground troops in Kosovo, we will have taken affirmative action. We will have protected the people's rights--the people's rights--and exercised our responsibilities under the Constitution. We will have done our duty, as we have all solemnly sworn before God and man to do. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

   Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan says this vote is not about power. 
   I say to the distinguished Senator that this matter is about power. It is about the arrogance of power in a White House that insists on putting our men and our women in harm's way, and spending their tax dollars without the consent of their elected representatives. 
   Where is the wisdom in that course? Where is the wisdom in allowing a policy of indefinite drift in the Balkans with no end strategy, no exit strategy, and no clearly defined goals? 
   We keep hearing it said that we are endangering our men and women. I say we are endangering the lives of our men and women in the military by failing to make the case up front for putting them in harm's way. We are endangering the lives of our men and women in the military when we neglect to be sure that the American people support taking those risks before we put those men and women in harm's way. We are endangering the lives of our men and women in the military when we budget for dangerous missions in emergency bills after the fact that cannot provide for a long-term investment in those missions. We are endangering the lives of our men and women in the military when we have no clear-cut achievable goals and when we have no exit strategy. No ground has been  plowed for this mission, with no explanation of our goals and objectives, except some vague nebulous shibboleths. 
   Let me say this in closing. We are hearing from everybody but the people who pay the bills; the people who send their sons and daughters off to foreign lands to shed their blood. We hear from General Clark. We hear from the Secretary General of the United Nations. We hear from Secretary Cohen. We hear from everybody but the people. 
   I know what it is. I have been in Congress 48 years. I have seen a lot of these things happen before. 
   When we come here we have our picture taken with the Commander in Chief. My first picture that was taken after I came to Congress 48 years ago was with General Eisenhower, President Eisenhower. We go down to the White House. We get wined and dined. We have pictures taken with the brass over at the Pentagon. And we hear the people who live in the white towers, the political pundits, the media, and we forget about the people who send us here. We get all swollen up by virtue of these contacts that we have, and the people who are telling us what they think, the so-called commanders in chief, Presidents of the United States, and so on. We forget about the people, and we forget about the Constitution. 
   They may say this Constitution was all right for yesterday. They may say it is old, that it was all right 200 years ago, or that it was all right 100 years ago. 
   I say to you, my colleagues, if it were not for this Constitution, you wouldn't be here. There wouldn't be a Senate of the United States. There wouldn't be a Senate in which the small States of the Union have the same voice that the largest States have in this Union if it were not for this Constitution. If it were not for this Constitution, we wouldn't have the United States of America. We would probably have a ``Balkanized States of America.'' 
   So let's remember this Constitution. We take an oath to support and defend this Constitution. 
   That is what Senator WARNER and I and the supporters of this amendment are trying to do. We believe that the main warpowers are concentrated in the Congress, and that the main 
   absolute top warpower, the power of appropriating the money, is vested here. 
   Let's stop listening to these dreamings of distempered fancies--by the great generals, the Secretaries General, Defense Secretaries, and Presidents of the United States. Let's listen to the people of the United States. What do they think? They send their men and women to foreign fields to shed their blood. The people of the United States, the people who are listening in through that electronic eye up there, are the people we should be talking about. They are the people whom we should be listening to--not some far away Secretary General, not some Secretary of Defense, not some Commander in Chief. They are only here for a day, or for a term, or 4 years. But the people are out there yesterday, today, and forever. And we are their elected representatives. 
   Let's regain our voices and no longer be standing in awe of someone who wears the title of Commander in Chief. He is here only temporarily. He will be gone in a short time. There will be a new Commander in Chief. What does he think? We want to give the new Commander in Chief a voice. 
   Oh, they say: Why not vote today? That would be highly irresponsible. Vote today to take them out is not what Senator WARNER and I are saying. We are not saying take them out. We are not saying take them out today. We are not saying take them out tomorrow. We are saying, lay down a plan in consultation with the allies, whereby in due time the allies will take over the ground troop responsibility. We will leave our air support. We will leave our intelligence support. 
   But let's regain our senses here. Let's just try to remind ourselves that we are not here to represent the Commander in Chief. I am not. I am not here to represent a Commander in Chief. I am here to represent the people of West Virginia. I am not here to represent the Secretary General of NATO. I am not here to represent the Secretary of Defense. I respect these people. I respect them. But they cannot tell me what this Constitution means. They cannot tell me what the intent of the Constitution is. I have my own eyes. I have my own ears. I have my own conscience, and I will be driven by my conscience and by this Constitution as long as I stay here. 
   May God continue to bless this country--one nation, one Constitution, one destiny. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by Senator DASCHLE to S. 2521. I have come to the floor of the Senate several times to speak about failure of the Juvenile Justice conference to come to an agreement. Our nation is yearning for leadership. I vote for this amendment to once again urge the conferees to move ahead on the Juvenile Justice bill. Craft a common sense bill that will help to break this cycle of youth violence. Show the nation that the Congress can see what is happening outside of the Capitol Building, and that we are capable of working in partnership with all Americans to bring some calm to our classrooms. 
   This legislation does not create dramatic infringements on the right of an informed and responsible citizenry to keep and bear arms. It simply would put in place some common sense provisions to balance public safety and private gun owners' rights. Requiring trigger locks would not jeopardize anyone's Second Amendment rights to own a gun, but trigger locks might prevent children from turning guns on other children. And improving background checks is not a monumental change, either. These additional checks would only serve to prevent those people who should not have access to weapons from getting them. I believe that responsible parents and gun owners would be able to support these common sense provisions. 
   I also support the amendment offered by Senator LOTT to S. 2521. I agree that the government can and should do more to enforce the existing laws concerning firearms. I do not believe that we must choose between enacting common sense measures to protect public safety and protecting the rights of gun owners--we can do both. Nor do I believe that we must choose between enacting additional protections for public safety and enforcement of current gun laws. I hope that the conferees working on the Juvenile Justice bill will come to an agreement on legislation that will enhance enforcement of the laws we currently have on the books to keep guns out of the wrong hands. Further delay only increases the chance that another child may die from gun violence before the Congress acts.

Out of respect for those who are concerned about that certification process, and in an effort to improve the legislative product, Senator WARNER and I have discussed this 
   matter, and we are willing to reduce the numbers set forth in the certification language. We think that would improve the product and would also meet the concerns of Senators who have raised them.

   Mr. BYRD. I think I stated that earlier. 
   May I say to the distinguished Senator, I will try to answer his question. First, I say to the Senator, if he will yield, he has framed it this way: We are out unless we vote to stay in; come next--we hope to make that October 1 in conference; in the bill, it is announced July 1, 2001. We will not let the Senate frame it that way: ``We are out unless we vote to stay in.'' This bill does not say that. This amendment does not say that. 
   The Senator from Delaware, I say most respectfully, is leaving out one very important factor, that being the President of the United States, whoever he may be next October. The opponents of my amendment depend heavily upon the ``Commander in Chief.'' Well, there will be a Commander in Chief at that time, and that Commander in Chief, unless he makes a case, unless he asks to be authorized to continue to deploy American ground troops after that date, and unless Congress then votes to authorize, then they would leave. 
   But the Senator says, ``We are out unless we vote to stay in.'' That is not the case. There is going to be a President there asking. I assume, if he believes we ought to continue to deploy troops after that date, he will be up here asking. He will be requesting them. And then Congress will vote to authorize or not to authorize. It is not that simple, ``We are out unless we vote to stay in.''

   Mr. BYRD. He asked a question, Why don't we vote now? I have the answer to that. It would be irresponsible to vote now to take the troops out. My colleague, Senator WARNER, and I are not saying take the troops out. We are not saying we should withdraw the troops. Certainly, we would not say vote now to take the troops out. That would be very irresponsible. 
   What we are trying to do is establish an orderly procedure, over a period of more than a year from now, at which time the President, the new President, be it Mr. GORE or be it Mr. Bush, can come to the Congress and ask for authorization to continue the deployment of American troops, if he can make the case, if there is justification for it. 
   There are those of us in the Senate today who are supporting this amendment who, if that case is made, if a good case is made, a persuasive case is made--I do not assume I would vote against it. I might vote for it. But we are trying to lay down an orderly process whereby there will be plenty of time. 
   What we are trying to do is take back the authorities of the Congress which have been usurped by the administration. We have slept on our rights. I do not blame the administration; I blame the Congress. We have slept on our rights. So we are not saying take the troops out. But we do think it would be the wrong thing to attempt to vote to take the troops out now. We don't say that. We do not even say take the troops out, period. We are saying let the next President justify the case for leaving them in after a certain date, if that be the circumstance. 
   Mr. President, it has become startlingly clear over the past several days that the Clinton administration fiercely opposes the Byrd-Warner Amendment. Why does the administration fiercely oppose this amendment? The amendment does not mandate the withdrawal of U.S. ground combat troops from Kosovo. The amendment does not micromanage the Pentagon or the State Department. What is the administration afraid of? The intent of the Byrd-Warner Amendment is to restore congressional oversight to the Kosovo peacekeeping operation. Congress should have taken this step long ago, but by not doing so, Congress has allowed, by its own inaction, the administration to usurp the Constitutional authority of Congress in this matter. 
   The administration would much prefer that Congress not interfere at this late date with the continued usurpation of Congress' Constitutional prerogative and authority. No, the administration would much prefer Congress to keep quiet, roll over, play dead, or pretend to play dead, while the administration continues to do whatever it wants to do in Kosovo, run up the costs of the operation, prepare for a long-term stay there, and then send the bills to Congress for payment. 
   The position of the administration has been articulated most fervently by General Wesley Clark, the former Supreme Allied Commander of NATO troops in Europe. In a letter to Senator LEVIN, and in several meetings with Senators this week, General Clark repeatedly made the argument that the Byrd-Warner amendment would undermine the confidence that our European allies place in the U.S. commitment to NATO. Ha-ha, listen to that. How ridiculous that the Byrd-Warner amendment would undermine the confidence that our European allies place in the U.S. commitment to NATO. In less than two weeks, we will celebrate Memorial Day. We will remember, and honor, the 4,743,826 men who served in World War I. We will mark the loss of the 53,513 men who lost their lives in battle during that war, and the 63,195 uniformed men who also died, though not in battle. We will honor the 204,002 men who were wounded in that conflict, whose blood was spilled in those muddy trenches and across those snowy hills. 
   We will also pay tribute to the 16,353,659 men who put on a uniform and served during World War II, a conflict that also started in Europe. Some 292,131 of those 16 million men died--died in battle during that bloody war, and another 115,185 died while serving in that war. Another 671,876 were wounded in all theaters. American blood has soaked European ground--the ground cries out--and saved European lives. Then to say that the passage of this amendment would cause the Europeans to lose trust in the Americans--how silly, how perfectly ridiculous that that would be said. 
   That is the U.S. commitment to NATO, and to our European allies. Our commitment lies under European sod, under poppy-covered fields marked with endless rows of white crosses. Our blood is our bond. What more cane they ask? It is preposterous for General Clark or the administration to suggest that the Byrd-Warner amendment could undermine that bond. How silly, how utterly ridiculous. 
   Asking our European allies to meet their commitments in Kosovo, while we continue to shoulder the burden of intelligence collection, transportation, and other critical support roles for which we are uniquely equipped, is not walking away from NATO. It is not walking away from Europe. The Byrd-Warner amendment assumes that the administration can come up with a supportable case for continued U.S. involvement in Kosovo if necessary. 
   It might be Mr. GORE. It might be Mr. Bush. But we assume that they can come up with a justifiable case if they think they have a case. 
   The Byrd-Warner amendment does not assume that the United States will withdraw from Kosovo. We do not assume that at all. That is simply the logical conclusion of but one path this debate might take. The other path is that the administration will present, and defend, a plan--whatever administration it is--by next year for continued U.S. involvement in Kosovo that the Congress and the American people can support. We assume they can. But let them do it. Then our troops, our military establishment, our allies, and others in the region, will understand the depth of support for this mission in the United States. 
   One of the primary aims of the Byrd-Warner provision is to get the administration and the next administration, be  it Democratic or Republican, to focus on a policy. 
   I have asked this administration for an exit strategy. I cannot get an answer. I have asked for a rough estimate, within 2 years, of how long we expect ground troops to remain in Kosovo. I cannot get an answer. I have asked this administration for an estimate of the ultimate cost of this operation to the American taxpayer. I cannot get an answer. 
   As far as I can tell, we are on mission ``Ad Hoc'' in Kosovo, with nobody in the entire executive branch in Washington or elsewhere, able to give this Senator and the American people answers to the most basic questions regarding the scope, costs or foreseeable end of the mission. 
   I cannot even get anyone to tell me how we will know when it is time to leave? How will we know when it is time to leave? 
   Talk about open ended commitments! This endeavor does not even have walls, much less ceilings or floors. 
   Now we are being told by the Office of Management and Budget that the administration cannot provide assurances that the certification of allied effort required by the Byrd-Warner amendment will be met by the due date of July 15. The problem? I quote from the statement of administration policy. Here is the problem: ``mechanical formulas and recordkeeping technicalities.'' I realize that this administration has had its share of recordkeeping problems, but I find it difficult to believe they cannot do the simple arithmetic--the old math or the new math--this provision requires. 
   The administration itself acknowledges that the allies are already exceeding their commitments for humanitarian assistance and for the Kosovo consolidated budget. Further, according to the administration's reckoning, the allies have already deployed 63 percent of the civilian police that they have promised. No, they have not yet met the 75 percent benchmark, but Spain is expected to deploy 115 additional police in June, and great Britain recently announced that it will deploy an additional 57 police by the end of May, which would boost the total to over 75 percent. 
   Given the allies' poor track record in the area, I think we should hold their feet to the fire on the 75 percent standard. It is achievable. If the allies balk at coming up with 158 additional policemen, Congress and the American people should know and should know the reason why. And we should know the reason before we pay out the final installment of the $2 billion in military costs funded in this bill that the U.S. has incurred in Kosovo this year. 
   The administration also contends that the allies will not be able to come up with 33 percent of their promised reconstruction assistance. The changes that we intend to make to this provision--Senator STEVENS and I confer if we are not allowed to make them on the floor--will take care of that problem. We will drop that requirement to 25 percent. According to the National Security Council, which apparently can do the arithmetic, the allies are currently at 23.1 percent. I have every confidence that they can come up with the remaining 1.9 percent by July 15. Mr. President, the purpose of including the certification benchmarks in this provision was to give the United States leverage to demand that our allies live up to their commitments. Our intention is for these requirements to be used as a prod, not a battering ram. We want the allies to meet these requirements. But if for some reason they cannot, we have included a safety valve--a vote under expedited procedures to release the money being held in reserve to continue the deployment of U.S. forces in Kosovo. It is not now, nor was it ever, the intention of Senator WARNER or me to force a withdrawal of U.S. troops from Kosovo in July. 
   Our intention is very simple: To do right by the Constitution, to do right by the American people, and to do right by the men and women in uniform that we send into harm's way in operations like the one in Kosovo. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

We would merely withdraw the ground troops, but we would only withdraw them in the event the President did not ask for authorization to continue the deployment, and in the event he asked and Congress voted no. Otherwise, they will be there.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate Appropriations Committee today adopted, by a very strong bipartisan vote, an amendment authored by Senator WARNER and myself that addresses the ongoing role of United States participation in the Kosovo peacekeeping operation. Our amendment, which was attached to a Kosovo supplemental appropriations package, is cosponsored by Senator STEVENS and a number of other Senators on both the Appropriations and Armed Services Committees. 
   The Byrd-Warner amendment goes to the heart of the constitutional responsibility of Congress to address issues involving the deployment of U.S. military troops to politically unstable and potentially dangerous war-ravaged nations overseas. 
   I am troubled by the trend that has developed in recent years to de facto authorize military operations through appropriations bills without further congressional discussion or debate on the policy. Under this practice, the Executive Branch determines how and  where it will spend the money, and how much money it will spend, and then presents the bill to Congress. We saw it happen in Bosnia, in Haiti, in Somalia, and now it is happening in Kosovo. 
   Mr. President, I do not believe that such a back-door authorization process is what the founding fathers had in mind when they delegated to Congress alone the power of the purse. 
   By continuing to allow the Executive Branch to deploy U.S. troops overseas and merely send the bill to Congress later, Congress is effectively abrogating its responsibility under the Constitution and to the American people. 
   The Byrd-Warner amendment restores congressional oversight to the calculation. Our amendment cuts off funding for the continued deployment of U.S. ground combat troops in Kosovo after July 1, 2001, unless the President seeks and receives congressional authorization to continue such deployment. At the same time, the amendment requires the President to develop a plan to turn the Kosovo peacekeeping operation entirely over to our allies by July 1, 2001. 
   The amendment provides ample time and an orderly process for this President, and the next President, to either develop a plan to turn the ground troop element of the Kosovo peacekeeping operation entirely over to the Europeans, or to seek congressional authorization to keep United States ground troops in Kosovo. 
   As an interim step, the amendment withholds 25 percent of the Kosovo money included in the supplemental appropriations package pending certification by the President that America's allies are making adequate progress in meeting their monetary and personnel commitments to the Kosovo peacekeeping operation. The certification is due by July 15. If the President cannot make the certification, the funds held in reserve can only be used to withdraw United States troops from Kosovo unless Congress votes otherwise. 
   Mr. President, this is a reasoned and reasonable approach to dealing with foreign peacekeeping operations. Senator WARNER and I believe that it can be executed without major disruption to the NATO peacekeeping mission in Kosovo. We are not turning our backs on Kosovo. We are not attempting to micromanage the Pentagon. We are merely attempting to restore congressional oversight to the peacekeeping process. 
   When it comes to exercising its constitutional authority, Congress has been sleeping on its rights. This amendment is a long overdue wake-up call. I thank Senator WARNER for his work on the amendment, and for his unswerving dedication to the nation and to the Senate, and I look forward to continuing to work with him on this very important issue.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President: 
 God hath not promised Skies always blue Flower-strewn pathways All our lives through; God hath not promised Sun without rain, Joy without sorrow, Peace without pain. 
 But God hath promised Strength for the day, Rest for the laborer, And light on the way, Grace for the trials, Help from above, Unfailing sympathy And undying love.  
   Mr. President, I have quoted this bit of poetry because I am thinking of Mike Epstein, Senator WELLSTONE's long serving legislative director. Mike Epstein, I heard only yesterday, is gravely ill. I know that he is facing this news with the same gallant, noble, straightforward courage that has marked his entire life. I know because I employed him as a member of the Democratic Policy Committee staff when I was the majority leader of the Senate, and I have seen him in action. I have seen him at work many times. 
   Mike is a man of lively humor, great heart, idealistic vision, and pragmatic understanding. Despite many years on Capitol Hill, he has never lost his sense of purpose in public service. He has never lost his desire to make the world a better place in which to live. At the same time, he has accumulated the political savvy and acumen to rapidly size up a piece of legislation, weigh its strengths and weigh its weaknesses, and then deliver a succinct analysis on the spot. He has been a fixture on the Democratic bench during debate on many bills. 
   It seems it was only yesterday that I saw him back here on this bench. I always made it a point to speak to Mike as I went by. It may have been a week ago, it may have been 2 weeks ago, perhaps it was 3 weeks ago, but he was there. And, as I say, just like always, it was as though it was only a few hours ago. 
   He has shepherded a generation of inexperienced legislative assistants through the arcane minuet of amendment trees, tabling motions, and cloture votes. In this respect, as in so many others, Mike has been outstanding in his commitment to the Senate, to its traditions, and in giving one's best to the Nation. What more can one do? 
   The Senate is, in many ways, Mike's enduring passion. Legislation is his obsession. He was a ``policy wonk'' before that phrase was ever coined. His friends are legion in both parties, and outside the Senate as well as inside the Senate, and outside both parties as well. 
   Senator WELLSTONE and his staff are part of Mike's extended Senate family. I know that everyone is shocked, just as I was shocked yesterday, at this unexpected news and that all my colleagues join me in offering Mike strength and comfort. 
   It brings home the memory of that scriptural passage which says:  
   Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. 
   He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.  
   Seneca once observed that ``there is nothing in the world so much admired as a man who knows how to bear unhappiness with courage.'' As he bravely faces his toughest battle, Mike Epstein offers to each of us something further to admire and to cherish. 
   So tonight I shall go home, remembering Mike, sitting back there on that bench, looking at me, smiling. 
   I close with a short verse by Spencer Michael Free, 
   ``The Human Touch,'' which I believe best captures the warm and caring legacy of Mike Epstein's long and faithful service to the Senate:  
   'Tis the human touch in this world that counts, 
   The touch of your hand and mine, 
   Which means far more to the fainting heart 
   Than shelter and bread and wine; 
   For shelter is gone when the night is o'er, 
   And bread lasts only a day, 
   But the touch of the hand and the sound of the voice 
   Sing on in the soul alway[s].  
   Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have been asked by the two distinguished principal proponents, as I understand it, to allow the motion to proceed to be withdrawn by unanimous consent, after which I and others who are opposed to the constitutional amendment could proceed to make our speeches. 
   I am opposed to that procedure. I think that if we are going to call up constitutional amendments around here--and certainly Senators have a right to offer constitutional amendments--but if they are going to be called up, I think we ought to take the full time and discuss them, the full time allowed to us under the rules and discuss those amendments--pro and con--and not allow them to be withdrawn and then, afterwards make our speeches. 
   That does not make sense to this Senator. They have a perfect right--the proponents--to seek consent to have the amendments withdrawn. But I say, let's have a full discussion of them and then give consent to their being withdrawn. 
   I honor those proponents who have worked hard, especially the two principal ones, Mr. KYL of Arizona and Mrs. FEINSTEIN of California. They are very dedicated, very worthy, very formidable protagonists. I respect them and respect their viewpoints. They have as much right to disagree with me as I have with them. They certainly have the right to their viewpoints. I do not quarrel with that right at all. 
   Let me also say to the victims of crime, wherever they may be, if they be watching, listening or reading the congressional record of these statements, I certainly am not against victims' rights. I am sure I speak for all of those in this body who oppose this constitutional amendment. We are not against victims' rights. I am for victims' legitimate rights. As one who has been about as firm as any other Senator could be when it comes to dealing with criminals, as one who believes in capital punishment, as one who believes in the death penalty, as one who has seen a public execution, as one who believes in making the criminals pay, I certainly do not take a back seat to anyone when it comes to supporting legitimate victims' rights. I am for that. But I am not for this amendment to the Constitution of the United States. 
   I think victims' rights can be secured, are being secured, and will continue to have my support, when statutes are devised to protect those rights. But 
   when it comes to amending the Federal Constitution, that is something else. That is entirely another matter. We don't need to amend the Federal Constitution to secure victims rights. 
 I saw them tearing a building down, A group of men in a busy town; With a ``Ho, heave, ho'' and a lusty yell, They swung a beam and the sidewall fell. 
 I said to the foreman, ``Are these men skilled The type you'd hire if you had to build?'' He laughed, and then he said, ``No, indeed, Just common labor is all I need; I can easily wreck in a day or two, That which takes builders years to do.'' 
 I said to myself as I walked away, ``Which of these roles am I trying to play? Am I a builder who works with care, Building my life by the rule and square? Am I shaping my deeds by a well-laid plan, Patiently building the best I can? Or am I a wrecker who walks the town, Content with the labor of tearing down?''  
   That is the picture we have before us. We are talking about the higher law of our land, the Constitution of the United States of America. It was centuries in the making, but it can be trivialized in a day. 
   We are talking about the Federal Constitution, the Constitution of the United States of America, the Constitution that was signed by 39 delegates on September 17, 1787. 
   Listen to them: New Hampshire, Nicholas Gilman and John Langdon; Massachusetts, Nathaniel Gorham and Rufus King; Connecticut, Roger Sherman and William Samuel Johnson; New York, Alexander Hamilton; New Jersey, William Paterson, David Brearley, William Livingston, Jonathan Dayton; Pennsylvania, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Mifflin, Robert Morris, George Clymer, Jared Ingersoll, Thomas FitzSimons, Gouverneur Morris--the tall man with the peg leg--and James Wilson; Delaware, George Read, John Dickinson, Jacob Broom, Richard Bassett; Maryland, Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer, Daniel Carroll, James McHenry; Virginia, George Washington, John Blair, James Madison; North Carolina, William Blount, Richard Dobbs Spaight, Hugh Williamson; South Carolina, Charles Pinckney, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, John Rutledge, Pierce Butler; Georgia, William Few and Abraham Baldwin. 
   What would they think? What would they think of this amendment? Not what professor so-and-so of such-and-such university may think, but what would those framers of the Constitution say if they were here? 
   Most Americans can recall seeing the statue of ``Blind Justice'' holding aloft a balance scale in a courthouse or as a logo for a favorite TV crime show. It is an impressive and powerful representation with roots in Greek and Roman mythology. 
   The scale symbolizes the impartial weighing of evidence, while the blindfolded figure, the goddess Themis, symbolizes equal justice under the law for the accused. 
   But in a larger sense, the scale symbolizes something even more significant. It symbolizes competing interests--universal tensions, if you will--such as innocence versus guilt, truth versus falsehood, personal privacy versus the public welfare, the power of the State versus the rights of the individual. When those scales are put into equilibrium, they are said to be in balance, the right side weighed to be exactly at level with the left. 
   When it comes to human affairs, balance is a very difficult state to achieve. But once achieved, the sweet harmony of balance--one tension offset by just the right measure of the competing tension--allows for the calmest, most rational functioning of man's institutions of order. 
   Nowhere is the example of beautiful and near-perfect balance, despite competing and conflicting ambitions, goals, and passions more profoundly demonstrated than in that venerable charter, the U.S. Constitution, which I hold here in my right hand. 
   Our Constitution embodies the accommodation of such difficult-to-rectify aspirations as the National Government's need for supremacy and the individual State's need for autonomy. Our Constitution satisfies the States' desire to maintain order without trampling on the individual's right to enjoy liberty. Liberty. That is the key word. Liberty. Our Constitution bestows power on the institutions and offices of Government in such a way as to allow them to adequately carry out their duties and yet be curbed and checked by the duties and responsibilities of other officials and institutions. Such is the brilliance and the genius of our national charter that it has been amended only 27 times in our more than 200-year history. Ten of those 27 amendments, of course, comprise the Bill of Rights, leaving only 17 amendments in these 212 years. Seventeen amendments. 
   One of those--the prohibition amendment of 1919--was repealed, wiped out--that was the 18th amendment; it was wiped out by the 21st amendment. So take one away--the 18th amendment--and that leaves only 16 amendments.  
   One might say: How about the 21st amendment, which wiped it out? Don't subtract that one because there is a portion of that amendment that is still in the Constitution, and it will remain there until such time as it may be repealed. But you might say there are 16 amendments. Over 11,000 amendments to the Constitution have been introduced in both Houses. 
   The men who created this amazing--and it is amazing. One may read Shakespeare and one may read the Bible time and time and time again, and each time one reads that Holy Writ, he or she will find something new--every time. But think of this truly amazing, durable Constitution. It is a durable crucible for liberty. The men who created this durable, amazing, wonderful crucible for liberty were students of history and students of various methods of governing going back, back, back, back, back into the misty centuries of antiquity, long before 1787. They were students of the philosophies of the various methods of government. These men who wrote the Constitution came fresh from the mistakes of the experience of the Articles of Confederation, the first Constitution of the United States. They lived under the Articles of Confederation; they knew what the flaws of the Articles were. They knew where they fell short. They knew where those provisions were lacking. The memory of the Revolutionary War and the bloodshed in that struggle for freedom were at the forefront of their minds. They--the framers--God bless their names--bequeathed to me, to us, something very profound--something strong, yet something also quite delicate. Over the years, I have come to believe that we should tinker with their magnificent work only very, very rarely. 
   Each Member of this body takes an oath when he or she becomes a U.S. Senator, and there have only been 1852 men and women who have taken that oath to be Members of this great body. Think--just think--for a moment about that oath. Think about the words: ``Support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.'' Then think, if you will, about the extreme difficulty of the procedure laid out in that same Constitution for changing that Constitution in any way. I do believe that the framers were quite wary of injudicious disruptions to, and even the meddling, piddling, tinkering, and tampering with the careful balance that they had so laboriously achieved. 
   As in most things, they were only too right. 
   In the 106th Congress, as of April 17 of this year, there had been 63 constitutional amendments proposed--63 constitutional amounts proposed. The Senate has only been in session 43 or 45 days this year. In the 105th Congress, there were 107 constitutional amendments proposed. I think that it is clear the framers' fears were quite well founded. These amendments are proliferating at an unalarming level. 
   That is why I have taken the floor on yesterday, that is why I have taken it today, and that is why I shall take it, the Lord willing, time and time again in the days to come. 
   These amendments are proliferating at an alarming level. It seems that we are almost intent on disrupting what has served us and continues to serve us so well--the elegant wisdom and the very careful balance inherent in the Constitution. For the second time within 30 days, the U.S. Senate--that remarkable body which Gladstone, who had been Prime Minister of Britain four times, remarked about--``that remarkable body,'' the U.S. Senate, ``the most remarkable of all of the inventions of modern politics,'' the U.S. Senate is being called upon to adopt an amendment to the U.S. Constitution. 
   It would be laughable if it weren't so serious. 
   Who are we to conjure up all of these myriad amendments to that great document? 
   So I say the Senate perhaps had better adopt a resolution designating April as ``Amend the Constitution Month.'' 
   Let's have at it. Let's have a resolution calling April, the fourth month of this year of our Lord, the year 2000, the last year in the 20th century, the last year in the second millennium. 
   Fie on the media, and fie on politicians who try to hand the American people all of this flimflam about this year's being the first year of the 21st century--this year's being the first year of a new century. Take the old math, take the new math, whatever math you want to take. It all comes out the same. 
   There are 100 years in every century, and 1,000 years in every millennium. We are today in the last year of the 20th century. 
   I was invited down to the White House a few days before the beginning of the new year. I don't go down very often. I don't get invited down as much as I used to, but it doesn't bother me. I went down when I was majority leader, when I was minority leader, and when I was majority leader again, and when I was President pro tempore of the Senate--all too much. I got tired of going down there. 
   I must say they were very kind to invite me down to what I think they called the New Millennium party. 
   I said to my fine staff person, you tell that nice lady that the new millennium hasn't begun yet, and it won't begin until the year 2001, January. 
   Now we have the latest constitutional amendment--something called the crime victims' rights constitutional amendment, with the Senate poised to consider it following, you guessed it, ``National Crime Victims' Rights Week,'' a week during which the Senate was in recess. 
   Does this suggest something to us? To me, it suggests a less than serious, dare I say somewhat frivolous, view of the gravity and far-reaching nature of constitutional amendments in general, and of this constitutional amendment in particular. 
   To those victims out there who are watching over that electronic eye, let me assure you again that I am for your legitimate rights. But I am not for adding an amendment to the Constitution. It isn't necessary. 
   The amendment which is being proposed is intended to restore and preserve--although I understand there were some negotiations going on with respect to this amendment as to how it might be changed and altered from what it is in the printed amendment upon the desks of Senators, negotiations going on with the White House, I understand. Why the White House? What do they have to do with it? The President of the United States doesn't sign a joint resolution that carries a constitutional amendment. That is a joint resolution that doesn't go to the President's desk. He can't veto it. He can't sign it. Why negotiate with him? 
   The amendment which is being proposed is intended to restore and preserve, ``as a matter of right for the victims of violent crimes, the practice of victim participation in the administration of criminal justice that was the birthright of every American at the founding of our Nation.'' 
   This is a very impressive goal for the amendment, and, if the matter only stopped there, undoubtedly it would enjoy the sympathy and the support of every Member of this body because who is there who would be opposed to the legitimate rights of victims of violent crime? The title and the substance of the measure are certainly worthy of consideration. 
   The Committee on the Judiciary recommended that victims' rights under nine general headings be protected in the amendment to the Federal Constitution. These nine rights are set forth as follows: (1) a right of victims to receive notice of criminal justice proceedings; (2) a right of victims to attend criminal justice proceedings related to crimes perpetrated against them; (3) a right of victims to be heard at five points in the criminal justice process, namely, plea bargains, bail or release hearings, sentencing, parole hearings, and pardon or commutation decisions; (4) a right of victims to notice of, and an opportunity to submit a statement concerning, a proposed pardon or commutation of sentence; (5) a right of victims to notice of release or escape of the accused;

   Mr. BYRD. The Contract On America. All right. Call it a Contract On America. 
   The minority also states that there is no need for more Federal court supervision and micromanagement of State and local affairs, when every State is already working hard to address the issues in ways that are best suited to its own citizens and its own criminal justice system. 
   There have been some 63 drafts of the proposed amendment, and it remains both excessively detailed and decidedly vague. The level of detail provided in this amendment is inconsistent with the structure and the style of our country's great governing document, and, indeed, the resolution reads like a statute, which suggests that that is, in fact, how the problem of protecting the rights of crime victims should be addressed. 
   The majority report cites examples of overwhelming popular support and demonstrates that change toward better implementation of victims' rights is occurring now, already, in the States. The majority admits that ``there is a trend''--the majority in this subcommittee report issued by the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. Senate--admits that ``there is a trend toward greater public involvement in the process, with the federal system and a number of states now providing notice to victims.'' Hence, it is my belief that we, here at the Federal legislative level, should avoid the adoption of a Federal constitutional amendment and that we should allow the States to continue to come up with innovations of their own without undue Federal intervention in a matter which, basically, is in the purview of the States. 
   Our illustrious friends who are the chief cosponsors of the amendment, very honorable Members of this body, one from the Democratic side and one from the Republican side, have told us that they will be back. ``We'll be back,'' they say. 
   In the meantime, I hope we can educate ourselves a little better with respect to the constitutional principles that we are here to defend and to protect. I hope that during this interim, while they are preparing to come back, that we will be educating ourselves a bit further and helping to educate others as to the history of American constitutionalism so that Senators, in the future, may be a little better prepared to take on this new amendment when it is brought back before the Senate, as we are assured that it will be. 
   I have heard, during this debate, that you can include these victims' rights in statutes, but they won't be enforced. Some of them are already in statutes, but they are not being enforced. That is what we heard the proponents say. They are not being enforced. They won't be enforced. They are in the laws of various States, but they are not being enforced so what we need is a constitutional amendment. How about that? How can be assured that a constitutional amendment will be enforced? 
   Let's return to the Book our fathers read:  
   19 There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day: 
   20 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores. 
   21 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. 
   22 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried; 
   23 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. 
   24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. 
   25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. 
   26 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence. 
   27 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house: 
   28 For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment. 
   29 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. 
   30 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent. 
   31 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.  
   That is the lesson. If the people in the States will not be persuaded by the statutes of the States that are already on the books, if they cannot be enforced, then will they listen to Moses and the prophets even if they rose from the dead? Will they hear even if it is a Federal constitutional amendment? 
   Why should we think they will hear better, that they will see better, that they will honor more, that they will abide more by words that are written into the Federal Constitution than they will those words that are already written in the statute books of the States and the Federal statutes as well? If they will not hear them, they will not hear Moses and the prophets, even though they were brought from the dead. 
   If they will not abide by the statutes, if they will not enforce them, what is there to ensure us that they would enforce the strictures of a new constitutional amendment? And if they did not, what would we be doing to the Federal Constitution? We would trivialize it; we would minimize it; we would lower it in the estimation of the people. 
   When it comes to amending the highest law in our constitutional system, it behooves us to step back and behold the forest, not just the trees. 
   Once before in our history we amended the Constitution without carefully thinking through the consequences. That was when the 18th amendment, dealing with prohibition, was ratified on January 16, 1919. 
   I can remember as a boy seeing those revenue officers come around to the coal company houses. I can see them climbing the hills of the coal mining community going to various houses, going into the woods, looking for the moonshine stills. Those were the revenuers, as they used to say--the revenuers. That was under prohibition. That amendment opened a Pandora's box, or as Senator JEFF BINGAMAN says, a box of Pandoras. That amendment opened a Pandora's box of unintended and unforeseen consequences, and it was not until almost 15 years later that the 21st amendment repealing the 18th amendment was ratified on December 5, 1933. It took a long time to get the genie back into the bottle, and we should have learned a lesson from that experience. 
   As a principle of simple prudence, we should be ever cautious about amending the organic law of our Nation. Justice Cardozo was explicit in his warning, uttered in the case of Browne v. City of New York, and we should heed that warning. Here it is:  
   The integrity of the basic law is to be preserved against hasty or ill-considered changes, the fruit of ignorance or passion.  
   Mr. President, the Constitution itself in article V, the article that provides for amendments to the Constitution, carries such an implication. Here is what it says--listen carefully--as an implication against hasty or ill-considered changes:  
   The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to this Constitution,......  
   There is the warning, ``whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary.'' The word ``necessary'' is not just a throwaway word that was just inserted to fill up space in article V of the U.S. Constitution. We can be sure that the constitutional framers chose the word carefully, as they did 
   all other words in that unique document.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the able senior Senator from Vermont for his overly charitable words concerning me. I thank him for his steadfast support on the Constitution. I thank him for the positions he has taken on many occasions during the years we have served together--positions that were in the best interest of the Constitution, best interest of this institution, and in the best interest of our country. 
   I join with the Senator in recalling the new profile in courage that was established by our former colleague, Senator Hatfield. He stood as a rock under the pressures of colleagues. Those were difficult pressures, in the party conference. He was threatened with his position as chairman of the Appropriations Committee. That took courage. And he had it. He had the real stuff. I hope he is listening today. We don't forget men such as Mr. Hatfield. 
   Again, I thank my friend; he is my friend, and I think of him as my friend. He is a very generous person, a person whom I would think of as a Good Samaritan in this journey of life. 
   I thank him for his work here. He will be here, he will be, long after the good Lord has taken me away. But he will be there holding the torch, holding the Constitution, holding up this institution. And there will by others, and I hope there will be more, day by day. 
   I thank the Senator, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have listened to the comments by my colleagues, those who are proponents of the proposed constitutional amendment before the Senate, and I have listened to the comments of many of my colleagues who have spoken in opposition to the proposed amendment. I compliment both sides on the debate. I think it is an enlightening debate. 
   I will have more to say if the motion to proceed is agreed to. 
   In view of the statements that have been made by several of those who are opposed to the amendment--the Senator from New York (Mr. SCHUMER), the Senator from Illinois (Mr. DURBIN), and the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. DODD), and others, they have cogently and succinctly expressed my sentiments in opposition to the amendment. 
   I congratulate the Senator from Vermont, Mr. LEAHY, on his statements in opposition thereto, as well as the leadership he has demonstrated not only on this proposed constitutional amendment but also in reference to other constitutional amendments before the Senate in recent days and in years past. He is a dedicated Senator in every respect. He certainly is dedicated to this Federal Constitution and very ably defends the Constitution. 
   I do not say that our Constitution is static. John Marshall said it was a Constitution that was meant for the ages. I will go into that more deeply later. At a later date, I will address this particular amendment. 
   But having been a Member of the Congress now going on 48 years, I may not be an expert on the Constitution, but I have become an expert observer of what is happening in this Congress and its predecessor Congresses, and an observer of what is happening by way of the Constitution. I consider myself to be as much an expert in that regard as anybody living because I have been around longer than most people. I have now been a Member of Congress, including both Houses, longer than any other Member of the 535 Members of Congress today. 
   I must say that I am very concerned about the cavalierness which I have observed with respect to the offering of constitutional amendments. There seems to be a cavalier spirit abroad which seems to say that if it is good politically, if it sounds good politically, if it looks good politically, if it will get votes, let's introduce an amendment to the Constitution. I am not saying that with respect to proponents of this amendment, but, in my own judgment, I have seen a lot of that going on. 
   I don't think there is, generally speaking, a clear understanding and appreciation of American constitutionalism. I don't think there is an understanding of where the roots of this Constitution go. I don't think there is an appreciation for the fact that the roots of this Constitution go 1,000 years or more back into antiquity. I do not address this proposed constitutional amendment as something that is necessary, nor do I address this, the Constitution today, as something that just goes back to the year 1787, 212 years ago. 
   The Constitution was written by men who had ample experience, who benefited by their experience as former Governors, as former members of their State legislatures, as former members of the colonial legislatures which preceded the State legislatures, as former Members of the Continental Congress which began in 1794, as Members of the Congress under the Articles of Confederation which became effective in 1781. Some of the members of the convention came from England, from Scotland, from Ireland. Alexander Hamilton was born in the West Indies. These men were very well acquainted with the experiences of the colonialists. They were very much aware of the weaknesses, the flaws in the Articles of Confederation. They understood the State constitutions. Most of the 13 State constitutions were written in the years 1776 and 1777. Many of the men who sat in the Constitutional Convention of 1787 had helped to create those State constitutions of 1776 and 1777 and subsequent thereto. Many of them had experience on the bench. They had experiences in dealing with Great Britain during and prior to the American Revolution. Some of them had fought in Gen. George Washington's polyglot, motley army. These men came with great experience. Franklin was 81 years  old. Hamilton was 30. The tall man with the peg leg, Gouverneur Morris, was 35. Madison was 36. They were young in years, but they had tremendous experience back of those years. 
   So the Constitution carries with it the lessons of the experiences of the men who wrote it. They were steeped in the classics. They were steeped in ancient history. They knew about Polybius. They knew how he wrote about mixed government. They knew what Herodotus had to say about mixed government. They knew what other great Greek and Roman authors of history had learned by experience, centuries before the 18th century. They knew about the oppression of tyrannical English monarchs. They knew the importance of the English Constitution, of the Magna Carta, of the English Bill of Rights in 1689. They knew about the English Petition of Right in 1628. All of these were parts of the English Constitution, an unwritten Constitution except for those documents, some of which I have named--the Petition of Right, the Magna Carta, the decisions of English courts, and English statutes. 
   So to stand here and say, in essence, that the Constitution reflects the viewpoints of the men who wrote that Constitution in 1787, or only reflects the views of our American predecessors of 1789, or those who ratified the Constitution in 1790 or in 1791, is only a partial truth. The roots of this Constitution--a copy of which I hold in my hand--go back 1,000 years, long before 1787, long before 1791 when the first 10 amendments which constitute the American Bill of Rights were ratified. That was only a milestone along the way--1787, 1791. These were mere milestones along the way to the real truths, the real values that are in this Constitution, a copy of which I hold in my hand. Those are only milestones along the way, 
   far beyond 1787, far beyond 1776 or 1775 or 1774. Why was that revolution fought? Why did our forbears take stand there on the field of Lexington, on April 19, and shed their blood? Why was that revolution fought? It was fought on behalf of liberty. That is what this Constitution is all about--liberty, the rights of a free people, the liberties of a free people. Liberty, freedom from oppression, freedom from oppressive government, that is why they shed their blood at Lexington and at Bunker Hill and at Kings Mountain and at Valley Forge, down through the decades and the centuries. The blood of Englishmen was spilled centuries earlier in the interests of liberty, in the interests of freedom: Freedom of the press, freedom to speak, freedom to stand on their feet in Parliament and speak out against the King, freedom from the oppression of the heavy hand of government. That is what that Constitution is about. 
   There are those who think that the Constitution sprang from the great minds of those 39 men who signed the Constitution at the Convention, of the 55 who attended the meetings of the Convention--some believe that it sprang from their minds right on the spot. Some believe that it came, like manna from Heaven, fell into their arms. It sprang like Minerva from the brain of Jove. That is what they think. 
   No, I say a miracle happened at Philadelphia, but that was not the miracle. The miracle that occurred at Philadelphia was the miracle that these minds of illustrious men gathered at a given point in time, at Philadelphia, and over a period of 116 days wrote this Constitution. It could not have happened 5 years earlier because they were not ready for it. Their experiences of living under the Articles of Confederation had not yet ripened to a point where they were ready to accept the fact that there had to be a new government, a new constitution written. And it could not have happened 5 years later because the violence that they saw in France, as the guillotine claimed life after life after life, had not yet happened. Some 5 years later, they would have seen that violence of the French Revolution, and they would have recoiled in horror from it. 
   The writing of this Constitution happened at the right time, at the right place, and it was written by the right men. That was the miracle of Philadelphia. 
   Here we are today talking about amending it, this great document, the greatest document of its kind that was ever written in the history of the world. There is nothing to compare it with, by way of man-made documents. Who would attempt to amend the Ten Commandments that were handed down to Moses? Not I. Yet, we, little pygmies on this great stage, before the world, would attempt to pit our talents and our wisdom against the talents and wisdom, the experience and the viewpoints of men such as George Washington, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, Gouverneur Morris, Benjamin Franklin, John Dickenson, James Wilson, Roger Sherman? In article V of this Constitution, they had the foresight to write the standard. If we want to find the standard for this Constitutional amendment, or any other Constitutional amendment here is the standard in the Constitution itself.  
   The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary--  
   The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary--  
   shall propose Amendments....... 
   I don't say that the Constitution is static. I don't say it never should be amended. I would vote for a constitutional amendment if I deemed it ``necessary.'' Certainly, I do not see this proposed amendment as necessary, but I will have more to say about that later. 
   I don't say that the Constitution is perfect. I do say that there is no other comparable document in the world that has ever been created by man. And when that Constitution uses the word ``necessary,'' it means ``necessary,'' because no word in that Constitution was just put into that document as a place filler. 
   I do think this is a time that I might speak a little about the constitutionalism behind the American Constitution. I think it might be well for anyone who might be patient enough or interested enough, to hear what I am going to say, because I don't think enough people understand the Constitution. I am sure they don't understand the roots of the Constitution. They don't understand American constitutionalism. It is a unique constitutionalism, the American constitutionalism. I don't think most people understand it. 
   In response to a recent nationwide poll, 91 percent of the respondents agreed with this statement: ``The U.S. Constitution is important to me.'' 
   Mr. President, 91 percent of the respondents agreed to that: ``The U.S. Constitution is important to me.'' Yet only 19 percent of the people polled knew that the Constitution was written in 1787; only 66 percent recognized the first 10 amendments to the Constitution as the Bill of Rights--only 66 percent. Only 58 percent answered correctly that there were three branches of the Federal Government; 17 percent were able to recall that freedom of assembly is guaranteed by the first amendment to the Constitution--17 percent, 17 percent. Yet you see them out here all the time, on the Capitol steps, assembling, petitioning the Government for a redress of what they conceive to be grievances. They know they have that right, but only 17 percent were able to recall that freedom of assembly is guaranteed by the first amendment to the Constitution. 
   Only 7 percent remembered that the Constitution was written at the Constitutional Convention; 
   85 percent believed that the Constitution stated that ``All men are created equal''--or failed to answer the question; and only 58 percent agreed that the following statement is false: ``The Constitution states that the first language of the U.S. is English.'' 
   The American people love the Constitution. They believe the Constitution is good for them collectively and individually, but they do not understand much about it. And the same can be said with respect to constitutionalism. The same can be said with respect to the Members of Congress; that means both Houses. Not a huge number, I would wager, of the Members of the Congress of both Houses know a great deal about the Constitution. How many of them have ever read it twice? 
   Each of us takes an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States every time we are elected or reelected. We stand right up at that desk with our hand on the Bible--at least that is the image people have of us--and we swear in the presence of men and Almighty God to support and defend that Constitution. How many of us have read it twice? How many of us  really know what is in that Constitution? And yet we will suggest amendments to it. 
   With 91 percent of the people polled agreeing that the U.S. Constitution is important to themselves, it is a sad commentary that this national poll would reveal that so many of these same Americans are so hugely ignorant of their Constitution and of the American history that is relevant thereto. 
   Let us think together for a little while about this marvelous Constitution, its roots and origins and, in essence, the genesis of American constitutionalism--a subject about which volumes have been written and will continue to be written. It is with temerity that I would venture to expound upon such a grand subject, but I do so with a full awareness of my own limited knowledge and capabilities in this respect, which I freely admit, and for which I just as freely apologize. Nonetheless, let us have at it because the clock is running and time stops for no one, not even a modern day Joshua. 
   Was Gladstone correct in his reputed declaration that the Constitution was ``the most wonderful work ever struck off at a given time by the brain and purpose of man''? Well, hardly. 
   In 1787, the only written constitutions in the world existed in English-speaking America, where there were 13 State constitutions and a constitution for the Confederation of the States, which was agreed upon and ratified in 1781. That was our first National Constitution. Americans were the heirs of a constitutional tradition that was mature by the time of the Convention that met in Philadelphia. Americans had tested that tradition between 1776 and 1787 by writing eleven of the State constitutions and the Articles of Confederation. Later, with the writing of the United States Constitution, they brought to completion the tradition of constitutional design that had begun a century and a-half or two centuries earlier. 
   So when someone stands here and says that this Constitution just represents what those people of 1789 or 1787 or 1791 believed, what they thought, then I say we had better stop, look, and listen. The work of the Framers brought to completion the tradition of constitutional design that had begun a century and a half or two centuries earlier right here in America. 
   Let us move back in point of time and attempt to trace the roots of what is in this great organic document, the Constitution of the United States. Looking back, the search--we are going backward in time now--takes us first to the Articles of Confederation. A lot of people in this country do not know that the Articles of Confederation ever existed. They have forgotten about them. They never hear about them anymore. And then to the earliest State constitutions, and back of these--going back, back in point of time--were the colonial foundation documents that are essentially constitutional, such as the Pilgrim Code of Law, and then to the proto-constitutions, such as the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut and the Mayflower Compact. As one scholar, Donald S. Lutz, has noted:  
   The political covenants written by English colonists in America lead us to the church covenants written by radical Protestants in the late 1500's and early 1600's, and these in turn lead us back to the Covenant tradition of the Old Testament.  
   It is appropriate, for our purposes here to focus for a short time on those Old Testament covenant traditions because they were familiar not only to the early settlers from Europe--your forebears and mine--but also to the learned men who framed the United States Constitution. 
   In the book of Genesis we are told that the Lord appeared to Abram saying: ``Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will show thee: and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great;'' (Genesis 12:1,2) 
   In Chapter 17 of Genesis, verses 4-7, God told Abram: ``As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations. Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee. . . . And I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee. And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.'' 
   Again, speaking to Abraham, God said: ``This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.'' (Genesis 17:10) 
   The Abrahamic covenant was confirmed upon subsequent occasions, one of which occurred after Abraham had prepared to offer Isaac, his son, as a burnt offering in obedience to God's command, at which time an angel of the Lord called out from heaven and commanded Abraham, ``Lay not thine hand upon the lad, . . . for now I know that thou fearest God.'' (Genesis 22:12) 
   The Lord then spoke to Abraham saying, ``I will bless thee, and in multiplying, I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore ..... because thou hast obeyed my voice.'' (Genesis 22:17,18) 
   God's covenant with Abraham was later confirmed in an appearance before Isaac, saying: ``Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of.'' Sojourn (see Gen. 26:3-5) 
   God subsequently confirmed and renewed this covenant with Jacob, as he slept with his head upon stones for his pillows and dreamed of a ladder set upon the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven, with angels of God ascending and descending on it. God spoke, saying: ``I am the Lord God of Abraham, ..... and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth ..... and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.'' (Genesis 28:11-14) 
   At Bethel, in the land of Canaan, Jacob built an altar to God, and God appeared unto Jacob, saying: ``Thy name is Jacob; thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name.'' And God said unto him, ``I am God almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins; and the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.'' (Genesis 35:10,11) 
   The book of Exodus takes up where Genesis leaves off, and we find that the descendants of Jacob had become a nation of slaves in Egypt. After a sojourn that lasted 430 years, God then brought the Israelites out of Egypt that he might bring them as his own prepared people into the Promised Land. Exodus deals with the birth of a nation, and all subsequent Hebrew history looks back to Exodus as the compilation of the acts of God that constituted the Hebrews a nation. 
   Thus far, we have seen the successive covenants entered into between God and Abraham and between God and Isaac and between God and Jacob; we have seen the creation of a nation through what might be described as a federation--there is the first system of federalism--a federation of the 12 tribes of Israel, the 12 sons of Jacob having been recognized as the patriarchs of their respective tribes. 
   Joshua succeeded Moses as leader of the Israelites. Then came the prophets and the judges of Israel, and the turmoils of the divided kingdoms of Judah and Israel. Samuel anointed the first king--Saul, and the kingship of David followed. Thus we see the establishment of a monarchy. 
   God covenanted with David, speaking to him through Nathan the prophet, and God promised to raise up David's seed after his death, according to which a son would be born of David, whose name would be Solomon. Furthermore, Solomon would build a house for the Lord and would receive wisdom and understanding. The Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, and the holy vessels of God, would be brought into the sanctuary that was to be built to the name of the Lord. 
   Now I have spoken of the creation of the Hebrew nation, and not without good reason. The American constitutional tradition derives much of its form and much of its content from the Judeo-Christian tradition as interpreted by the radical Protestant sects to which belonged so many of the original European settlers in British North America. 
   Donald S. Lutz, in his work entitled ``The Origins of American Constitutionalism'', says: ``The tribes of Israel  shared a covenant that made them a nation. American federalism originated at least in part in the dissenting Protestants' familiarity with the Bible''. 
   The early Calvinist settlers who came to this country from the Old World brought with them a familiarity with the Old Testament covenants that made them especially apt in the formation of colonial documents and state constitutions. 
   Winton U. Solberg tells us that in 17th-century colonial thought, divine law, a fusion of the law of nature in the Old and New Testaments, usually stood as fundamental law. The Mayflower Compact--we have all heard of that--the Mayflower Compact exemplified the Doctrine of Covenant or Contract. Puritanism exalted the biblical component and drew on certain scriptural passages for a theological outlook. Called the Covenant or Federal Theology, this was a theory of contract regarding man's relations with God and the nature of church and state. Man was deemed an impotent sinner until he received God's grace, and then he became the material out of which sacred and civil communities were built. 
   Another factor that contributed to the knowledge of the colonists and to their experience in the formation of local governments, was the typical charter from the English Crown. These charters generally required that the colonists pledge their loyalty to the Crown, but left up to them, the colonists, the formation of local governments as long as the laws which the colonists established comported with, and were not repugnant to, the laws of England. Boards of Directors in England nominally controlled the colonies. The fact that the colonies were operating thousands of miles away from the British Isles, together with the fact that the British Government was so involved in a bloody civil war, made it possible for the American colonies to operate and evolve with much greater freedom and latitude than would otherwise have been the case. The experiences gained by the colonists in writing documents that formed the basis for local governments, and the benefits that flowed from experience in the administration of those colonial governments, contributed greatly to the reservoir of understanding of politics and constitutional principles developed by the Framers. 
   Although the Constitution makes no specific mention of federalism, the federal system of 1787 was not something new to the Framers. Compacts had long been used as a device to knit settlements together. For example, the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, 1639, established a Common government for the towns of Hartford, Windsor, and Wethersfield, while each town government remained intact. In 1642, the towns of Providence, Pocasset, Portsmouth, and Warwick in Rhode Island devised a compact known as the Organization of the Government of Rhode Island, a federation which became a united colony under the 1663 Rhode Island Charter. The New England Confederation of 1643 was a compact for uniting the colonies of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Plymouth, and New Haven, each of which was comprised of several towns that maintained their respective governments intact. 
   Thus, the Framers were guided by a long experience with federalism or confederalism, including the Articles of Confederation--an experience that was helpful in devising the new national federal system. 
   Lutz says that the states, in writing new constitutions in the 1770s, ``drew heavily upon their respective colonial experience and institutions. In American constitutionalism, there was more continuity and from an earlier date than is generally credited.'' 
   That is why I am here today speaking on this subject. Let it be heard. Let it be known that the roots of this Constitution go farther back than 1787, farther back than its ratification in 1791--farther back. They were writing based on historical experiences that went back 1,000 years, before the Magna Carta, back to the Anglo-Saxons, back another 2,000 years, back another 1,500 years, back to the federalism of the Jewish tribes of Israel and Judah. 
   Wake up. This Constitution wasn't just born yesterday or in 1787. Let us go back to history. Let us study the history of American constitutionalism, its roots, how men suffered under oppressive governments. Then we will have a little better understanding of this Constitution. No, the Constitution is not static. History is not static. The journey of mankind over the centuries is not static. We can always learn from history. 
   To what extent were the Framers influenced by political theorists and republican spokesmen from Britain and the Continent? According to Solberg, republican spokesmen in England constituted an important link on the road to the realization of a republic in the United States. 
   I hear Senators stand on this floor and say that we live in a democracy. This is not a democracy. This is a republic. You don't have to believe ROBERT C. BYRD. Go to Madison, go to ``The Federalist Papers,'' Federalist Paper No. 10 or Federalist Paper No. 14--those of you who are listening--and you will find the definition of a democracy and the definition of a republic. You will find the difference between the two. 
   John Milton, whose literary accomplishments and Puritanism assured him of notice in the colonies, was significant for the views expressed in his political writings. He supported the sovereign power of the people, argued for freedom of publications, and justified the death penalty for tyrants. 
   English political thinkers who influenced American constitutionalism and who exerted an important influence in the colonies were Bolingbroke, Addison, Pope, Hobbes, Blackstone, and Sir Edward Coke. And there were others. 
   John Locke may be said to have symbolized the dominant political tradition in America down to and in the convention of 1787. 
   Locke equated property with ``life, liberty, and estate'' and was the crucial right on which man's development depends. Nature, Locke thought, creates rights. Society and government are only 
   auxiliaries which arise when men consent to create them in order to preserve property in the larger sense, and a community calls government into being to secure additional protection for existing rights. As representatives of the people, the legislature is supreme but is itself controlled by the fundamental law. Locke limits government by separating the legislative and administrative functions of government to the end that power may not be monopolized. That is assured by our Constitution also. The people possess the ultimate right of resisting a government which abuses its delegated powers. Such a violation of the contract justified the community in resuming authority. 
   David Hume dealt with the problem of faction in a large republic, and promoted the device of fragmenting election districts. Madison, when faced with the same problem in preparing for the federal convention, supported the idea of an extended republic--drawing upon Hume's solution. 
   Blackstone's view was that Parliament was supreme in the British system and that the locus of sovereignty was in the lawmaking body. His absolute doctrine was summed up in the aphorism that ``Parliament can do anything except make a man a woman or a woman a man.'' 
   His ``Commentaries on the Laws of England'' was the most complete survey of the English legal system ever composed by a single hand. The commentaries occupied a crucial role in legal education, and many of Blackstone's ideas were uppermost on American soil from 1776 to 1787, with vital significance for constitutional development both in the states and in Philadelphia. Although delegates to the convention acknowledged Blackstone as the preeminent authority on English law, they, nevertheless, succeeded in separating themselves from some of his other views. 
   James Harrington's ``Oceana'' presented a republican constitution for England in the guise of a utopia. He concluded that since power does follow property, especially landed property, the stability of society depends on political representation reflecting the actual ownership of property. The distinguishing feature of Harrington's commonwealth was ``an empire of laws and not of men.'' Harrington proposed an elective ballot, rotation in office, indirect election, and a two-chamber legislature. 
   This goes back a long way, doesn't it?  
   Harrington proposed legislative bicameralism as a precaution against the dangers of extreme democracy, even in a commonwealth in which property ownership was widespread. He argued that a small and conservative Senate should be able to initiate and discuss but not decide measures, whereas a large and popular house should resolve for or against these without discussion. 
   These were novel but significant ideas that became influential in America, in this country, before 1787. John Adams was an ardent disciple of Harrington's views. 
   James Harrington was the modern advocate of mixed government most influential in America. That is what ours is. The government of his ``Oceana'' consisted of a Senate which represented the aristocracy; a huge assembly elected by the common people, thus representing a democracy; and an executive, representing the monarchical element, to provide a balancing of power. 
   Harrington's respect for mixed government was shared by Algernon Sidney, who declared: ``There never was a good government in the world that did not consist of the three simple species of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy.'' 
   The mixed government theorists saw the British king, the House of Lords, and the House of Commons as an example of a successful mixed government. 
   The notion of mixed government goes all the way back to Herodotus, and who knows how far beyond. It was a notion that had been around for several centuries. Herodotus in his writings concerning Persia had expounded on the idea, but it had lost popularity until it was revived by the historian Polybius who lived between the years circa 205-125 B.C. It was a governmental form that pitted the organs of government representing monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy against each other to achieve balance and, thus, stability. 
   The practice of mixed government collapsed along with the Roman Republic, but the doctrine was revived in 17th century England--now we are getting closer--from which it passed to the New World. Those who wrote the Constitution weren't just writing based on the experiences of their time. 
   Let us turn now to a consideration of the renowned French philosopher and writer, Montesquieu. Montesquieu had a considerable impact upon the political thinking of our constitutional Framers. They were conversant with the political theory and philosophy of Montesquieu, who was born 1689--a hundred years before our Republic was formed--and died in 1755. He died just 32 years before our constitutional forebears met in Philadelphia. 
   Americans of the Revolutionary period were well acquainted with the philosophical and political writings of Montesquieu in reference to the separation of powers, and John Adams was particularly strong in supporting the doctrine of separation of powers in a mixed government. 
   Montesquieu advocated the principle of separation of powers. He possessed a belief, which was faulty, that a huge territory did not lend itself to a large republic. He believed that government in a vast expanse of territory would require force and this would lead to tyranny. 
   He believed that the judicial, executive, and legislative powers should be separated. If they were kept separated, the result would be political freedom, but if these various powers were concentrated in one man, as in his native France, then the result would be tyranny. 
   Montesquieu visited the more important and larger political divisions of Europe and spent a considerable time in England. His extensive English connections had a strong influence on the development of his political philosophy. 
   We are acquainted with his ``Spirit of the Laws'' and with his ``Persian Letters,'' but perhaps we are not so familiar with the fact that he also wrote an analysis of the history of the Romans and the Roman state. This essay, titled ``Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and their Decline,'' was produced in 1734. 
   Considering the fact that Montesquieu was so deeply impressed with the ancient Romans and their system of government, and in further consideration of his influence upon the thinking of the Framers and upon the thinking of educated Americans generally during the period of the American Revolution, let us consider the Roman system as it was seen by Polybius, the Greek historian, who lived in Rome from 168 B.C., following the battle of Pydna, until after 150 B.C., at a time when the Roman Republic was at a pinnacle of majesty that excited his admiration and comment. 
   Years later, Adams recalled that the writings of Polybius ``Were in the contemplation of those who framed the American Constitution.'' 
   Polybius provided the most detailed analysis of mixed government theory. He agreed that the best constitution assigned approximately equal amounts of power to the three orders of society and explained that only a mixed government could circumvent the cycle of discord which was the inevitable product of the simple forms. 
   Polybius saw the cycle as beginning when primitive man, suffering from violence, privation, and fear, consented to be ruled by a strong and brave leader. When the son was chosen to succeed this leader, in the expectation that the son's lineage would lead him to emulate his father, the son, having been accustomed to a special status from birth, was lacking in a sense of duty to the public and, after acquiring power, sought to distinguish himself from the rest of the people. Thus, monarchy deteriorated into tyranny. The tyranny then would be overturned by the noblest of aristocrats who were willing to risk their lives. The people naturally chose them to succeed the king as ruler, the result being ``ruled by the best,''--an aristocracy. 
   Soon, however, aristocracy deteriorated into oligarchy because, in time, the aristocrats' children placed their own welfare above the welfare of the people. A democracy was created when the oppressed people rebelled against the oligarchy. But in a democracy, the wealthy corrupted the people with bribes and created faction in order to raise themselves above the common level in the search for status and privilege and additional wealth. Violence then resulted and ochlocracy (mob rule) came into being. 
   As the chaos mounted to epic proportions, the people's sentiment grew in the direction of a dictatorship, and monarchy reappeared. Polybius believed that this cycle would repeat itself over and over again indefinitely until the eyes of the people opened to the wisdom of balancing the power of the three orders. 
   Polybius considered the Roman Republic to be the most outstanding example of mixed government. 
   Polybius viewed the Roman Constitution as having three elements: the executive, the Senate, and the people; with their respective shares of power in the state regulated by a scrupulous regard to equality and equilibrium. 
   Let us examine this separation of powers in the Roman Republic as explained by Polybius. The consuls--representing the executive--were the supreme masters of the administration of the government when remaining in Rome. All of the other magistrates, except the tribunes, were under the consuls and took their orders from the consuls. The consuls brought matters before the Senate that required its deliberation, and they saw to the execution of the Senate's decrees. In matters requiring the authorization of the people, a consul summoned the popular meetings, presented the proposals for their decision, and carried out the decrees of the majority. The majority rules. 
   In matters of war, the consuls imposed such levies upon manpower as the consuls deemed appropriate, and made up the roll for soldiers and selected those who were suitable. Consuls had absolute power to inflict punishment upon all who were under their command, and had all but absolute power in the conduct of military campaigns. 
   As to the Senate, it had complete control over the treasury, and it regulated receipts and disbursements alike. The quaestors (or secretaries of the treasury) could not issue any public money to the various departments of the state without a decree of the Senate. The Senate also controlled the money for the repair and construction of public works and public buildings throughout Italy, and this money could not be obtained by the censors, who oversaw the contracts for public works and public buildings, except by the grant of the Senate.  
   The Senate also had jurisdiction over all crimes in Italy requiring a public investigation, such as treason, conspiracy, poisoning, or willful murder, as well as controversies between and among allied states. Receptions for ambassadors, and matters affecting foreign states, were the business of the Senate. 
   What part of the Constitution was left to the people? The people participated in the ratification of treaties and alliances, and decided questions of war and peace. The people passed and repealed laws--subject to the Senate's veto--and bestowed public offices on the deserving, which, according to Polybius, ``are the most honorable rewards for virtue.'' 
   Polybius, having described the separation of powers under the Roman Constitution, how did the three parts of state check and balance each other? Polybius explained the checks and balances of the Roman Constitution, as he had observed them first hand. Remember, he was living in Rome at the time. 
   What were the checks upon the consul, the executive? The consul--whose power over the administration of the government when in the city, and over the military when in the field, appeared absolute--still had need of the support of the Senate and the people. The consul needed supplies for his legions, but without a decree of the Senate, his soldiers could be supplied with neither corn nor clothes nor pay. Moreover, all of his plans would be futile if the Senate shrank from danger, or if the Senate opposed his plans or sought to hamper them. Therefore, whether the consul could bring any undertaking to a successful conclusion depended upon the Senate, which had the absolute power, at the end of the consul's one-year term, to replace him with another consul or to extend his command or his tenure. 
   The consuls were also obliged to court the favor of the people, so here is the check of the people against the consuls, for it was the people who would ratify, or refuse to ratify, the terms of peace. But most of all, the consuls, when laying down their office at the conclusion of their one-year term, would have to give an accounting of their administration, both to the Senate and to the people. It was necessary, therefore, that the consuls maintain the good will of both the Senate and the people. 
   What were the checks against the Senate? The Senate was obliged to take the multitude into account and respect the wishes of the people, for in matters directly affecting the Senators--for instance, in the case of a law diminishing the Senate's traditional authority, or depriving Senators of certain dignities, or even actually reducing the property of Senators--in such cases, the people had the power to pass or reject the laws of the Assembly. 
   In addition, according to Polybius, if the tribunes imposed their veto, the Senate would not only be unable to pass a decree, but could not even hold a meeting. And because the tribunes must always have a regard for the people's wishes, the Senate could not neglect the feelings of the multitude. 
   But as a counter balance, what check was there against the people? We have seen certain checks against the consul; we have described some of the checks against the Senate. What about the people? According to Polybius, the people were far from being independent of the Senate, and were bound to take its wishes into account, both collectively and individually. 
   For example, contracts were given out in all parts of Italy by the censors for the repair and construction of public works and public buildings. Then there was the matter of the collection of revenues from rivers and harbors and mines and land--everything, in a word, that came under the control of the Roman government. In all of these things, the people were engaged, either as contractors or as pledging their property as security for the contractors, or in selling supplies or making loans to the contractors, or as engaging in the work and in the employ of the contractors. 
   Over all of these transactions, says Polybius, the Senate ``has complete control.'' For example, it could extend the time on a contract and thus assist the contractors; or, in the case of unforeseen accident, it could relieve the contractors of a portion of their obligation, or it could even release them altogether if they were absolutely unable to fulfill the contract. Thus, there were many ways in which the Senate could inflict great hardships upon the contractors, or, on the other hand, grant great indulgences to the contractors. But in every case, the appeal was to the Senate. 
   Moreover, the judges were selected from the Senate, at the time of Polybius, for the majority of trials in which the charges were heavy. Consequently, the people were cautious about resisting or actively opposing the will of the Senate, because they were uncertain as to when they might need the Senate's aid. For a similar reason, the people did not rashly resist the will of the consuls because one and all might, in one way or another, become subject to the absolute power of the consuls at some point in time. 
   Polybius had spoken of a regular cycle of constitutional revolution, and the natural order in which constitutions change, are transformed, and then return again to their original stage. Plato on the same line, had arranged six classifications in pairs: kingship would degenerate into tyranny; aristocracy would degenerate into oligarchy; and democracy would degenerate into violence and mob rule--after which, the cycle would begin all over again. Aristotle had had a similar classification. 
   According to Polybius, Lycurgus--the Spartan lawgiver of, circa, the 9th century B.C.--was fully aware of these changes, and accordingly combined together all of the excellences and distinctive features of the best constitutions, in order that no part should become unduly predominant and be perverted into its kindred vice; and that, each power being checked by the others, no one part should turn the scale or decisively overbalance the others; but that, by being accurately adjusted and in exact equilibrium, ``the whole might remain long steady like a ship sailing close to the wind.'' 
   Polybius summed it up in this way:  
   When any one of the three classes becomes puffed up, and manifests an inclination to be contentious and unduly encroaching, the mutual interdependency of all the three, and the possibility of the pretensions of any one being checked and thwarted by the others, must plainly check this tendency. And so the proper equilibrium is maintained by the impulsiveness of the one part being checked by its fear of the other.  
   Polybius' account may not have been an exact representation of the true state of the Roman system, but he was on the scene, and he was writing to tell us what he saw with his own eyes, not through the eyes of someone else. What better witness could we have? 
   Mr. President, before the Convention was assembled, Madison studied the histories of all these ancient people--the different kinds of governments--aristocracy, oligarchy, monarchy, democracy, and republic. He prepared himself for this Convention. And there were others in that Convention who were very well prepared also--James Wilson, Dr. William Samuel Johnson, and others. 
   The theory of a mixed constitution had had its great measure of success in the Roman Republic. It is not surprising then, that the Founding Fathers of the United States should have been familiar with the works of Polybius, or that Montesquieu should have been influenced by the checks and balances and separation of powers in the Roman constitutional system, a clear and central element of which was the control over the purse, vested solely in the Senate in the heyday of the Republic. 
   Were the Framers influenced by the classics? 
   Every schoolchild and student in the universities learned how to read and write Greek and Latin. Those were required subjects. 
   The founders were steeped in the classics, and both the Federalists and the Anti-federalists resorted to ancient history and classical writings in their disquisitions. Not only were classical models invoked; the founders also had their classical ``antimodels''--those individuals and government forms of antiquity whose vices and faults they desired to avoid. 
   Classical philosophers and the theory of natural law were much discussed during the period prior to and immediately following the American Revolution. It was a time of great political ferment, and thousands of circulars,  pamphlets, and newspaper columns displayed the erudition of Americans who delighted in classical allusions. 
   Our forbears were erudite. They circulated their pamphlets and their newspaper columns. They talked about these things. Who today studies the classics? Who today studies the different models and forms of government? Who today writes about them? 
   The 18th-century educational system provided a rich classical conditioning for the founders and immersed them with an indispensable training. They were familiar with Ovid, Homer, Horace, and Virgil, and they had experienced solid encounters with Tacitus, Thucydides, Livius, Plutarch, Suetonius, Eutropius, Xenophon, Florus, and Cornelius Nepos, as well as Caesar's Gallic Wars. They were undoubtedly influenced by a thorough knowledge of the vices of Roman emperors, the logic of orations by Cicero and Demosthenes, and the wisdom and virtue of the scriptures. 
   They freely used classical symbols, pseudonyms, and allusions to communicate through pamphlets and the press. To persuade their readers they frequently wrapped themselves and their policies in such venerable classical pseudonyms as ``Aristides,'' ``Tully'', ``Cicero'', ``Horatius'', and ``Camillus.'' The Federalist essays, 85 of them in number were signed by ``Publius.'' 
   Some of the Anti-federalists dubbed themselves ``Cato,'' while others called themselves ``Cincinnatus'' or ``A Plebeian.'' The appropriation of classical pseudonyms was sometimes used in private discourse for secret correspondence. George Washington's favorite play was Joseph Addison's ``Cato'' in which Cato committed suicide rather than submit to Caesar's occupation of Utica. 
   In the words of Carl J. Richard, in his book ``The Founders and the Classics''  
   It is my contention that the classics exerted a formative influence upon the founders, both directly and through the mediation of Whig and American perspectives. The classics supplied mixed government theory, the principal basis for the U.S. Constitution. The classics contributed a great deal to the founders' conception of human nature, their understanding of the nature and purpose of virtue, and their appreciation of society's essential role in its production. The classics offered the founders companionship and solace, emotional resources necessary for coping with the deaths and disasters so common in their era. The classics provided the founders with a sense of identity and purpose, assuring them that their exertions were part of a grand universal scheme. The struggles of the Revolutionary and Constitutional periods gave the founders a sense of kinship with the ancients, a thrill of excitement at the opportunity to match their classical heroes' struggles against tyranny and their sage construction of durable republics. In short, the classics supplied a large portion of the founders' intellectual tools.  
   Now, what about the Declaration of Independence?

   Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. 
   Mr. President, what impact did the Articles of Confederation have upon the Constitution of the United States? 
   On June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee of Virginia introduced a resolution in the Continental Congress resolving:  
   That these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent states, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved. 
   That is expedient forthwith to take the most effectual measures for forming foreign alliances. 
   That a plan of confederation be prepared and transmitted to the respective colonies for their consideration and approbation.  
   In accordance with this resolution, Congress appointed a committee of 12 on June 12--which happens to be my lovely wife's birthday, June 12, although she does not go that far back--1776, to prepare a form of confederation. A month later, on July 12, a draft plan was reported by the committee, written by John Dickinson of Delaware. The document, although reported to Congress on August 20, was delayed in its final consideration, and after having undergone modifications, was finally approved by the last holdout State of Maryland in February 1781, and the Congress, then, first met under the Articles of Confederation on March 1, 1781. 
   It had been a long time aborning. 
   New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland had demanded that the States that had large claims to western lands renounce them in favor of the Confederation. Maryland was the last State to ratify the Articles, but finally went along when she became satisfied that the western claims would become the expected treasure of the entire Nation. 
   The Articles of Confederation were the direct predecessor of the Constitution of the United States, and the Articles contained within themselves the fatal flaws which doomed the success of the confederation. It was a ``league of friendship'' only, of which the Congress was the unique organ and in which ``each state shall have one vote.'' The votes of nine States were required before important action could be taken by Congress, and the consent of the legislature of each State was necessary to any amendment of the fundamental law. 
   Congress was given no commercial control and, most unfortunately, no power to raise money, but could only make requisitions on the States and then hope and pray that the States would respond affirmatively and adequately. They seldom if ever did. Control over foreign affairs was vested in Congress, but it was without means of making the States obey treaty requirements. The Congress had responsibility but without power to carry out its responsibility. It dealt with the people, not individually, but over their heads through the States. 
   Several efforts were made to get the States to amend the articles, by adding the right to levy import duties, but these efforts failed because it was impossible to get the unanimous consent of the legislatures of the 13 States to any amendment of the fundamental law. 
   It became increasingly difficult to secure a quorum of attendance in Congress, and even when a quorum of Members attended, important measures were blocked by the requirement for the votes of nine States. A State frequently lost its single vote--that is all it had--because of differences among its delegates. It was a time of experimentation, of learning a hard lesson that would be remembered. But the experience gained from learning these hard lessons helped to prepare the way for a better national government. It should also be remembered that at least one substantial act of legislation--the ordinance for the government of the Northwest Territory, was created by the government under the Articles of Confederation. 
   Under the Articles of Confederation, no State could be represented in Congress by less than two, nor by more than seven, members; and no person could serve as a delegate for more than three years in any term of six years. There were limited terms. Each State had only one vote. All charges of war and other expenses incurred for the common defense or general welfare, if allowed by the United States in Congress assembled, were to be defrayed out of a common treasury, which would be supplied by the several States in proportion to the value of all lands within each State, and the taxes for paying a State's proportion were to be laid and levied by the authority of the legislatures of the several States within the time agreed upon by the Congress. 
   Under a very complex arrangement--I say to the former Attorney General of the State of Alabama, who presently presides over this august body--the Congress under the Confederation was denominated as the last resort on appeal in all disputes and differences arising between two or more States ``concerning boundary jurisdiction or any other cause whatever.'' 
   The business of Congress was to be carried on during a recess by ``a committee of the states,'' to consist of one delegate from each State. 
   When it came to the armed forces, requisitions were to be made from each State for its quota, in proportion to the number of white inhabitants in such States, which requisitioned would be binding. Each State would appoint the regimental officers, raise them in and clothe and arm and equip them at the expense of the United States. 
   However, if the Confederation Congress should determine, based on circumstances, that any State should raise a smaller number than its quota and that any other State should raise a greater number of men than its quota called for, the extra number was to be raised, clothed, and equipped as the quota allowed, unless the 
   legislature of that State should judge that such extra number could not be safely spared. The State would be permitted to raise ``as many of such extra number'' as the State judged could be safely spared. 
   What a flawed approach! It is little wonder that George Washington, as Commander in Chief of the Revolutionary forces, was constantly frustrated in his efforts to build an effective fighting force. It was almost a miracle that the fledgling Nation managed to carry on and win the war under such conditions, but we can only guess  that Providence was on our side. We know for sure that the situation in England was such that that country's preoccupation with its own internal problems rendered impossible the full concentration of its resources and strength to be brought to bear against us. We were lucky in that regard. 
   Under the Articles, the ``Union shall be perpetual'' nor could any alteration be made in the Articles--there could be no amendment to that Constitution--unless such alteration was agreed upon in Congress assembled and afterwards confirmed by the legislature of every state. 
   The Articles of Confederation contained the phrase ``The United States of America,'' for the first time in American documentary history. The Articles were America's first national constitution. Congress was elected by the State legislatures. There was only one body of Congress, not two, back then, as we see today. And Congress was the executive, the legislative branch, and the judiciary in many respects. There was no man living downtown at the White House who was President. 
   Now let us examine the parallels between the Articles of Confederation and the U.S. Constitution. 
   I am here showing where the roots of the Constitution go. It is like tracing the roots of a tooth, if one is having a root canal, let us find where those roots go. 
   Article II of the Articles of Confederation provided that each State would retain its sovereignty and every power and right ``which is not by this confederation expressly delegated to the United States, . . .'' Where do we find that in the Constitution? The tenth amendment to the U.S. Constitution provided that the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the States ``are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.'' 
   Article IV of the Articles of Confederation provided that the people of the different States would ``be entitled to all privileges and immunities of free citizens in the several states'', that ``full faith and credit'' should be given in each of the States to the records, acts, and judicial proceedings of the courts and magistrates of every other state; and that any person guilty of a felony in any state who fled from justice and was found in any other state, would ``upon demand of the Governor or executive power of the state from which he fled,'' be delivered up ``to the state having jurisdiction of his offense.'' 
   The ``privileges and immunities'' clause of the Articles of Confederation, found in article IV thereof, appears in the U.S. Constitution in article IV, section 2. 
   The ``full faith and credit'' clause of the Articles of Confederation is to be found in the U.S. Constitution, article IV, section 1. 
   The delivering up of persons charged with felonies to another state on demand of the executive authority thereof, found in article IV of the Articles is also found in article IV, section 2, paragraph 2, of the U.S. Constitution.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Minnesota for his characteristic courtesy. 
   Article 5 of the Articles provided for the meeting of Congress on the first Monday in November in every year. Under the U.S. Constitution, article I, section 4, paragraph 2, Congress ``shall assemble at least once in every year, and such meeting was originally to have been on the first Monday in December, but this was changed to provide that Congress could by law appoint a different day from that of Monday in December. 
   Under article V of the Articles of Confederation, freedom of speech and debate in Congress could not be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Congress. Under the U.S. Constitution, article I, section 6, members of Congress, for any speech or debate in either House, ``shall not be questioned in any other place.'' 
   Article V of the Articles protects members of Congress from arrests during the time of their going to and from, and attendance in Congress, except for treason felony, or breach of the peace. 
   Members of Congress are likewise protected under article I, section 6, paragraph 1, of the U.S. Constitution. 
   Article VI of the Articles precludes any person holding office of profit or trust under the United States from accepting any present, emolument, office or title of any kind whatever from any king, prince or foreign state. Nor could Congress grant any title of nobility. 
   In almost identical language, the U.S. Constitution, in article I, section 9, paragraph 7, prohibits members of Congress from accepting any present, emolument, office, or title, from any king, prince or foreign state. 
   Under the Articles of Confederation no vessels of war or any body of forces could be kept up in time of peace without the consent of Congress. The same prohibition against the states was included in the U.S. Constitution in article 1, section 10, paragraph 2. 
   Provisions concerning state militias are contained in article VI of the Articles, and in article I, section 8, of the U.S. Constitution. 
   Article IX of the Articles vested the power of declaring war, establishing rules for captures on land or water, and granting letters of marque and reprisal. The equivalent provisions are to be found in article I, section 8, of the U.S. Constitution. 
   So, you see, these provisions are not something new that just came from the minds, from the heads of our constitutional forebears and the Constitutional Convention in 1787. They were already written down in other places. Thank God for that and for their guidance, as it were. 
   Both the Articles of Confederation and the U.S. Constitution provide for the trail of piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, in article IX of the Articles and in article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. 
   Article IX of the Articles of Confederation gave Congress the sole and exclusive right and power of regulating the alloy and value of coin, fixing the standard of weights and measures throughout the United States, and regulating the trade and managing all affairs with the Indians. Congress under the Constitution was given the same powers in article I, section 8. 
   The power to establish and regulate post offices, and the power to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces was given to the Congress by the Articles of Confederation in article IX. The same powers to establish post offices and to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces were given to the Congress in article I, section 8, of the U.S. Constitution. 
   Article IX of the Confederation Articles provided that the yeas and nays of members of Congress were to be entered on the journal when desired by any member of the Congress. The U.S. Constitution article I, section 5 provided for the yeas and nays of members to be entered on the journal when desired by one-fifth of those members present. 
   The admission of other colonies into the confederation was provided for in article 11 of the Articles of Confederation, while, under the Constitution new States may be admitted by Congress into the Union, under Section 3 of article IV. 
   So, you see, we had a good roadmap in the Articles of Confederation, which went before the U.S. Constitution. 
   Congress was given power under the Articles of Confederation to borrow money on the credit of the United States, to build and equip a navy, to agree upon the number of land forces. Under the Constitution, article I, section 8, Congress was given the power to borrow money on the credit of the United States; to raise and support armies; and to provide and maintain a navy. 
   In article XIII of the Articles of Confederation, every state was required to abide by the determination of Congress, and the Articles of Confederation were to be inviolably observed by every state. The counterpart of these provisions is to be found in the U.S. Constitution, article VI, paragraph 2, where it is provided that the Constitution and the laws of the United States, and all treaties made, ``shall be the supreme law of the land''; and the judges in every state were to be bound thereby.  
   Article V of the U.S. Constitution provides for amendments to that document when proposed by two-thirds of both Houses of Congress or upon the application of two-thirds of the state legislatures. Amendments to the Articles of Confederation required approval by the Congress, followed by confirmation by the legislature of all the states. 
   The Articles set up what amounts to a national court system (article IX), but the system functioned only to adjudicate disputes between states, not individuals. Congress could pass no laws directly affecting individuals, and thus the national court had no jurisdiction over individuals. But when Congress was 
   given such power in the 1787 Constitution, the notion of dual citizenship was revolutionized. The invention of dual citizenship in the Articles of Confederation, and then the transfer of this concept to the national constitution in article VI, section 2, was the legal basis for the operation of federalism in all of its many manifestations. 
   Aside from the narrower grant of power to Congress, and a unicameral legislature in which each state had one vote, the Articles differed from the U.S. Constitution mainly in placing the court directly under Congress and in having the committee of the states (one delegate from each state) instead of a single executive. Characteristic of state constitution were a weak executive, often under the sway of a committee appointed or elected by the legislature, and a court system directly under the legislature. The Articles of Confederation in these respects was not the result of independent theorizing about the best institutions. It was a straightforward extension of Whig political thought to national government. 
   The Constitution of the United States provided, in article VII, for its ratification by the conventions of nine states. The ratification of any new Constitution, under the Articles of Confederation, required the approval of Congress and the unanimous confirmation by the legislatures of all states. 
   The Framers of the U.S. Constitution devised an ingenious way of getting around this insuperable requirement of unanimity by the state legislatures, and we can be thankful for that. Otherwise, we would still be governed by the unworkable Articles of Confederation--if, indeed, we had been able to survive as a nation. Ours might have been the balkanized States of America instead of the United States of America. This was done by circumventing the legislatures altogether, and securing ratification directly by the people in state conventions. 
   Why did the Founders require nine states to ratify the Constitution rather than 13 or a majority of seven? Experience, and the likelihood that Rhode Island would not ratify, made unanimity an impractical alternative. 
   A simple majority of seven might not have included the large states, and the new nation would have been crippled from the start. There was, however, considerable experience with a nine-state requirement in the Continental Congress. You see how these Framers benefited by the experience that had gone before them. Nine states constituted a two-thirds majority. Although such a majority was at times extremely difficult to construct, a provision that satisfied nine states invariably satisfied more than nine. This was a litmus test that the Framers understood, and the two-thirds majority required by the Articles led them to adopt a similar requirement for ratifying the constitution. 
   Without the Articles of Confederation, the extended republic would have had to be invented out of the writings of Europeans as a rank experiment that a skeptical public would likely not have accepted. On the other hand, Americans had learned that government on a continental basis was possible, in certain respects desirable, and that a stable effective national government required more than an extended republic--it needed power that could be applied directly to individuals. Experience also convinced them that the national government should have limited powers, and that state governments could not be destroyed. There was a logic to experience that no amount of reading and political theory could shake. 
   Providing for an amendment process was one of the most innovative aspects of both national constitutions. Equally innovative was the provision for admitting new states. History had demonstrated that a nation adding new territory almost invariably treated it as conquered land, as did the ancient Romans, the Greeks, the Persians, and so on. The founders proposed the future addition, on an equal footing, of new states from territories now sparsely settled, if settled at all. The Articles of Confederation is of major historical importance for first containing this extraordinarily liberal provision, which became part of the U.S. Constitution. It guaranteed the building of an extended republic. 
   The general impression of the people today is that the Articles of Confederation were wholly replaced in 1787, but, in fact, as I have shown, much of what was in the Articles showed up in the 1787 Constitution. As a matter of fact, few Americans today, relatively speaking, know much if anything about the Articles of Confederation or are even aware that such Articles ever existed. 
   But not only did the Framers of the Constitution copy into that document a great deal of what was contained in the Articles of Confederation, but by virtue of the fact that they had lived under the Articles for over 6 years, they benefited from the experience gained thereby and were thus able to avoid many of the faults and flaws of the Articles by including in the Constitution corrective provisions for such avoidance. In other words, many of the provisions of the U.S. Constitution which have worked so well over these 212 years probably would never have been included in the Constitution, or even thought of, without having had the experience of living under the Articles. It could perhaps better be said that the Framers profited by the mistakes or negative experiences of living under the Articles. In other words, hindsight provided a 20/20 vision to the Framers. 
   Mr. President, as we examine the roots of our Constitution, how could we avoid taking a look at the British Constitution? 
   What part did the British Constitution play in the formulation of our own fundamental organic national document? Perhaps not as much directly as did the state constitutions and the Articles of Confederation. Yet, indirectly, woven into the experience of living under the colonial governments and the early state constitutions and the Articles of Confederation there were, running throughout, important threads of the ancient British Constitution that are often overlooked and were accepted as a practice in the early colonial documents and state constitutional forms without conscious attribution. Nevertheless, consciously or not, various rudiments of the American system can be traced back to developments that had occurred in England and even as far back as the Anglo-Saxon period which found their way into the fabric of American constitutionalism. Let us examine some of these antecedents. 
   Many of the principles imbedded in American constitutionalism look back to the annals of the motherland for their sources and explanations and were carried forward by the political development of many generations of men. 
   To begin with, our nation was founded by colonists of whom the great majority, let us not forget, were of the English branch of the Teutonic race. For the most part, they were of one blood and their language and social usages were those of Great Britain. It is where my forebearers are from. The same can be said by others here. They brought with them to these North American shores the English law itself, and, for a century or more, they continued in political union with England as members of one empire, often referring to themselves as ``Englishmen away from home'', claiming all of the rights and liberties of British subjects. 
   Read your history. Forget those modern social studies. Go back to the history. Follow the taproots of our Constitution. 
   Their institutions were mainly of an English nature, and they possessed in common with their English brethren a certain stock of political ideas. For example, a single executive, a legislative branch consisting of two houses--the British House of Lords, and the British House of Commons--the upper of which  was conservative and the lower of which was representative of the people at large. There were also general principles such as trial by jury, taxation by the elected representatives of the people, and a system of jurisprudence based upon custom and the precedents of the English common law. 
   These liberties and these rights had been wrenched from tyrannical monarchs over centuries at the cost of blood--the blood of Englishmen, the people of the British Isles, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. 
   The earliest representative legislative assembly ever held in America was convened in 1619 at Jamestown and was composed of 22 representatives from several towns and counties. This was the germ of hundreds of later local, town, and state assemblies throughout America. 
   It also imitated the British Parliament, with the legislative power lodged partly in a Governor who held the place of the sovereign and who was appointed by the British Crown, partly in a council named by a British trading company, and partly in an assembly composed of representatives chosen by the people. Of course, no law was to be enforced until it was ratified by the company in England, and returned to the colony under that company's seal. Other representative legislative assemblies developed throughout the colonies, and laws were allowed to be made as long as such laws were not contrary or repugnant to the laws of England. There were, of course, variation in the systems of government throughout colonial America, but as we will note in the early state constitutions that were developed in 1776, as has already been noted, the repetition in many details of the political systems was evidence of the unanimity with which the colonies followed a common model. 
   Of course the power over the purse--we have talked about that many times, and I will just touch upon it here--is the central strand in the whole cloth of Anglo-American liberty. Let us engage in a kaleidoscopic viewing of the larger mosaic as it was spun on the loom of time. Let us trace a few of the Anglo-Saxon and later English footprints that left their indelible imprint on our own constitutional system. We have too often forgot and it seems to be a fetish these days, that we ought to forget our roots. 
   Several developments in the course of British history served as guideposts in the formation of the American Constitution. Many of the principles underlying the British Constitution were the result of lessons learned through centuries of strife and conflict between English monarchs and the people they ruled. The rights and liberties and immunities of Englishmen had been established by men who, like the authors of our Declaration of Independence, were willing to risk their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor for those rights.

   Mr. BYRD. And, since I have 5 remaining minutes, let me say again that what I am doing here is attempting to show that the U.S. Constitution is the result of the struggles of men in centuries before our own, this last year of the 20th century. Forget what the media says, forget what politicians say, this is not the first year of the 21st century, nor is it the first year of the third millennium. Anybody who can count, whether they use the old math or the new math, knows better than that. This is the last year of the 20th century. 
   But I want to show that these liberties, which were assured to us by our Federal Constitution, did not just spring up overnight like the prophet's gourd at Philadelphia. They had their roots going back decades, centuries--1,000 years or more, and that those roots and those documents--the Articles of Confederation, the State constitutions, the colonial documents, the covenants--the Mayflower Compact and all of these things--were known by the framers and they were guided in their writing of the Federal Constitution by the experience that had been gained by living under the articles, by living in the colonies, and by the lessons taught by the British experience which had come at the point of a sword and through the shedding of blood through many centuries before. This is not just something that sprang up there between May 25 and September 17, a total of 116 days in 1787. 
   I think it is good for us, as Members of the House and Senate, to just stop once in a while and draw back, take a look at the forest, try to see the forest and not just the trees, and restudy our history, restudy our roots, and establish ourselves again in the perspective of those Framers and their experiences, and understand that Marshall had it right when he said that the Constitution was meant to endure for ages. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, before I yield, if I may, before I yield to the distinguished Senator from Minnesota who has already been so very gracious and considerate to me, I thank my friend from Vermont. I have learned a lot of lessons from him. We can learn from one another. It is easy, very easy if we try. 
   I appreciate his friendship. I appreciate his statesmanship. I am very grateful for his being a stalwart defender of this great Constitution and one who has voted, alongside me, in many what I consider to be pretty critical votes that we have cast in this Senate. 
   I close my statement today with these words from Henry Clay:  
   The Constitution of the United States was made not merely for the generation that then existed, but for posterity--unlimited, undefined, endless, perpetual posterity.  
   Clay made those remarks in a Senate speech on January 29, 1850.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on two cloture motions, the first, to end debate on the Finance Committee's substitute amendment to H.R. 6, the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act, and, the second, to end debate on the underlying bill. 
   First, I am, as are others, deeply concerned with that anomaly in the tax code known as the ``marriage penalty.'' I can think of no rational reason why two individuals who have vowed a lifelong commitment to each other through the sacred institution of marriage should, in certain cases, have their combined income taxed at a higher rate than that of two unmarried persons. At a time of declining social values, it simply does not make sense for the Congress to sanction policies which clearly work to the detriment of family stability. 
   Throughout the annals of human experience, in dozens of civilizations and cultures of varying value systems, humanity has discovered that the permanent relationship between men and women is a keystone to the stability, strength, and health of human society. The purpose of this kind of union between human beings is primarily for the establishment of a home atmosphere in which a man and a woman pledge themselves exclusively to one another and who bring into being children for the fulfillment of their love for one another and for the greater good of the human community at large. Indeed, I doubt that any Senator would refute the assertion that the promotion of marriage and family stability is in the best interest of the nation as a whole. 
   The question then is how to utilize the nation's tax code to move towards this goal. Marriage neutrality, for reasons that I will leave to the distinguished Finance Committee Chairman, the Senator from Delaware, and, the Finance Committee ranking member, the Senator from New York, to explain, is seemingly incompatible with a progressive income tax system that allows for married couples to file jointly. That is, if this body believes that higher-income households should pay higher taxes than lower-income households, and that married couples should be allowed to file joint returns, marriage neutrality can be a difficult goal to achieve. While I applaud the efforts of the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from New York in their attempts to balance these seemingly incompatible goals, I remain hesitant about jumping on any bandwagon at this time without first raising some concerns. 
   My primary concern, which I would presume is a concern of all Senators, is the cost associated with each of these proposals. The Republican plan, upon which the majority leader has filed a cloture motion, would cost approximately $248 billion over 10 years, 
   and would explode after the first 10 years, costing the Federal Government $39 billion per year thereafter. This cost would be paid for through the non-Social Security surpluses that are projected by the Congressional Budget Office over the next 10 years. The so-called Democratic alternative, on the other hand, is not much better. The proposal would cost $150 billion over 10 years, but once fully phased in, is expected to cost about $48 billion per year thereafter. The basis upon which these tax cuts are being proposed is the presumption that the Congressional Budget Office's projections of non-Social Security surpluses will come to pass and will be large enough to cover tax cuts of this magnitude without causing the Federal budget to revert back into the kind of annual triple-digit billion dollar budget deficits we suffered over the last two decades. Never mind the fact that these non-Social Security surpluses are not yet in the hands of the Treasury. Never mind the fact that this Senate has not yet ensured that our domestic spending needs will be met in the coming years. Never mind the fact that such enormous tax cuts, once enacted, would be very difficult to reverse. 
   To its credit, however, the Democratic alternative is a substantively better proposal. Not only would it eliminate all sixty-five marriage penalties in the tax code, compared to the Republican proposal which would eliminate only three of the penalties, but it would also limit tax relief to those who actually suffer marriage penalties. Nevertheless, the Senate stands ready to shut down debate on these measures, and to effectively prohibit the Democratic alternative from being offered. Moreover, amendments that could possibly improve these proposals, or, at least, ensure that these proposals are enacted in the most cost efficient way possible, would also be limited--perhaps not to be allowed to be called up at all. 
   Another concern of mine is that both proposals are distributionally skewed away from lower- and middle-income families. Senators should be encouraged to offer amendments so that these proposals better target families who most need tax relief. Instead, Senators are discouraged from offering amendments to improve the measure. Watching the debate yesterday, I noted Senators suggesting that amendments  should be limited to only five or six so that the Senate could finish its work tonight and recess for the Easter break. As far as this Senator from West Virginia is concerned, if this legislation is as important as most Senators seem to think it is, we should stay in tomorrow, perhaps Saturday, and for as long as it takes to provide the best targeted, most cost-efficient tax package possible. This legislation should not be railroaded through this Chamber in order to accommodate a political deadline or to avoid debate on controversial amendments. 
   I, for one, will not support shutting down debate on these measures without first having these concerns addressed. I refuse to allow myself to be backed into a position where I must support limiting debate on a so-called marriage penalty relief bill simply to avoid political attacks that I do not support marriage penalty relief. My constituents understand my position on this matter. I have been married, now, almost 63 years, so I know about the marriage penalty. It has not changed over the years. I will oppose cloture on this bill, not because I am opposed to marriage penalty relief, but because I 
   am opposed to this kind of legislating. 
   Putting aside the policy implications of these votes for a moment, I am growing increasingly concerned about how this body is seemingly incapable of considering any legislation without, first, limiting amendments that may be offered, and, second, limiting the ability of Senators to debate the legislation. These marriage penalty proposals are only the most recent example of this new style of legislating. Education savings accounts, the Social Security earnings limit, and bankruptcy reform have all been debated in this fashion. The stock options bill that was brought to the floor was limited to one hour of debate with no amendments or motions in order. Presumably, this agreement was reached to prevent minimum wage amendments from being offered. Indeed, time after time, day after day cloture motions to end debate are being filed before debate even has a chance to get under way. 
   The rationale behind today's cloture vote is that a majority of constituents and legislators support marriage penalty relief, so this legislation should be passed without delay. Ironically, this is exactly why the Senate was established as the body of majority rule but minority right. When James Madison arrived in Philadelphia in 1787 to correct the ``injustices'' of the Articles of Confederation, he had derived a general theory of politics based on his experiences in the Virginia state legislature. His focus was on the majoritarian premises of popular government. While Madison pondered that legislators would primarily respond to the passions and interests of their constituents, he realized that minority rights were not so much to protect the people from government as to protect the people from popular majorities acting through government. In recent months, however, and, I say this not as a Democrat, but as a member of the minority, minority rights have been pushed aside in order to accommodate political expediency. The Democrats, as I observe them, are standing up for their rights as a minority, not attempting, as has been stated several times in the past, to dictate the Senate's schedule. This Democrat is certainly not trying to dictate the schedule. I do, however, have an interest in the Senate. And, I think that the Senate has gone downhill in recent years. I think that it is too partisan. I have seen bills called up, and cloture immediately filed upon them to end debate on them when there had been no debate. I, when I was majority leader, filed cloture motions in similar situations, but I never did it time after time and day after day, I did it very seldom. 
   Senators do have the right to offer amendments, they do have the right to debate those amendments, and they have the right to a roll call vote on those amendments if they want it. Similarly, this Senator, along with every other Senator in this body, has the right to debate amendments offered by other Senators and to a roll call vote on those amendments. This was the message that I was hoping to convey last Friday during the debate on the budget resolution. When I objected to the unanimous consent request regarding the inclusion of some fifty amendments to the budget resolution, my goal was not to prevent the consideration of those amendments. 
   In fact, I was suggesting that the Senate spend the extra time on Saturday and on Monday to debate and to vote on those amendments. It was my desire to hear debate and to vote on those amendments, not to move on to final passage. 
   The Senator who offers the amendment, of course, has a right to have debate on it and a right to ask for a vote. But any other Senator also has a right to hear the debate and also has a right to ask for a vote if he wants it. So it is not just the Senator who offers the amendment whose case is put in jeopardy because he is denied a vote. The whole Senate and the people I represent, the people the Senator from Rhode Island represents, are entitled to a debate also on the amendment. 
   As I have said before, I will not support the erosion of minority rights in the Senate simply to advance a politically popular initiative. I hope that my colleagues will take a moment to consider their votes in this context, rather than in the context of what is politically popular and expedient.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the conference report on the budget resolution for fiscal year 2001 has been adopted. I note that this will be the last budget resolution to be managed by my good friend from New Jersey, Senator LAUTENBERG. Senator LAUTENBERG joined the Budget Committee in 1985, 2 years after he was first elected to the Senate. Since that time, he has become an expert on the Federal budget process. He has worked hard. He has been diligent in his business.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, when many people contemplate Easter, thoughts of chocolate bunnies, Easter egg hunts, and family gatherings come to mind. Little girls dream of a new frilly lace-bedecked frock, shiny new patent leather shoes, and a festive bonnet adorned with ribbons and flowers to top it all off. It is hard not to feel an excitement in the air as the daylight hours increase, the winter coats are put away, and the sweet smell of the season's first roses fill the air. The landscape is freshly decorated with a pallet of azaleas, tulips, jonquils, and pink and white flowers of the dogwood. Overnight, it seems, the silhouettes of the tree branches disappear, replaced by the first green buds of spring. Neighbors, who seemed almost strangers during the long dark winter, suddenly greet you from their front porches, and passersby out for an afternoon stroll stop to offer that much-needed gardening advice, or they admire your latest planting. The first aroma of charcoal fills the air as grills are fired up after a long rest. Children play outside after dinner, trying to squeeze in every bit of the daylight into their playtime. Everything seems new, everything seems exciting, everything seems reborn. But during this season of rebirth, how many stop to ponder the true meaning of this most holiest of seasons of the Christian calendar? 
   Easter, Jesus' resurrection from the dead, was the key belief of the earliest Christians. In fact, that truly miraculous event has made an imprint on other religions and inspired to thought and deed individuals who do not practice the Christian faith. Mohandas K. Gandhi said simply and eloquently:  
   Jesus, a man who was completely innocent, offered himself as a sacrifice for the good of others, including his enemies, and became the ransom of the world. It was a perfect act.  
   The Bible says a great deal about Easter, that central mystery of the Christian faith. That Jesus was crucified and miraculously raised from the dead is hard for many to accept. It was hard for the early Christians to comprehend also, but the faith in the risen Christ spread like a wildfire on a dry and windy summer day! 
   Easter arrives late this year, on April 23, almost as late as it can possibly be. It is celebrated on a Sunday on varying dates between March 22 and April 25, and is, therefore, called a movable feast. Easter embodies many pre-Christian traditions. The origin of its name is unknown; however, many scholars have accepted the derivation proposed by the 8th-century English scholar St. Bede--that it probably comes from Eastre, the Anglo-Saxon name of a Teutonic goddess of spring and fertility, whose festival was celebrated on the day of the vernal equinox. The Easter rabbit, a symbol of fertility, and colored Easter eggs, originally painted with bright colors to represent the sunlight of spring, and used in egg-rolling contests, are traditions that have survived. According to the New Testament, Christ was crucified on the eve of Passover and soon rose from the dead. The Easter festival commemorated Christ's resurrection. Over time, there were serious differences between the early Christians over the date of the Easter festival. Those of Jewish origin celebrated Easter immediately after Passover, which fell on the evening of the full moon. Therefore, Easter, from year to year, fell on different days of the week. Christians of Gentile origin, on the other hand, wished to commemorate the resurrection on Sunday, the first day of the week. It was on the same day of the week each year, but fell on different dates from year to year. In 325 A.D. Roman Emperor Constantine the Great, who, early in his reign, issued a document allowing Christians to practice their religion within the empire, convoked the Council of Nicaea. The council unanimously ruled that the Easter festival should be celebrated throughout the Christian world on the first Sunday after the full moon following the vernal equinox. 
   At Easter, we receive again God's greatest gift of love: Jesus. Spring is a time to remember that gift. Death and resurrection are entwined not only in the death and resurrection of our Lord, but also in spring's final struggle with winter's strong grasp. There is a struggle in both dying and in birth and it is logical to think that something must be born in order to die. However, from Jesus' words in John's Gospel, Chapter 12, verses 23 and 24, as Jesus foresees his own death, the Bible tells us something different--it tells us that something must die in order to be born. Jesus says:  
   The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone, but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.  
   Easter is the time of year that finds many churches overflowing. Parking attendants direct traffic caused by the overflow of cars on this special day. Pews are packed tight. Extra chairs line the aisles, and much of this crowd only sees the inside of a church once a year, and Easter is the day. It is nice to see new faces. Those who attend church every Sunday look around at all the new faces, hoping they will become familiar, and struggle to find their regular seats. The struggle is worth it, however, because some of these same people will come back and join with the community that has worshiped together all year. They will become members of a church family like those who have risen in the darkness to watch the youth group tell the Easter story at sunrise--there is nothing like it, telling it at sunrise--or who are praising God with their voices in the choir, or who cooked the pancake breakfast for Palm Sunday, or who decorated the Sanctuary with Easter Lilies. Perhaps they will be like those who teach the children the meaning of God's love and grace in Sunday school classes. They will find a church home. They will find God. They will be awakened. They will be reborn! 
   During our lives, we all experience the loss of a loved one. Have you ever thought about the resurrection story in a way that brought you comfort in your time of grief? A little boy recently lost his grandfather, and one day, when he was remembering his grandfather, he said to his mother, ``Mom, Easter will be extra special this year. We will have two reasons to celebrate! Granddad and Jesus have both  risen!'' If a 6-year-old can understand the beauty of the Easter story on this level, think of the hope that this celebration can bring to others who are grieving. I talked with one of my constituents on yesterday who lost his wife. I said: Come Eastertime, your wife knows your grief. She knows about your sorrow. And the beauty of the story is, you can see her again. Every year at this time I remember my beloved grandson, Michael, who died in a tragic accident in 1982. I know that he is in a better place, and my faith in the Lord carries me through my sorrow. I can visualize Michael stepping out of the tomb with Christ, and I know that he, too, is ``alive.'' Hear these words of Trappist monk Henri Nouwen:  
   Easter does not make death less painful or our own grief less heavy. It does not make the loss less real, but Easter makes us see and feel that death is part of a much greater and much deeper event, the fullness of which we cannot comprehend, but which we know is a life-bringing event.  
   He goes on to say:  
   The best way I can express to you the meaning death receives in the light of the resurrection of Jesus is to say that the love that causes us so much grief and makes us feel so fully the absurdity of death is stronger than death itself. Love is stronger than death. The same love that makes us mourn and protest against death will now free us to live in hope.  
   So, Mr. President, let Easter be the time to remember that the tomb is empty, that those who have passed before us have been reborn and will live eternal life. Let us rejoice at this miracle and the miracle of God's love. As we hide Easter eggs for our children, our grandchildren, or even our great grandchildren, and help them search through the green and purple Easter grass for the last sticky marshmallow chick and a handful of jelly beans, let us not forget the gift that God gave us. As Jesus said in the third chapter of the Gospel of John, verse 16:  
   For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  
   These are powerful words, and they are often used as words of persuasion, to bring others to Christ. God gave His only begotten Son ..... for us! What a powerful love that is! 
   While the Senate is in recess and the schools are closed for ``spring break,'' I hope that those who are listening will take this time to recall this miracle of Easter. I continue to believe that the warp and woof of this great Nation are the deeply rooted religious beliefs of its people. Our religious beliefs, though diverse, our common faith in the Creator, remind all of us to look for the greater good, the higher, better part of ourselves and of others. The lessons differ, but the message is the same. Let us love one another. The resurrection of Jesus is the basis for the Christian belief that not only Jesus, but all Christians, will triumph over death. In closing, I recall the words of William Jennings Bryan and his thoughts concerning Proof of Immortality:  
   If the Father deigns to touch with divine power the cold and pulseless heart of the buried acorn and to make it burst forth from its prison walls, will He leave neglected in the earth the soul of man, made in the image of his Creator? If He stoops to give to the rosebush, whose withered blossoms float upon the autumn breeze, the sweet assurance of another springtime, will He refuse the words of hope to the sons of men when the frosts of winter come? If matter, mute and inanimate, though changed by the forces of nature into a multitude of forms, can never be destroyed, will the imperial spirit of man suffer annihilation when it has paid a brief visit like a royal guest to this tenement of clay? No, I am sure that He who, notwithstanding His apparent prodigality, created nothing without a purpose, and wasted not a single atom in all His creation, has made provision for a future life in which man's universal longing for immortality will find its realization. I am as sure that we live again as I am sure that we live today.  
   Mr. President, let us celebrate these words of hope this Easter season. The tomb is empty and the soul of man will never, never die. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Then, ordinarily, when we have controlled time like this, we might go to this side. If that is the case, I will yield for 8 minutes to the Senator from Virginia.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, why don't we go in accordance with the times the Senators came to the floor and sat down and expected to be recognized? When I first came, Mr. VOINOVICH had been waiting and the Senator from Alaska was speaking. I was the next on the floor. I will be happy to yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Virginia.

   Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I also thank Mr. VOINOVICH for the fine statement he made. I thank him for his courage in taking the position he has today. It isn't easy for him, but I thank him for his solid support of the position I take today. I think he is right, as I think I am right. 
   Mr. President, just 5 days ago, during consideration of this year's Budget Resolution, the Senate, by a vote of 65 yeas to 35 nays, expressed the Senate's opposition to either a temporary or permanent repeal of Federal gasoline taxes. In addition to myself, the original co-sponsors of the amendment were Senators WARNER, BAUCUS, VOINOVICH, LAUTENBERG and BOND. Additional co-sponsors added during the debate were Senators LINCOLN, DOMENICI, BINGAMAN and ROBB. Later today, the Senate will be asked to vote again on essentially the same question, when the cloture vote is taken on S. 2285. That bill would implement a temporary repeal of a portion of the Federal tax on gasoline. To make up for the lost revenues to the Highway Trust Fund that this gas tax repeal would cause, the proponents of this bill advocate the use of revenues from the General Fund of the Treasury. The proponents do not identify a particular source of those revenues. One has to assume that the replenishment of the Highway Trust Fund will either come from the non-Social Security surplus, or from cuts in spending in other areas of the budget, such as education, or if it turns out that there is no non-Social Security surplus, then this bill could cause us to have to return to deficit spending. That would be true, particularly if the Republican tax cut package is enacted, and if the projections of the Congressional Budget Office turn out to be faulty. I, for one, cannot support any proposition such as this, which takes the ``trust'' out of the Highway Trust Fund and could mandate unidentified cuts in other Federal programs. We must not backfill the potholes this bill will leave in funding for adequate maintenance of roads and bridges with money from education, veterans programs or other vital needs. 
   The proponents of S. 2285 have attempted to downplay the aforementioned vote that was taken on the Budget Resolution against any repeal of Federal gasoline taxes. That amendment to the Budget Resolution, which as I have said, was adopted by a vote of 65 yeas to 35 nays, contained the following language, ``Any effort to reduce the federal gasoline tax or de-link the relationship between highway user fees and highway spending, poses a great danger to the integrity of the Highway Trust Fund, and the ability of the states to invest adequately in our transportation infrastructure.'' 
   Yet, Mr. President, S. 2285 would in fact de-link the relationship between highway user fees and highway spending. In that respect, S. 2285 poses a great danger to the integrity of the Highway Trust Fund, and thereby, threatens to undermine the ability of the States to invest adequately in our nation's transportation infrastructure. 
   In I Corinthians 14:8, we are told, ``If the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who will prepare to the battle?'' When it comes to our Federal investment in our Nation's highways, S. 2285 would give a most uncertain sound. This bill would cut revenues to the Highway Trust Fund by repealing a portion of Federal gasoline taxes. Yet, just two years ago, in 
   landmark legislation, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, TEA-21, our State and local governments were told that we had put the ``trust'' back into the Highway Trust Fund, and that we had established an automatic mechanism to distribute all gasoline taxes to the states for their highway needs. In so doing, we committed ourselves to retaining the ``trust'' in the Highway Trust Fund forevermore. Now we come along and have a different sound coming from those who trumpet S. 2285. They want to cut Federal gasoline taxes and place in jeopardy the funding stream that we promised to the States in TEA-21. In return for these lost revenues, they would have us adopt a new promise, a promise that we will make up those lost gas tax revenues from the General Fund surpluses or from cutting funding for other vital national investments. The very reason that funding ``guarantees'' were included in TEA-21 was to eliminate the uncertainty surrounding our national highway program. We said that all highway user fees--the Federal gasoline taxes which the American people pay every time they go to the gas pump--would automatically go to the States so that our Governors, highway commissioners, and State and local officials would have a predictable funding stream to meet their critical highway funding needs. 
   The goal of TEA-21 was to reverse decades of disinvestment in our national highway infrastructure. The use of our national highway system continues to grow dramatically. In the 15 years, from 1983 to 1998, according to the Federal Highway Administration, the number of vehicle miles traveled on our Nation's highways, has grown from 1.65 trillion miles per year to over 2.62 trillion miles per year. However, our Nation's investment in highways has not come close to keeping pace with this increased traffic. The percent of vehicle miles traveled has been dropping almost every year since we initiated the interstate highway system during the Eisenhower Administration. They dropped steadily until 1997--the most recent year for which data is available. 
   What has this disinvestment done to the condition of our nation's roads? It has led to a national network of roadways with inadequate pavement conditions. Less then half the miles of roadway in rural America are considered to be in good or very good condition. Of the road miles in rural America, 56.5 percent are in fair to poor condition. Conditions are even worse in urban America, where 64.6 percent of road miles are considered to be in some level of disrepair, and only 35.4 percent of urban roadways are considered to be in good or very good condition. The situation is no better when we turn our attention to the nation's highway bridges. According to the most recent data from the Federal Highway Administration, 28.8 percent of our nation's bridges are either functionally obsolete  or structurally deficient. In urban America, 32.5 percent of the bridges are either functionally obsolete or structurally deficient. We are talking about a basic issue of safety here. It is an issue that cannot be ignored in the name of short-term, feel-good tax cut proposals. 
   Total highway spending by all levels of Government currently equals $41.8 billion annually. However, if we wanted to spend a sufficient sum to simply maintain the current inadequate condition of our national highways and bridges, we would need to spend $9 billion more per year, or $50.8 billion. In order to maintain the current average trip time between destinations, we would have to spend $26.1 billion more per year, or a total of $67.9 billion annually on our Nation's highways. Put another way, Mr. President, as a Nation, we would have to increase highway spending by more than 62 percent each year, simply to prevent traffic congestion from getting any worse. Yet, S. 2285 would place even the present levels of highway spending in jeopardy. 
   Highway congestion is worsening each and every year in cities, as well as rural communities across America. In the last 15 years, use by motorists of our highways on a per lane basis increased by more than 46 percent. This increased use has led to record levels of congestion. That congestion and the time that motorists spend in traffic jams is a continual and ever-growing drag on our national economy. Whether it's commuters stuck in traffic jams going to or from their jobs, or trucks that are delayed in delivering their products to their destinations, the costs to the nation are tremendous, and growing. In 1982, it was estimated that congestion cost our economy $21.6 billion. Between 1982 and 1997, that figure increased over 234 percent to $72.2 billion per year. That is $72 billion in wasted fuel, wasted time, and lost prosperity, not to mention the untold pollution that is caused by daily traffic congestion, particularly in our Nation's largest cities. 
   It is for these reasons, Mr. President, that I urge my colleagues to again reject this effort to temporarily repeal Federal gasoline taxes. Gasoline prices are too high, even though we have recently seen a decline in prices at the pump. However, there is no assurance whatsoever, that reduced Federal gasoline taxes, if enacted, would result in reduced gasoline prices at the gas pump. I find that proposition highly doubtful. In any case, I believe that the enactment of S. 2285 would cause grave danger both to the integrity to the Highway Trust Fund and to our ability to meet these huge and ever-growing highway needs. 
   I urge my colleagues to keep the commitments we made in TEA-21 and vote against cloture on S. 2285. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in response to the inquiry from the senior Senator from Virginia, Mr. WARNER, I would like to pass on my views on the intent and impact of Section 1(f)(4) of S. 2285. This provision, as Senator WARNER pointed out, is indeed unprecedented in the history of the law governing the Highway Trust Fund. As I read this provision, it is an attempt to make up for the losses in deposits that would occur to both the Highway and Airport and Airway Trust Funds as a result of a reduced fuel tax in this bill with transfers from the general fund of the Treasury. As has been pointed out by other Senators during debate on this bill, the legislation does not state with specificity how this diversion of general funds is to occur. It is not clear whether these general funds would be derived from the non-Social Security surplus or be required to be diverted from other areas of federal spending. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I would like to recognize the excellent staff work of Ann Loomis of Senator WARNER's staff, Ellen Stein of Senator VOINOVICH's staff, Tracy Henke of Senator BOND's staff, Mitch Warren of Senator LAUTENBERG's staff, Tom Sliter and Dawn Levy of Senator BAUCUS' staff, as well as Peter Rogoff, of my Appropriations Committee staff, on this effort.

   Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, we are seeing bad, bad go to worse. There are many things that can 
    be said about the way this Senate is operating with respect to budget resolutions. Vote-arama is bad enough, but now to ask the Senate to take all of these amendments in bloc is just asking too much. I do not say this critically of the distinguished Senator from New Mexico. He has a tough assignment, and he does it well. He is trying to accommodate a lot of Senators here. I would personally be willing to take him at his word. But this is no way to legislate. 
   I will not be a part of gang rape of the legislative process. That is what this has become. If we are going to do all these amendments--I did not count them; I do not know how many amendments there may be here--but if we are going to do all of these just by voice vote, pig in a poke, just so we can get out--and I want to get out, too--then why shouldn't we have done it at the start of the process? Why have we gone through all this rigamarole voting on these matters? If we come to the end and we still have two-thirds of the amendments left undone, and we are just going to say: OK, let's go home; we will accept them all, sight unseen, and let them go to conference--I am not going to be a part of that, Mr. President. So I object.

   We can stay here this evening. We can come back tomorrow. We can come back Monday and finish voting on the amendments. We do not have to legislate in this fashion. I am just not going to be a part of it. I may earn the enmity of every Senator in this body, but I am keeping a good relationship with my own conscience on this. We are seeing the legislative process go downhill in this Senate.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, 2 years ago Congress enacted landmark transportation legislation, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. In that legislation we restored the trust to the highway trust fund and we set forth highway funding levels that State and local governments could expect to receive over the 6-year life of TEA-21. 
   There are efforts now to reduce the gas tax revenues going into the highway trust fund, thereby endangering the promises we have made regarding funding levels for the Nation's highways and bridges. 
   This amendment puts the Senate on record in opposition to any efforts to repeal or to reduce gas tax revenues, either temporarily or permanently. In adopting this amendment, the Senate will confirm the position that it took in enacting TEA-21, that all gas tax revenues should go to the States for critical transportation infrastructure needs and that we meant it when we said we were restoring the ``trust'' to the highway trust fund. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to thank the 64 Senators who joined this morning in making an affirmative statement in opposition to any reduction in the gasoline tax. The vote this morning on– the Byrd-Warner-Baucus-Voinovich-Lautenberg-Bond amendment represented a defining victory for those Senators that want to keep the ``trust'' in the Highway Trust Fund and assure that every penny of highway spending is backed up by fuel taxes deposited into that Trust Fund. It was a defeat for any effort to reduce the gas tax or substitute gas tax revenues with general revenues in the distribution of federal highway funds. 
   I especially want to thank the original cosponsors of my amendment who joined with me to protect the Highway Trust Fund. It is no coincidence that all of these original cosponsors are members of the Environment and Public Works Committee that has jurisdiction over the Trust Fund. They are the experts in this area. They know better than anyone the threat that is posed by reckless proposals to alter the funding stream to the Trust Fund. They know better than anyone that monkeying around with the funding stream to the Trust Fund poses great danger to our ability to provide our states, counties and cities with a consistent, predictable and growing allocation of federal dollars for the repair and expansion of their highways and bridges. 
   During the debate over the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, Senator JOHN WARNER served as the Chairman of the Surface Transportation Subcommittee. Senator MAX BAUCUS served as the Ranking Member of that subcommittee as well as the full Environment and Public Works Committee. It would be impossible to overemphasize the contributions those two Senators made to that landmark legislation. Senator WARNER PERMANENTLY ALTERED THE LONG-STANDING DEBATE OVER SO-CALLED ``DONOR'' STATES BY GUARANTEEING EACH STATE A FAIR RETURN ON ITS INVESTMENT TO THE TRUST FUND. SENATOR BAUCUS saw to it that the legislation recognized the unique circumstances of the rural Western states, those states with relatively few citizens but a great many miles of highway. When Senator GRAMM of Texas and I developed an amendment to assure that the 4.3 cent gas tax would be fully spent on highway construction, we were just two non-Committee members with a good idea. When Senators WARNER and BAUCUS agreed to join as original cosponsors and lend their prestige and expertise to our amendment, our good idea became a genuine movement that garnered 54 co-sponsors and would eventually result in our adding close to $26 billion in guaranteed spending to the highway bill. 
   Senator VOINOVICH was not in the Senate during the debate over TEA-21. He was, however, one of the most outspoken governors on the importance of adequate transportation funding. He has been diligently attentive to transportation issues since he assumed the Chairmanship of the Surface Transportation Subcommittee from Senator WARNER. I appreciate very much his leadership in this area. 
   Senator LAUTENBERG, like Senator BOND, has the unique role of serving on both the Environment and Public Works Committee and the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee. Indeed, Senator LAUTENBERG has served either as the Chairman or the Ranking Member of that subcommittee for more than a dozen years. As such, his name is always at the center of every transportation debate. He represents the most congested state in the nation and, as such, has been a national leader in protecting and expanding our nation's rail and transit systems. Senator BOND should be credited for his longstanding efforts at streamlining the environmental review processes that govern our highway construction enterprise. As a Senator from  a mountainous state that is sorely in need of improved highways, I applaud his efforts at ensuring that our highways can be built more expeditiously but in an environmentally friendly manner. 
   Mr. President, our victory this morning was the result of the leadership of these fine Senators as well as the efforts of our other cosponsors--Senators ROBB, BINGAMAN, REID, LINCOLN, and others. It was a victory for every American that drives on our nation's highways. It was a victory for the integrity of the Highway Trust Fund. It was a defeat for any proposal to de-link our federal highway spending from the level of gas tax revenues.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, let me preface my remarks by saying I had joined with Senator STEVENS in two amendments that were at the desk earlier, one dealing with section 208, and one dealing with section 210. 
   I understand both of those have been modified. I still want to speak, however, to the subject matter here. In doing so, may I say I have no closer friend in this body than Senator STEVENS. It has been that way, and it is going to continue to be that way. He is chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and I think I have supported him throughout all the time he has been chairman, 
   and he has certainly been a great supporter of mine. He is the chairman; I am not. He carries some responsibilities that I do not carry at this moment. So what I have to say is not to be perceived as any criticism of TED STEVENS. I hope no one will perceive it as that, and I hope he will not. I merely want to speak to the subject matter of the two sections we were about to strike and to say why I am opposed to those two sections. I want to make that case for at least my side of the aisle, and I want to make it for the people out there who are watching. I do not bear any rancor toward anyone on the other side of the aisle, but I think these things ought to be said. 
   I rise, Mr. President, to speak about the two amendments we would have offered. The first of our amendments would have stricken section 208 of the budget resolution. That section would establish a 60-vote point of order in the Senate against the use of an emergency designation in any spending or revenue legislation. 
   Senators will recall that last year's Senate budget resolution contained a simple majority point of order against any emergency designations on all discretionary spending--both defense and nondefense. But, when the budget resolution last year came out of the conference with the House, the Senate provision had been changed. The conference agreement on last year's budget resolution did away with the simple majority point of order and replaced it with a 60-day point of order on nondefense discretionary spending only! The conferees chose to eliminate the point of order for defense emergency spending altogether. When the conference agreement on last year's budget resolution came back to the Senate, there was no way to attack that particular provision. Budget resolution conference reports are limited as to time and, therefore, filibuster proof. The Budget Act sets a time limit on their consideration, after which a final vote will occur. The majority had the votes to adopt that conference agreement, and did so. That is why, for fiscal year 2000, we have the ridiculous and totally unjustifiable requirements on emergency spending. 
   Let me say that again, Mr. President. When the budget resolution last year was acted upon by the Senate, it had a simple majority vote point of order, but when it went to conference with the Members of the other body, it came back to us with a 60-vote point of order. The House conferees had a voice in changing that point of order by which the Senate has had to live in the intervening time. 
   I think our Members ought to be fully aware of that. It did not leave the Senate floor last year with a 60-vote point of order. It went to the conference with the other body, and they helped to change the rules, if I may use that term, by which we have to live. They are not bound by the 60-vote point of order, but we are. It came back to us in the conference report which we could not change. 
   We ought to be aware of those things when we send these resolutions to the other body. I do not blame the other body. I am not criticizing them. They may actually have had nothing to do with it, but it was changed in conference. 
   Here is the perfectly ridiculous aspect of this 60-vote point of order requirement under which we have to live here. If your constituents suffer from any of the myriad natural disasters that can occur at any time, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, or any other catastrophe--maybe an act of God--emergency spending for the relief of those constituents is subject to a 60-vote point of order in the Senate. The House has no such supermajority point of order. 
   In the Senate for fiscal year 2000, if any Senator wishes to raise a point of order against emergency spending in the 
   nondefense area, it will take 60 votes, or that emergency spending will be deleted from any appropriations bill or conference report thereon. 
   For example, if the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. INOUYE, has a catastrophe, if there is an act of God that is visited upon his State, he may be perfectly justified in asking for an emergency appropriation to deal with that catastrophe. But in the Senate, a 60-vote point of order will lie against that funding for the relief of his State, and 41 Members of the Senate can deny him and deny his people relief. God forbid that any catastrophe should hit his State, or the State of the Senator from Nevada who is sitting before me. If his State is suddenly hit by a catastrophe and they need disaster relief, 41 Members, a minority in the Senate, can say no, and the people of Nevada would be denied that relief. 
   In other words, we can send our brave men and women in uniform around the world, whether it be to Bosnia or to Kosovo or to Iraq or anywhere else, and provide emergency funding to pay for those operations, regardless of the costs, without facing a point of order against such spending. But when it comes to helping the people at home, the constituents who send us here, when it comes to helping them in their dire extremities that have been brought on by an act of God, no, a point of order can be made against that funding, and it would take 60 votes for those people in that disaster-stricken State to get relief. 
   That is preeminently unfair. One can say what one wants, but that is unfair. I cannot understand why anyone would want to insist on a point of order that would require 60 votes when it comes to helping the people who send us here, the people who pay the taxes. 
   We should not unduly hamstring spending intended to cover either defense or nondefense emergencies. 
   While we have discretionary spending caps in the law, provisions must be made to deal with the unexpected. And we should not encumber the flexibility to answer those emergency needs with parliamentary devices which make responding to them difficult. 
   I should point out, Mr. President, that, as chairman of the Appropriations Committee during the time of the 1990 budget summit and as a participant in that summit, I worked very hard to include the exemption for emergency spending that is now contained in section 251(b)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act. That 1990 budget summit between the Bush administration and Congress was necessary in order to avoid huge across-the-board sequesters of Federal spending that would have otherwise occurred under Gramm-Rudman. Those sequesters, or automatic across-the-board cuts, were in the magnitude of 40 percent, and could have  devastated the Nation. And so, we had no choice but to reach an agreement. In the end, after months of negotiations both here in Congress and at Andrews Air Force Base, an agreement was finally reached and subsequently enacted by Congress and signed by President Bush. 
   An important feature of the 1990 budget agreement was that, for the first time, statutory caps were placed on discretionary spending. As a participant in those negotiations, I was intimately involved in the setting of those discretionary spending caps and the other budgetary enforcement provisions contained in the 1990 budget summit agreement. In order to agree to those caps, I felt that it was critical that the Appropriations Committees be held ``harmless'' for economic and technical miscalculations that occur in each year's budget projections. In other words, if discretionary appropriations were to be held to a specific spending cap each year, that discretionary spending should not be automatically cut because of technical or economic miscalculations by either the Office of Management and Budget or the Congressional Budget Office.

   Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished minority whip. 
   This point of order is an unwise and cumbersome device that could prevent the committee from responding to the urgent needs of our Nation. Now, why do we want to do that? 
   The second amendment, which I joined in offering, would have stricken section 210 from the budget resolution. That section would reinstitute a congressional firewall on defense and nondefense discretionary spending for fiscal year 2001. This section of the budget resolution would set defense spending for fiscal year 2001 at $306,819,000,000 in new budget authority and $295,050,000,000 in outlays. For the nondefense category, the cap would be set at $289.7 billion in new budget authority and $327.5 billion in outlays. 
   In other words, this budget resolution would cap defense spending at a level that is $9 billion above what it would take to maintain this year's level of spending adjusted for inflation. But the cap for nondefense spending would be set at a level requiring a cut. The cap for nondefense spending--hear me now--the cap for nondefense spending would be set at a level requiring a cut of $19 billion in budget authority below this year's spending level. In other words, section 210 of the budget resolution now before the Senate would take away from the Appropriations Committee the ability to determine, through their committee markups, what the appropriate levels of defense spending or domestic spending should be. 
   Imagine that. How silly can we get? The Appropriations Committee is being prevented from using the judgment of its members, their expertise, to decide even the most basic levels of defense and domestic spending for this Nation. Instead, this budget resolution sets that figure. I have been on the Appropriations Committee now going on 42 years. That is longer than anybody has ever served. The budget resolution sets that figure for the Appropriations Committee prior to their even having finished their hearings. The Budget Committee will have usurped all of those decisions with the construction of these firewalls. 
   I believe this is unwarranted and unacceptable micromanagement on the part of some Members. I don't blame all of the members of the Budget Committee. I know they have their problems. I have great respect for the chairman of the Budget Committee. He has always been very fair to me. He sits on the Appropriations Committee likewise. He knows what this does to the Appropriations Committee. He is trying to do a good job and he does a splendid job. But a lot of these things, those who are in the driver's seat at a particular given moment have the votes, and those who would do otherwise, such as Senator STEVENS, in other cases, or Senator DOMENICI, they have to look at the votes. 
   I thought we had all learned our lesson about substituting structural devices for human judgment with the Gramm-Rudman experience. Setting up procedural barricades often creates more problems than are solved when it comes to funding real priorities for a vast and complex nation. Autopilot politics amounts to an abdication of our responsibility to debate and weigh reasonable alternatives, as we are expected to do and as we are elected to do by the people. 
   The distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, my good friend, Senator STEVENS, is one of the most knowledgeable experts in the history of the Senate when it comes to the funding needs of the Department of Defense. Do we have to squander his experience and the accumulated expertise of the members of the Appropriations Committee? Here sits one on my left, Senator INOUYE. He is on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee of the Senate. 
   Do we have to squander their experience, their accumulated expertise, by constructing these mindless, artificial firewalls which attempt to game the funding process before it is even begun? Well, these sections, I assure you, my fellow Senators, will greatly increase the difficulty faced by the Appropriations chairman in marking up and presenting to the Senate the 13 fiscal year 2001 appropriations bills. The speed and efficiency sought by all of us to get this essential work done will not be aided by these unwise and irresponsible budget barnacles. Let us scrape them off before they do their damage. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have left of my 9 minutes?

   Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I know that my remarks tonight will result in no favorable action that will override the die that has already been cast. I am confident of that. And to that extent, they were remarks made in futility. But for the record they were not futile. 
   I think that we should let the people know what is being done here. The people out there want us to use our best judgment in the Appropriations Committee and to have our hands free when it comes to appropriating funds for disaster. We can't foresee those. They may strike my State next. They may strike the State of any Senator who sits within the sound of my voice; they may be the next. In all my years, I have never voted against a dollar for any State that has been hit with a disaster, and I don't expect to ever do that. 
   I don't think we ought to be handcuffed and gagged and bound foot and hand when it comes to dealing with emergencies. Now we are going to have a supermajority thrust upon us. We have been laboring under that process. I had hoped that we could rid ourselves of those shackles--not for ourselves but for our people. Well, Mr. President, the wheel goes around and some day perhaps we will come to our senses and throw off these shackles and get back to where we are free agents and can act in the best interests of our constituents, without having to overcome supermajorities such as are being imposed upon us here.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment that the functional totals in this budget resolution do not assume the reduction of any Federal gasoline taxes on either a temporary or permanent basis. 
   Mr. President, in 1996, just four years ago, the Senate considered a proposal to repeal the 4.3 cent per gallon federal excise tax on gasoline. As I recall, the issue was debated in the midst of the 1996 presidential election, as gasoline  prices were on the rise. Today, we are considering a similar proposal under almost identical circumstances. American consumers are understandably upset about the rise of gasoline prices over the last year. In February 1999, average U.S. prices were under a dollar per gallon. Since then, the average price for gasoline in the United States has increased by about 55 cents per gallon. To make matters worse, the U.S. government has had to go hat-in-hand to the Gulf nations to beg them to produce more oil. Let us all remember that these are the very same Gulf states that the U.S. defended during Operation Desert Storm in 1991. In answer to the outrage of the American people over this latest hike in gas prices, we see, yet again, a proposal for a reduction in the federal excise tax on gasoline. 
   The repeal of any tax, particularly a tax on gasoline, is always politically popular, and quite a temptation for politicians, especially in the midst of a campaign season. Additionally, the temptation to remind the electorate of a tax increase approved by a political opponent is close to irresistible in an election year. However, in our rush to craft a pseudo-solution to a real concern in this election year, I hope that the Senate will carefully consider the long-term implications of its actions. To suggest that the 4.3 cent per gallon gasoline tax enacted in 1993 is the precursor of all this pain at the gas pump, and that the cure for that pain is a simple repeal of that tax, is pure and utter folly. 
   A look at the markets over recent months shows that gasoline prices have risen because of the basic economic forces of supply and demand. First, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) successfully agreed last year to curb crude-oil production in order to raise exceptionally low per-barrel prices--such low per-barrel prices that U.S. producers were in danger of being put out of business. Second, U.S. crude-oil inventories were allowed to fall to dangerously low levels in 1999. Because there was no cushion from U.S. inventories to respond to the cuts in oil production, gasoline prices, naturally, increased. What we are seeing is classic supply and demand at work. 
   OPEC agreed last week to increase oil production, but that oil will not arrive from the Gulf states for at least another one to two months. In the meantime, there is a more or less fixed supply of oil available for U.S. consumption. This short-supply scenario means that even if the excise tax were repealed, gasoline prices would likely increase again, reflecting, guess what, the classic lack of equilibrium between supply and demand. In other words, there is no getting around the basic tenets of the problem, which are OPEC's cutbacks on production and low U.S. crude-oil inventories. 
   Yet, some of my colleagues would have the American consumer believe that this tax cut proposal will effect a miracle cure. Faith in snake oil never seems to diminish in the Halls of Congress. They argue that we can get around the laws of supply and demand altogether by simply reducing the gas tax. I, for one, am doubtful that consumers would significantly benefit from this latest attempt to treat a serious malady with a political placebo. 
   As I have said, over the past few months, gasoline prices on average have risen by about 55 cents per gallon across the nation. S. 2285, would roll back the price of gasoline to the American consumer by only 4 cents, and only until the end of this calendar year. If average U.S. prices increase to two dollars per gallon, this proposal would repeal the entire excise tax for this calendar year, which is still a reduction of only 18 cents per gallon. Assuming that these prices actually filter down to the consumer--a rather large leap of faith--how significant a difference will a 4 cent decrease be compared to a 55 cent increase in gasoline prices? Likewise, if prices reach as high as two dollars per gallon, will 18 cents make a noticeable difference in the average consumer's weekly expenses? 
   As I mentioned before, supporters of the proposal to repeal a portion of the gas tax 
   assume that the tax decrease would filter down to the consumer. But there is no guarantee that any savings whatsoever will be passed on to the consumer. Since this proposal does not address the low supply of oil in the United States, the benefits of the tax cut are likely to flow to the coffers of the domestic oil-refinery industry, not to the pockets of the consumer. As I mentioned before, even though refineries would be paying less in taxes to the federal government, lower prices at the pump would drive up demand for gas, further reducing supply and increasing the price for the remaining scarce gasoline. Until oil supplies in the United States increase, gasoline will continue to be scarce and prices at the pump will continue to climb, regardless of whether or not the federal excise tax is reduced. 
   OPEC is also more likely to benefit from this proposal than the American consumer. Let us consider this proposal from OPEC's point of view for a moment. Gasoline prices can only rise so high before American demand begins to wane. Decreased demand means lower profits for OPEC, which is why OPEC agreed to increase oil production last week in Vienna. Stable prices are in the long-term interest of OPEC. This tax repeal proposal, however, would remove the incentive for OPEC to maintain stable oil prices. If the Congress chooses to cut the gasoline tax to reduce gasoline prices, it would effectively allow OPEC to maintain artificially low production quotas, and thus support artificially high prices, without suffering from the decrease in oil demand that the free market would otherwise dictate. A reduction in the gas tax removes the economic incentive for OPEC to keep oil production in equilibrium with demand. 
   Mr. President, the economics of this proposal notwithstanding, it is also important to consider the impact it would have on transportation spending, since the excise tax revenues are intended to be reserved for maintaining and improving the Nation's highways. Spring is here, and on highways and roadways across the Nation, spring is an event marked by the thump and rumble of tires hitting potholes and crumbling medians. 
   Mr. President, just three years ago, the Senate considered the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, or TEA-21. At that time, the Senate debated at length the appropriate mechanism to finance the needs of our Nation's infrastructure. I, along with many of my colleagues, was determined to reverse the trend begun in the early 1980's of federal disinvestment in our Nation's infrastructure. During the debate on TEA-21, I, along with my colleagues Senator GRAMM, Senator BAUCUS, and Senator WARNER, championed an amendment that would allow the revenue from the 4.3 cent gas tax imposed in 1993 to be used for highway construction. Just the year before, Senator GRAMM had succeeded in seeing to it that the 4.3 cent tax was deposited into the Highway Trust Fund. The Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment during TEA-21 was to ensure that the new revenue to the Trust Fund would, indeed, be spent on highways as it was intended, and as we informed the American people it would be. 
   Mr. President, our amendment gathered no fewer than 54 cosponsors on a broad bipartisan basis--29 Democrats and 25 Republicans. The entire debate on the highway bill was characterized by bipartisanship. Back then, we heard talk about all the highway needs that were going unmet across our Nation and how the revenue of the 4.3 cent gas tax could help address those needs. 
   Indeed, during the debate on TEA-21, an amendment was offered to repeal the 4.3 cent gas tax. By a vote of 80 to 18, the Senate refused--refused!--to waive the Budget Act to consider that amendment. Senator MACK's proposal was appropriately rejected by the overwhelming majority of Republicans and the overwhelming majority of Democrats. On that day, March 11, 1998, the 4.3 cent tax was the difference between a highway bill that continued the status quo of disinvestment and a highway bill that made real progress in repairing our deteriorated highways. With the adoption of the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment, the final highway bill that passed the Senate two days later was almost $26 billion larger than the bill reported by the Environment and Public Works Committee. And that $26 billion figure was derived directly from the Congressional Budget Office's estimate at that time of the expected revenue of the 4.3 cent gas tax. 
   Mr. President, I have offered an amendment to the budget resolution, on behalf of several of my colleagues whose names I mentioned earlier, which states that it is the sense of the Senate that the Federal gas tax should not be repealed on either a temporary or a permanent basis. I am pleased to be joined in that amendment by five distinguished members of the Committee on Environment and Public Works; namely, Senators WARNER, BAUCUS, VOINOVICH, LAUTENBERG, and BOND; and, in addition, Senators REID and DOMENICI. 
   This amendment provides the Senate an opportunity to vote, up or down, on the continued integrity of the Highway Trust Fund and the relative importance of infrastructure investment versus a short-term tax cut that may never be felt by the consumer. 
   The recent effort to repeal a portion of the gas tax attempts to create a political issue where there really should be none. Thankfully, Republican Senators like JOHN WARNER, GEORGE VOINOVICH, KIT BOND, and PETE DOMENICI are not being baited by the hook of this foray into election year politics. Nor are senior House Members, including members of the House Republican Leadership, such as RICHARD ARMEY, J.C. WATTS, and House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman BUD SHUSTER. The nation's governors, the nation's mayors, the state legislatures, and the nation's county executives are not going for the bait either. The national associations representing all those elected officials, both Democrats and Republicans, are all opposed to efforts to repeal the gas tax. So is the ``Triple A'' whose sole responsibility is to the driving public that is paying the higher gas prices at the pump every day. So is the Association of General Contractors, the American Road and Transportation Builders Association, the American Public Transit Association, and scores of other groups. 
   For those of my colleagues who wish to portray this issue as a political one, let me remind them that less than a decade ago, a bill to raise gas taxes for deficit reduction was signed into law by George Bush--that is, with George Herbert Walker Bush. I was there at Andrews Air Force Base, across the table from OMB Director Richard Darman and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu. It was at that summit where a 5-cent gas tax increase was first discussed. I did not participate in the final negotiations over the revenue measures in that agreement since they were handled by the Chairmen of the Finance and Ways and Means Committees and their Ranking Members. At the end of those negotiations, the Bush Administration was supportive of raising the gas tax by 5 cents--with 2 1/2 cents being deposited into the Highway Trust Fund and 2 1/2 cents going to deficit reduction. So it was the Bush/Quayle Administration that first laid the groundwork for using gas taxes for deficit reduction in 1990. Thankfully, today, every penny of the federal gas tax is deposited in the Highway Trust Fund and spent on transportation investments across the nation. 
   Mr. President, S. 2285, as introduced by the Majority Leader, proposes to repeal 4.3 cents of the 18.4-cent federal gasoline tax. Since every penny of the gas tax is now distributed to the states in the form of annual obligations from the Highway Trust Fund, that repeal will put at risk more than $7.1 billion in transportation funding beginning in 2002. Now, $7.1 billion will fill a lot of potholes and fix a lot of crumbling roadways. Under this bill, if the average price of gasoline reaches $2 or higher, then the entire 18.4-cent federal gas tax will be repealed, putting more than $30 billion in transportation funding at risk. 
   Additionally, there is some very unique language in S. 2285 that seeks to mandate that spending from the Highway Trust Fund be maintained at the levels authorized in TEA-21, notwithstanding the fact that this bill will keep revenue from coming into the Trust Fund. Does anyone truly believe that this is a workable approach? The Chairman of Surface Transportation Subcommittee, Senator VOINOVICH, clearly does not. Senator WARNER and Senator BAUCUS, who joined me in restoring the ``trust'' to the Highway Trust Fund, certainly do not. I implore all Members on both sides of the aisle to join us in rejecting a plan which will compromise that trust which would take the ``trust'' out of the Highway Trust Fund. 
   Mr. President, our highway and transit infrastructure can ill afford to forego several billion dollars in annual investment. Let me remind my colleagues that we have no reason to be proud of the current condition of our highways. According to the 
   Department of Transportation's most recent figures, the condition of our nation's highways and bridges continues to deteriorate by many measures. Daily usage of our highway system has continued to grow each and every year, such that more than half of our nation's urban interstate miles are now perpetually congested--more than half! Less than half of our rural highway miles and less than half of our urban highway miles are considered to be in good or very good condition. That means that more than half of our nation's highway miles are considered to be at some level of disrepair. So when you look at the condition of our nation's highway bridges, the situation is no better. Roughly one-third of our urban highway bridges are either structurally or functionally deficient. The same is true for roughly one-quarter of our rural highway bridges. This is not just a matter of insufficient capacity. This is a matter of safety. The Senate must not turn its back to these troubling facts. 
   It is quite appropriate that we are debating this issue as part of the budget resolution. Indeed, the Committee report accompanying the budget resolution parrots the assumptions contained in S. 2285. The report states that ``as part of a five year, $150 billion tax reduction package, the Committee-reported resolution could accommodate a suspension or repeal of the Clinton/Gore 4.3 cent tax increase on fuel.'' Mr. President, I believe we have reached the point where we must ask the Senate where it stands on just this question. This amendment provides that opportunity. 
   This is an election year. I understand that this proposal is being presented to the Congress for reasons which just might have very little to do with sound fiscal policy. The American people are not foolish. They will realize that this bill would have an unfortunate effect on transportation spending. They will not thank us for handing them more of the congested, crumbling commuter routes they must already deal with every day. Likewise, they will realize that such a short-term fix does nothing to address the underlying problem of high gas prices--namely OPEC and the lack of a national energy policy to protect the United States against the roller coaster ride of gasoline price adjustments. I urge my colleagues to reject this voodoo chant remedy. We might as well hire a witch doctor to shake a tambourine over the heads of the OPEC states as adopt this approach. Our energy problems demand serious remedies, not pseudo-solutions. Vote against this bill for the people, the commuters, the truck drivers and the ambulance and bus drivers, of America. We need a serious look at the totality of our national energy policy, not a quick fix non-remedy that will only result in more broken promises and broken pavement for the American driving public.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it has been said that the more things change, the more they stay the same. We are warned by the American philosopher George Santayana (1863-1952) that, ``those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.'' Those words of warning, I think, are appropriate to have in mind as the Senate debates the Fiscal Year 2001 Budget Resolution. 
   It was less than two decades ago that the Nation inaugurated a new President, who campaigned on a pledge to cut taxes, cut federal spending except for defense, and pay down the Federal debt. The so-called ``Reagan Revolution'' was based on the supply-side economic ideology that massive tax cuts would generate large increases in revenues to the Federal Treasury, sufficient to allow a large build-up in military spending; while, at the same time, balancing the Federal budget. That was the blueprint--the budgetary plan of the Reagan-Bush Administration. To be sure, there were those who doubted that this supply-side program would achieve the results that were projected in the Reagan-Bush budget. Indeed, during his campaign against Reagan for the GOP nomination, Mr. Bush called Reagan's supply-side economic plan ``voodoo economics.'' Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker called the Reagan-Bush budget blueprint a ``riverboat gamble.'' 
   Despite those ominous warnings in 1981, Congress did enact a massive tax cut, and Congress increased the military budget. But, entitlement spending continued to grow, while projected increases in revenues did not materialize. As a result, the Reagan-Bush Director of the Office of Management and Budget, David Stockman, resorted to what amounted to ``cooking the books'' in the annual Reagan-Bush budgets. Mr. Stockman, I believe, was the person who came up with the strategy, later termed ``Rosy Scenario'' to describe the fanciful budget forecasts during his service as OMB Director. 
   As a result of those budgetary policies, rather than being able to pay down the federal debt, or even to reduce deficit spending, the twelve Reagan-Bush years brought the Nation the largest annual deficits in its history and, consequently, the Federal debt grew to levels that endangered the Nation's economic prosperity. 
   In fact, as this chart entitled ``National Debt'' shows, on the day that Mr. Reagan was sworn into office on January 20, 1981, the national debt stood at $932 billion. As Mr. Reagan alluded in his State of the Union Address that year, it would take a 63-mile high stack of one dollar bills to equal $932 billion. 
   That $932 billion represented the debt that had been accumulated through all of the previous administrations from George Washington's administration, the first administration, on down through those years. 
   What was the fiscal health of the Nation when this supply-side fiscal conservative, President Reagan left office? As shown on the chart, on January 20, 1989, the day that Mr. Reagan left office and Mr. Bush was sworn in to succeed him, the Nation's debt was some two trillion, six hundred and eighty three billion dollars. It took the Nation over 200 years to get to $1 trillion in national debt. It took the Reagan-Bush Administration just 8 years to nearly triple the national debt--from $932 billion on the day Mr. Reagan took office to $2.683 trillion on the day he left office. 
   Let me say that again. From $932 billion on the day that Mr. Reagan took office to $2.683 trillion on the day he left office. 
   In other words, the stack of $1 bills, which was supposed to be 63 miles high, as Mr. Reagan spoke to a nationally televised audience, an accumulation through all of the administrations prior to the Reagan administration--that stack of $1 bills he portrayed very vividly, I recall, as being 63 miles high--on the day he left office, that stack of $1 bills would be 182 miles into the stratosphere. 
   Then, we had the Bush-Quayle Administration for the next four years. Did that Administration make progress in reducing deficit spending and begin to pay down the national debt? Unfortunately, such was not the case. The national debt just kept right on going. It was as if someone were feeding it growth hormones! The debt reached over $4 trillion by the time Mr. Bush was voted out of office and President Clinton was sworn in on January 20, 1993. 
   That stack of $1 bills then as represented by the national debt would have been 277 miles high. In other words, it had grown from 63 miles high at the beginning of the Reagan administration to 277 miles high at the end of the Reagan-Bush administration. 
   Supporters of the Reagan and Bush Administrations, over the years, have attempted to lay the blame for this massive increase in debt at the doorstep of Congress, claiming that Congress holds the purse strings. I have two responses. First, during the first 6 of the 8 years of the Reagan Presidency, the Republicans were in the Majority in the United States Senate. Second, during the entire 12 years of the Reagan and Bush Administrations, only a handful of times did President Reagan veto an appropriations bill for containing too much funding; and President Bush did not do so even once. Furthermore, the total of all the appropriations bills during the 12 years of the Reagan/Bush and Bush/Quayle Presidencies amounted to more than $60 billion in cuts below the budget requests of both Presidents. 
   Since the Presidencies of Reagan and Bush, the fiscal condition of the Nation has greatly improved, for a myriad of reasons. Among those are the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, and the great increases in productivity of the American workforce and in our industries. Some of the credit, I believe, can also rightly be attributed to the Federal budgetary policies of the past several years. The deficit reduction packages of 1990, 1993, and 1997 set out very stringent targets on Federal spending, which helped reduce deficits to the point that in 1998, we enjoyed the first unified budget surplus in 30 years--a surplus of $69 billion. 
   Both of the latest OMB and Congressional Budget Office forecasts project huge federal budget surpluses far into the future. The CBO now projects unified budget surpluses ranging from $3.2 trillion to more than $4.2 trillion, over the next 10 years, depending on spending levels under various scenarios. 
   Of those 10-year surpluses, some $2.3 trillion will be generated by contributions into the Social Security Trust Fund, in excess of the payments to retirees over the period of Fiscal Years 2001-2010. There is virtually unanimous agreement that any and all Social Security surpluses over the next 10 years should go toward reducing the national debt, rather than being spent. This means that, if CBO's projections turn out to be correct, the national debt would go down by more than $2 trillion over the next 10 fiscal years. 
   The question, then, is what to do with any remaining, or non-Social Security surpluses over the next 10 years. Should we cut spending further; should we maintain spending at current levels; or should we increase spending? Should we use some of the non-Social Security surpluses to pay down the debt, and perhaps even eliminate the publicly held debt by 2031? Or, should we enact  huge tax cuts that eat up all of the projected non-Social Security surpluses? 
   Unfortunately, Mr. President, the Budget Resolution now before the Senate, as was the case last year, chooses the worst possible fiscal course for the Nation. This Budget Resolution proposes a huge tax cut, which would drain the Treasury of more than $150 billion over the next 5 years, and could easily cost in excess of $800 billion over the next 10 years. Combining that size tax cut with the resulting increase in interest payments on the debt that it would cost, could drain the Treasury of as much as $950 billion over 10 years. That figure is larger than the total $893 billion in non-Social Security surpluses that CBO has projected for the next 10 years. 
   What that means is that, in order to pay for the tax cut in this fiscal blueprint, we will either have to go back to deficit spending, or raid the Social Security Trust Fund. That is assuming the CBO projected surpluses actually occur. Is that likely? What has been the record of CBO projections in the past? Have their projections been fairly close to what actually occurred? The answer is ``no.'' Not so close as to enact tax cuts that would use up all of the CBO projected surpluses, and then some. In fact, over the period of 1980 through 1998, the CBO projections of revenues contained in budget resolutions were off by an absolute average of $38 billion per year! Over 5 years, that is $190 billion, Similarly, the CBO's deficit projections erred by an absolute average of $54 billion per year over the period of 1980-1998. 
   Like last year, the tax cuts proposed in this budget resolution are unwise in the extreme. The American people won't buy this plan. They are not clamoring for tax cuts. The American people have learned that locking in huge tax cuts before the money to pay for them has materialized is just plain, old, common, country gambling. They want to make sure that the money is there before we mandate huge tax cuts. The people don't wont to go back into debt, with the interest charged to them. 
   Now, let's turn to discretionary spending. That's the portion of the Federal budget that is funded in the annual appropriations bills. Discretionary appropriations amount to about one-third of the Federal budget and include spending for Defense, as well as a wide array of domestic investments, including education, health, veterans' medical care, highway and airport construction, parks and recreation, the FBI and other law enforcement agencies, water projects, environmental programs, Head Start, and the operational costs of all of the departments and agencies of the Executive Branch, as well as those of the Legislative Branch and the Judiciary. These are the programs that support the physical and human infrastructure of this Nation. 
   What is being proposed for the discretionary portion of the budget in this Budget Resolution? As this chart shows, this budget plan would increase spending for the military by $24 billion above what is required to maintain current levels, over the next five years. For all other discretionary spending, this budget plan would cut $105 billion, or 6.5%, over the next 5 years below what is needed to maintain current services, adjusted for inflation. 
   To get right to the point, let's look at what is being proposed in this Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2001. That is the fiscal year which will begin on October 1 of this year. This budget proposes budget authority totaling $597 billion for discretionary programs for the upcoming fiscal year. That is a cut of $10 billion below what will be needed to maintain this year's discretionary spending levels, adjusted for inflation. 
   It would take $607 billion just to keep up with inflation and avoid real cuts in discretionary spending for Fiscal Year 2001; only $597 billion is allowed in this budget resolution. Of that amount, what is allowed for Defense? The CBO tells us it would take $298 billion in budget authority to maintain this year's level of Defense spending. But, the Budget Resolution before the Senate would provide $307 billion--a real increase of $9 billion above what it would take to maintain this year's level of Defense spending, adjusted for inflation. 
   For all other discretionary programs, CBO says it would take $309 billion in budget authority to maintain this year's spending levels. This resolution provides only $290 billion, a cut of $19 billion in budget authority. Yet, at the same time, the budget resolution promises to increase funding for education, veterans' health care, and other popular initiatives. This means that all of the other unprotected programs will have to be cut even more in order to accommodate the protected ones. 
   What does that mean in real terms? For an example, let's take a look at national crime-fighting programs. According to the Office of Management and Budget, the Senate Budget Resolution does not appear to provide any funds for the hiring of additional police officers, or for community crime-prevention programs. For the Coast Guard, this budget resolution would severely impact their ability to carry out their missions in the areas of drug interdiction, national security, and fisheries enforcement. 
   Despite claims to the contrary, funding for education would be cut by more than $5 billion below the President's request in Fiscal Year 2001. This would require cuts of some 62,000 children from Head Start; and it would make it impossible to hire some 20,000 additional teachers for public schools or provide urgent repairs for some 5,000 schools across the Nation. 
   For Science, a reduction of this magnitude would result in more than 19,000 fewer researchers; educators and student receiving support from the National Science Foundation. It would appear that a lot of this rhetoric about protecting education is just that--rhetoric. 
   Is it realistic to suggest that the Nation's important domestic investment needs will be cut by almost $20 billion this year? Is that what we want to propose to the American people? I do not support any such proposition. To follow this budget plan will mean endorsing large permanent tax cuts, based on budget surplus projections which may or may not come to pass. If the tax cuts are enacted, they will be real. They will be in law. But, the money to pay for them may be only a figment of the forecasters' imaginations. The result may make it a virtual certainty that this flawed budget plan would lead the 
   Nation, once again, down the road of annual triple-digit billion dollar deficits. We slew that gremlin after the twelve Reagan-Bush years. Let us heed the warning of Santayana and not condemn ourselves and the American people to repeat those failed policies. Let the evil, bloated deficit monster sleep. 
   If we follow the plan before us today, we will probably see another in a series of session-ending omnibus appropriations negotiations with the White House. Such a process demeans the Congress, elevates the Executive, and allows the President's aides to sit at the table and become instant appropriators while Congress completes its appropriators' work. That process always reminds me of a high stakes poker game--``I'll see your veterans' programs and raise you five billion more for defense.'' Unfortunately, it is often the American taxpayer who ends up the loser. I implore my colleagues to reject this Budget Resolution. Let's get off this treadmill to nowhere. We should not give tax cuts with money we don't yet have, and may never have. To do so is like writing checks before the money is firmly in the bank. 
   In recent testimony before the Senate Special Committee on Aging, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan repeated his longstanding view that, ``The most effective means of raising the level of future resources, in my judgment, is to allow the budget surpluses projected in the coming years to be used to pay down the Nation's debt.'' I agree with Mr. Greenspan in that statement. We should adequately invest in our Nation's infrastructure needs and use the balance of future surpluses to pay down the Federal debt, thereby enhancing the ability of the Nation to be in the position to meet the future needs of both Social Security and Medicare. The American people, I believe, recognize the wisdom of such an approach. They instinctively realize that massive tax cuts at this time, based on flimsy projections and on promises to cut spending far below levels that could sustain the economy into the 21st century, are precisely the opposite of sound fiscal policy. The American people will not buy these Disney World policies anymore. They expect a fair deal in budgeting, and  this Senate should, as well. To fail to do so would amount to deja-voo-doo all over again! 
   I yield the floor. I thank the distinguished Senator from Minnesota for yielding to me.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we Americans are patriotic, and there are few acts more deeply offensive to us than the willful destruction of our flag. The flag, after all, is a unique symbol of national unity and a powerful source of national pride. 
   But the flag does not just represent the country and its history; in a very real sense it is a part of that history. Like the Constitution, the flag was handed down to us by the country's Founding Fathers, for it was the Second Continental Congress that, in 1777, established the Stars and Stripes as the national flag. From Tripoli in 1805 to Iwo Jima in 1945 to the Moon in 1969, the flag has been raised to commemorate some of America's proudest moments. 
   Millions of American men and women have marched off to battle behind that flag. 
   I see the flag there. It is just to the right of the Presiding Officer here in the Chamber. What a beautiful sight--that flag! 
   Millions more have sworn allegiance to the flag and ``to the republic for which it stands.'' And, while historians may dispute this point, schoolchildren to this day are taught to revere Betsy Ross for having sewn the first flag. Anyone who doubts either the flag's place in the country's history or the tremendous emotional ties that it inspires needs only to listen to the words of our national anthem, in which Francis Scott Key recalls with pride the sight of the Stars and Stripes flying proudly over Fort McHenry after a heavy bombing by British forces in 1814. Key's words are so familiar that we may scarcely think of them when we hear or sing them, but they are a deeply moving tribute to our flag. 
   In contemplation of the moment which is approaching when the Senate would again be confronted with a constitutional amendment concerning the desecration of the American flag, I have spent hours in discussions with constitutional scholars, with members of my staff, and in researching court decisions. I know of few subjects that have come before the Senate that have given me greater anguish. I know that the strong sentiment in West Virginia and throughout the country supports the amendment. I have voted for such a constitutional amendment in the past, but, based upon my deep and searching consideration of this matter, I have changed my mind and I will vote against S. J. Res. 14. In fact, it was my sad duty, on yesterday, to inform the members of The American Legion, gathered together here in Washington, that I could not be with them this time. I hated that I had to disappoint them. Some will fault me for having changed my position, and I can understand this, yet, as James Russell Lowell once said, ``The foolish and the dead alone never change their opinion.'' 
   In fact, one of the greatest events of all time was brought about by the changing of one man's opinion 2000 years ago. Before he became the Great Apostle, Paul, who was then called Saul, was a persecutor of Christians. But after Saul was converted--he changed his opinion, his viewpoint, and his life. The Apostle Paul had a compelling influence on the future course of history. In Paul's case, God spoke to him and lifted his literal and psychic blindness. I do not contend that my change of viewpoint is in any way on the same scale of Paul's, or that such momentous results will follow, of course, but his story does remind us that one can be blinded to the truth by misplaced passion. 
   Mr. President, I yield to no-one in my respect, honor, and reverence for Old Glory. Nor do I yield to anyone in my commitment to those veterans who, for the benefit of all Americans, have given so much in defense of our country and in defense of our flag. Yet, despite my love for the flag, and despite my commitment to our Nation's veterans, I regret that I cannot support this well-intended amendment. I cannot support it because I do not feel that it belongs in our Constitution; because I believe that many instances of flag desecration can be prosecuted under general laws protecting public or private property, laws which do not require any constitutional amendment; I cannot support the amendment because flag burning, though loathsome, is hardly pervasive enough to warrant amending the Constitution; I cannot support the amendment because I fear that the primary effect of this amendment would be more, not fewer, incidents of flag destruction; and because I feel that, rather than rushing into a constitutional amendment, we might be better served by allowing the Supreme Court the opportunity to revisit this issue. 
   What do I mean, Mr. President, when I say that this measure does not ``belong'' in the Constitution? Let me start by being clear about what I do not mean. I do not mean that protecting the flag is a trivial or unimportant goal of government. Nor do I mean that the flag deserves anything less than our complete reverence and our complete devotion. What I do mean, quite simply, is that a ban on flag desecration does not fit into--would, in fact, be out of place in--the skeletal document which lays out the basic organization and structure of the national government, determines federal-state relations, and protects the fundamental liberties of the people, all of us. 
   I think my meaning will be clearer if we take a closer look at the purposes that constitutional amendments are intended to serve. The Framers gave this matter some thought in their deliberations at Philadelphia in 1787. 
   They considered and they rejected resolve No. 13 of the Virginia Plan offered by Gov. Edmund Randolph of that State, resolve 13 which would have permitted ``amendment of the Articles of Union whensoever it shall seem necessary,'' and which stated ``that the assent of the National Legislature ought not to be required thereto.'' They rejected that. Indeed, several delegates to the Convention, among them Charles Pinkney of South Carolina, opposed any provision for Constitutional amendments to the Constitution. Recognizing, however, that occasional revisions might be necessary, the Convention finally agreed upon a compromise that deliberately made it difficult to amend the Constitution by requiring successive supermajorities. Article V sets up a cumbersome two-step process to amend the Constitution. It is cumbersome because the framers intended it to be cumbersome. The first step is approval either by two-thirds of Congress meaning both Houses or--and this has never been done--by a convention called for by two-thirds of the states. The second step is ratification by three-fourths of the states. 
   Given the hurdles set up by Article V, it should come as no surprise that so few amendments to the Constitution have been approved. There are twenty-seven in all, and the first ten were ratified en bloc in 1791--209 years ago. In the two hundred and nine years since ratification of the Bill of Rights, there have been just 17 additional amendments. Think of that. If we disregard the 18th and 21st Amendments, marking the beginning and end of Prohibition, we are left with only 15 amendments in 209 years! 
   The 18th amendment was wiped out after 15 years by the 21st amendment. These mark the beginning and end of Prohibition. 
   So, as I say, we are left with actually only 15 amendments in 209 years. Just think of it. In 209 years, despite all of the political, economic, and social changes this country has experienced over the course of more than two centuries; despite the advent of electricity, which lights this Chamber, and despite the advent of the internal combustion engine; despite one civil war and two world wars and several smaller wars; despite the discovery of modes of communication and transportation beyond the wildest fancies of the most visionary framers, this document, the Constitution of the United States, has been amended only 15 times. If you want to count the 21st amendment, 16 times would be the total number. 
   Truly, the Constitution is an extraordinary work of wisdom and foresight on the part of the framers. George Washington and James Madison may be forgiven for referring to the product of their labor as ``little short of a miracle.'' Gladstone may well have gotten  it right when in 1887 he declared the Constitution to be the most wonderful work ever struck off at a given time by the brain and purpose of man. 
   As for those 15 amendments I have just mentioned, these can generally be divided into two roughly equal categories. One category consists of those amendments that deal with the structure and organization of the three branches of Government, the laying out of the three separate branches--the legislative, the executive, the judiciary. The checks and balances, these include the 11th amendment. Of course, those were included in the original Constitution, the separation of powers, in the first, second, and third articles--the legislative, executive, and judicial. 
   As to the amendments, the 15 amendments plus the first 10, these include the 11th amendment, preventing the Federal courts from hearing suits against States by citizens of other States; the 12th amendment, regarding the election of the President and the Vice President; the 17th amendment, establishing the direct elections of Senators; the 20th amendment, regulating Presidential terms and related matters; the 22nd amendment, limiting a President to two terms; the 25th amendment, regarding Presidential succession; and the 27th amendment, deferring congressional pay raises until after an intervening election. 
   There is very little need for me to attempt to justify the inclusion of these provisions in the Constitution. However we may feel about them personally, their subject matter, the structure of the Federal Government, fits in perfectly with that of articles I through IV. 
   There is good reason to suspect the framers themselves thought that most, if not all, amendments would address structural matters. In No. 85 of the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton expressed it this way: A thorough conviction that any constitutional amendments which ``may, upon mature consideration, be thought useful, will be applicable to the organization of the government and not to the mass of its powers.'' 
   Hear that again: Hamilton expressed a thorough conviction that any constitutional amendments which ``may, upon mature consideration, be thought useful, will be applicable to the organization of the government, and not to the mass of its powers.'' 
   In Hamilton's mind, any amendments would deal with the structure, the organization, of the Government. 
   The second category consists of those constitutional amendments that narrow the powers of government and expand or protect fundamental personal rights. These include the 13th amendment banning slavery, the 14th amendment, which extended citizenship to all persons ``born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof'' and guaranteed all citizens certain basic protections, and the 15th, 19th, 23th, 24th, and 26th amendments, each of which extended the vote to new groups of citizens. 
   Clearly, the flag desecration amendment fits into neither category. For constitutional purposes, it is neither fish nor fowl. It does not address a structural concern; it does not deal with Federal relations between the National and State governments--in other words, the Federal system; it extends, rather than narrows, the powers of government; and it does not protect a basic civil right. 
   Look at your Constitution. Look at your Constitution and the amendments thereto which, to all intents and purposes, are part of the Constitution. You will see that the Constitution overall narrows the powers of government; it does not extend those powers. Indeed, some opponents of this amendment that is before us argue that it restricts personal liberty. 
   The 13th amendment forbidding slavery may be viewed as the only amendment regulating the conduct of individuals. The 13th amendment was the product of a bitter, fiercely contested Civil War, the War Between the States, and it was necessary to end one of the most loathsome and shameful institutions in our Nation's history. This, the 13th amendment, was an exceptional amendment. It was necessitated by exceptional circumstances. 
   There was, of course, one notable attempt to regulate individual conduct via a constitutional amendment. I have already referred to that, the 18th amendment, instituting Prohibition, which also deviated from the model of constitutional amendments I have laid out--with disastrous results. Like the flag desecration amendment, the 18th amendment sought to restrict private conduct in the name of a greater social good. Like the flag desecration amendment, the 18th amendment had a commendable goal. Nonetheless, the 18th amendment was a mistake and it took us 15 years to rectify it. True, the mistake was rectified in 1933, but the damage was already done. The 21st amendment ended Prohibition, but it could not erase the preceding 15 years in which a constitutional provision--not a statute, a constitutional provision, a portion of the highest law in the land--was routinely ignored and violated. You see, once that 18th amendment was riveted into the Constitution, it took 15 years to unlock it, to undo it, to repeal it. 
   Prohibition not only made criminals and scofflaws of countless Americans, it also placed them in violation of the Constitution. I can remember the revenue officers, when they came to the coal camps and when they scoured around the hills and the mountains looking for the moonshine stills. I can remember those revenuers. That was a terrible mistake, and, while the blemish to the Constitution has since faded, the lesson may not have been learned. 
   Thus, a constitutional amendment against flag burning may very well prove to be counterproductive, just as did the Prohibition amendment. If this were to happen, our Constitution 
   would be diminished and flag burning would continue--would continue. 
   In the final analysis, it is the Constitution--not the flag--that is the foundation and guarantor of the people's liberties. Respect for that Constitution should not be undermined by amendments, however well intentioned, that cannot be enforced. I fought the constitutional amendment to balance the budget for the same reason. I said it could not, would not--would not be enforced, and that as a result of lack of enforcement, the people's faith in the Constitution would be undermined. I say the same thing here. It will not be enforced. 
   It is like the Commandment that says: ``Thou shalt not kill,'' but killing goes on every day right here in the Nation's Capital. 
   ``Thou shalt not steal,'' but stealing continues. 
   I have come to believe strongly that constitutional amendments, as Madison said, should be saved ``for certain and extraordinary occasions.'' I am not saying the Constitution should never be amended. I am not saying that. Madison was not saying that either. But Madison said that constitutional amendments should be saved for ``certain and extraordinary occasions.'' 
   Critics may accuse me of being overly conservative, but I believe I am right. I have learned from study and from my own recent experience with the proposed constitutional amendment to balance the budget that tinkering with the careful system of checks and balances and the separation of powers contained in the Constitution, can have far-reaching and sometimes unexpected consequences. When it comes to revising the most basic text in our Federal system, when it comes to improving upon the handiwork of Washington and Madison and Hamilton and James Wilson and Roger Sherman and Gouverneur Morris and Benjamin Franklin and others at the convention; when it comes to setting a pen to the sacred charter of our liberties that my colleagues and I have sworn at the desk to uphold and defend--then, yes, I am conservative. 
   While I do not rule out the possibility that I might offer an amendment some day, as I have done in the past--I have learned a lot in these last years in the Senate--they should be reserved, as Madison said, for compelling circumstances when alternatives are unavailable. 
   Polls are no substitute for reasoned analysis and independent thought. Polls were very much in evidence during the balanced budget amendment debate, and we see the same thing here today. Who would oppose a balanced budget? Those of us who voted against the balanced budget amendment did not oppose a balanced budget. We were opposed to what that amendment would do to the Constitution of the United States; what it would do to the  faith and confidence of the American people in their Constitution. 
   Who would oppose protecting the flag? Nobody here certainly. But the Senate, in particular, was intended by the framers to be an oasis of cool, deliberate debate, free from the hasty and heated rhetoric that characterizes so many political exchanges. 
   The writers of the Constitution were remarkable men. Such a gathering probably never before sat down within the four corners of the Earth. That was the real miracle that took place in Philadelphia, that those minds, and many of them were young--Franklin was 81, but Pinckney was 29; Gouverneur Morris was 35; Madison was 36; Hamilton was 30--that so many brilliant minds sat down in one place at a given moment in time. The clock of time had struck. Had it been 5 years earlier, they would not have experienced to the full the flaws of the Articles of Confederation, so they would not have been ready. Had it been 5 years later, they would have seen all of the ills, the extremes of the French Revolution, the deaths at the guillotine. They would have been repelled in horror by what happened there, the excesses. These were the miracles: the right place, the right time, and the right men. 
   The framers of the Constitution were indeed remarkable men, and their words are often as wise and relevant today as they were two centuries ago. Thus, Madison wrote in Federalist 49 that ``a constitutional road to the decision of the people ought to be marked out and kept open, for certain great and extraordinary occasions.'' 
   Currently, there appears to be no such ``great and extraordinary'' occasion that calls for a 28th constitutional amendment. 
   Madison also warned against the reference of constitutional questions to the people too often. ``Do not do it too often,'' he said. ``Do not send amendments to the American people too often.'' 
   In the Federalist 49, he said:  
   ..... as every appeal to the people would carry an implication of some defect in the government, frequent appeals would, in great measure, deprive the government of that veneration which time bestows on everything, and without which perhaps the wisest and freest governments would not possess the requisite stability.  
   Madison further said:  
   The danger of disturbing the public tranquility by interesting too strongly the public passions is a still more serious objection against a frequent reference of constitutional questions to the decision of the whole society. ..... But the greatest objection of all is that the decisions which would probably result from such appeals would not answer the purpose of maintaining constitutional equilibrium of the government.  
   That was James Madison warning us against sending to the American people constitutional amendments too often. 
   Flag destruction is, fortunately, only a rare occurrence. While our culture may have become increasingly coarse and vulgar at times--and it certainly has, there is no question about that--most Americans respect the flag and most Americans voluntarily refrain from abusing it. 
   I do not want to give the same attention-seekers who defile the flag the opportunity to defy the Constitution as well. By one act, they would then be able to desecrate and defy the flag and at the same time to defy--defy, defy--the Constitution of the United States. This is more than a matter of symbolism; this is a question of respect for the founding document of this Republic and the supreme law of the land. 
   Any disrespect for the Constitution is a repudiation of the most basic principles and laws of the country. And now you say let's put into the Constitution some verbiage that cannot be enforced, that will not be enforced; cannot be. It will be defied by some. 
   Let me say that again. Any disrespect for the Constitution is a repudiation of the most basic principles and laws of the country. We are talking about the supreme law of the land. The law here can be changed--passed today and changed before the beginning of the next Congress next year. But not a constitutional amendment. Once it is welded into the Constitution, it will take years to repeal it, to take it out, to remove it, as we saw in the case of amendment No. 18, the prohibition amendment. 
   I shrink from the possibility of providing a tiny minority of rabble-rousers with the ammunition to fire upon the most important and beloved document in the country. 
   As I suggested a bit earlier, we already made the mistake once before of inserting into the Constitution a restriction on private conduct that could not be enforced. The Constitution suffered terribly under Prohibition. It would also have suffered under a balanced budget amendment, another unenforceable and litigation-inducing provision that many of my colleagues wished to insert into the Constitution. Just as I opposed the balanced budget amendment out of a desire to protect the Constitution from further abasements, so, too, I must oppose a flag desecration amendment. It, too, would be unenforceable. 
   If one provision of the Constitution proves to be unenforceable, what about the other provisions? 
   Just as I am resolved to protect both the Constitution and the flag, I am determined that we not make martyrs of those villains who would sully--who would sully--the Stars and Stripes. Why should we let these malefactors portray themselves as courageous iconoclasts, sacrificed at the altar of public complacency and intolerance? It is possible, I believe, to craft statutory protection for the flag that can withstand a court challenge. The amendment in the form of a substitute that was offered by Senator MCCONNELL, the Flag Protection Act of 1999, could, in the opinion of the American Law Division of the Library of Congress, withstand such scrutiny. In the words of that opinion, ``subsections (b) and (c) appear to present no constitutional difficulties, based on judicial precedents, either facially or as applied.'' Further, the opinion notes, ``Almost as evident from the Supreme Court's precedents, subsection (a) is quite likely to pass constitutional muster.'' The opinion closes by noting, ``In conclusion, the judicial precedents establish that the bill, if enacted, while not reversing Johnson and Eichman, should survive constitutional attack on First Amendment grounds.'' 
   The first case to which I just referred, of Texas v. Johnson, arose from an incident during the 1984 Republican Convention in Dallas, Texas, in which Gregory Lee Johnson participated in a political demonstration and burned an American flag while protestors chanted. Johnson was convicted of desecration of a venerated object in violation of a Texas statute, and a State Court of Appeals affirmed the decision. However, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reversed the decision, holding that burning the flag was expressive conduct for which the State could not, under the First Amendment, punish Johnson in these circumstances. The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, upheld the lower court's decision. 
   But in the dissent by Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice White, and Justice O'Connor, they noted, ``the Texas statute deprived Johnson of only one rather inarticulate symbolic form of protest--a form of protest that was profoundly offensive to many--and left him with a full panoply of other symbols and every conceivable form of verbal expression to express his deep disapproval of national policy.'' The Justices also observed, ``Surely one of the high purposes of a democratic society is to legislate against conduct that is regarded as evil and profoundly offensive to the majority of people--whether it be murder, embezzlement, pollution, or flag burning.'' 
   After the Johnson decision, Congress passed the Flag Protection Act of 1989, criminalizing the conduct of anyone who ``knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon'' a United States flag, except conduct related to the disposal of a ``worn or soiled'' flag. Subsequently, several people, among them Shawn D. Eichman, were prosecuted in District Courts. In each case, the appellees moved to dismiss the charges on the ground that the Act violated the First Amendment. The District Courts, following the precedent set by the Johnson case, held the Act unconstitutional as applied and dismissed the charges. The Supreme Court, again in a 5-4 decision, upheld the decision. 
   However, in the dissent authored by Justice Stevens, with whom the Chief Justice, Justice White, and Justice O'Connor joined, the justices noted  that ``it is equally well settled that certain methods of expression may be prohibited if (a) the prohibition is supported by a legitimate societal interest that is unrelated to the suppression of ideas the speaker desires to express; (b) the prohibition does not entail any interference with the speaker's freedom to express those ideas by other means; and (c) the interest in allowing the speaker complete freedom of choice among alternative methods of expression is less important than the societal interest supporting the prohibition.'' 
   Given the closeness of the votes in Johnson and Eichman--given the presumption against amending the Constitution whenever other alternatives are available--and given the 
   powerful arguments made by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Stevens in their dissents--perhaps the better course of action is to allow the Court sufficient time to reconsider its views on this controversial topic. 
   The Court has already changed its composition since the Eichman decision eight years ago. Four of the Justices who decided that case, including three who voted with the majority, have been replaced. Who can say whether a new court will find itself swayed by the persuasive arguments that Mssrs. Rehnquist and Stevens have put forth? Instead of our adding a new, 28th Amendment to the Constitution, would it not be preferable for the Court, on closer inspection of the issue, to realize the error of its ways? 
   Like many Americans, I was shocked by the Johnson and Eichman decisions overturning statutory protection for the flag. Now, that shock has subsided, and while I still question the correctness of those decisions, I no longer believe that a constitutional amendment is the best response to these horrific acts. The intervening years have allowed me to rethink my initial reaction to the Supreme Court's decisions, and while my love for the flag has not waned, neither have my respect for and devotion to the Constitution. If anything, the spate of proposed constitutional amendments in recent years--chief among them the misguided balanced budget amendment--and my continued studies of constitutional history have only increased my love for this magnificent document and my determination to prevent its abuse. 
   Every time I read it--as with every time I read the Bible--I find something, it seems, that is new and intriguing and awe-inspiring. 
   I have always promised my constituents that I will represent them to the best of my ability and with an open mind and an honest heart. Today, head and heart have convinced me to reconsider my beliefs. As Benjamin Franklin, the oldest man at the Constitutional Convention, put it, in addressing his fellow conferees at Philadelphia as they prepared to sign the Constitution--this is what he said--``For having lived long, I have experienced many instances of being obliged by better information or fuller consideration, to change opinions even on important subjects, which I once thought right, but found to be otherwise.'' 
   That has happened to me on several occasions. Certainly, it is true in the present instance. 
   While I salute the patriotism of those who support this measure--I salute them--I hope that they will pause to consider its unintended but inevitable ramifications. Rather than inviting a surge in flag destruction; rather than spurring years of legal wrangling; rather than adding to our Constitution a provision that addresses a problem that occurs only infrequently, let us step back. 
   Let us reconsider the matter. Let us rethink what we are proposing. 
   Our Founding Fathers intended that amending the Constitution should be a difficult and laborious process--time consuming; cumbersome--not to be undertaken lightly. It sets a dangerous precedent, one that I have come to appreciate fully in recent years, to tinker with the careful checks and balances established by the Constitution. When it comes to our founding charter, history demands our utmost prudence. 
   Every heart in this Chamber thrills at the sight of that flag, thrills at the rays of sunlight that play upon those stars and stripes, as we ride down or walk down a street on the Fourth of July. The flag! There is no other flag like it! None. 
   But what gives each of us freedom of speech? What gives each of us the right to say what we want to say? What gives us that right? Not that flag--but the Constitution of the United States! 
   What gives the fourth estate that sits in those galleries up there--the press--what gives the press freedom to print, to televise, to broadcast? What gives this country freedom of the press? Not Old Glory, not that flag--but the Constitution of the United States! 
   What gives my coal miners from West Virginia the right to come to these Capitol steps and to speak out and to thunder their criticism of the President of the United States or of the Congress of the United States, while Old Glory floats above the dome in the blue sky? What gives those miners that right? Not the flag, not Old Glory, soaring in the heavens--but the Constitution of the United States! 
   What gives the truckers, what gives the farmers, what gives any group the right to come to Capitol Hill and to assemble and to petition the Government to obtain a redress of grievances? Not the flag--but the Constitution of the United States! 
   There is the source of the right--there is the source--not in the dear old flag. The flag is the symbol of the Republic, the symbol of what the Constitution provides, but it is not the flag that provides it. It is the Constitution of the United States. That is why today I speak out against the amendment before the Senate, because it is that Constitution that provides us with the rights which all Americans enjoy, regardless of race, regardless of color, regardless of national origin, regardless of age or sex. It isn't that flag. 
   I love it. How many times do we go the last mile of the way with a friend or a relative who sleeps beneath the closed lid of a steel coffin draped with the American flag? It is something to remember. He may have been a soldier, a sailor, a marine. He didn't die for that flag. He died for what that flag represents. And the instrument that provides what that flag represents is the Constitution of the United States. 
   It is the real stuff! 
   I think I am right to have changed my mind. I want to say again that I changed my mind because of long and serious study, not only of the Constitution of the United States, but also of the Articles of Confederation which was the first Constitution of the U.S., my study of the Federalist Papers, my study of the history of our country, the history of the colonies, the history of England, the struggles of Englishmen, and my studies of the ancient Romans. Because of these studies, in the beginning with the respect to the constitutional amendment to balance the budget and then with respect to the line-item veto, which I hate with a passion, and which the Supreme Court of the U.S. overthrew, I came to know more about the Constitution, about American constitutionalism, about the history of the Constitution, about the ratifying conventions, than I ever knew before. And it is the result of that long and assiduous study of constitutionalism in America, constitutionalism that had its roots not just at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, but in the states before the Constitution, and in the colonies before the states, and in the Biblical covenants before the colonies; roots that go back 1,000-2,000 years. I have come to this conclusion, and I believe that I can best serve my country today by voting against this amendment. 
   The flag lives because the Constitution lives, without which there would be no American Republic, without which there would be no American Senate, without which there would be no United States of America, only the balkanized States of America. Without that Constitution, there would be no American liberty, no American flag. 
   That flag is the symbol of our Nation. In a way, we might say that that flag is the symbol of all we hold near and dear. That flag is the symbol of our Nation's history. That flag is the symbol of our Nation's values. We love that flag. But we must love the Constitution more. For the Constitution is not just a symbol, it is the thing itself! 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Vermont and the senior Senator from North Dakota for their remarks. I also thank them for the courage they have displayed time and time again in protecting this founding document. I thank them for the inspiring leadership that the rest of us have had from watching 
   them and listening to them. They, indeed, have done a tremendous service to the country, to the Senate, and to the Constitution. I thank them both from the bottom of my heart.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to acknowledge my good friend Senator TED STEVENS' special honor as Alaska's Man of the Century, which I understand will be awarded to him this Saturday in Anchorage. 
   Speaking as a Senator from the State of West Virginia, it is a fitting tribute, I believe, for a man whose life has been devoted to Alaska since long before Alaska became a State. 
   Calvin Coolidge once said:  
   No person was ever honored for what he received. Honor has been the reward for what he gave.  
   Calvin Coolidge was a man of few words. 
   The Bible says:  
   A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.  
   Calvin Coolidge spoke words that were fitly stated. Senator TED STEVENS has given much to Alaska, and he has given much to the Nation. He has given much to the Senate. He served his nation in war as a pilot in the 14th Air Force in World War II. As chairman of the Defense Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations, which he also leads with great distinction, and as a cofounder of the Senate Arms Control Observer Group, Senator STEVENS has continued to look after U.S. national security interests and the men and women who serve, as he did, in the uniform of her armed forces. 
   Senator TED STEVENS has served his nation well in war, and he has served his nation well in peace, upholding the laws of the land as an attorney, as a U.S. attorney, and as a solicitor for the Department of the Interior. He has served in the executive branch of Government working as an assistant to the then Secretary of the Department of the Interior, Mr. Seaton, to create and pass legislation making Alaska the Nation's 49th State. 
   I am proud to have voted to support the entry of both Alaska and Hawaii into the National Union. I am the only person on Capitol Hill who voted for statehood for both Alaska and Hawaii. I believe that is right. I was in the House when I voted for statehood for Alaska. 
   Senator STEVENS has been a leader in the legislative branch as a Senator from Alaska, looking out first, last, and always for the unique interests of his unique State, as well as for the interests of the Nation while serving as the assistant Senate Republican leader, serving as the Republican whip, and serving as chairman of the Appropriations Committee. His legislative accomplishments in behalf of Alaska are many--many--and they reflect the challenges of living, working, and traveling in a State that possesses half of the coastline of the United States, some of the most varied and spectacular terrain in the Nation, ranging from giant glaciers to volcanoes, and some of the most punishing weather, as well as some of the most delightful weather, on the planet. 
   The old adage says that cream rises to the top, and it is safe to say then that Senator STEVENS is the cream of the cream, the very best, for he has risen to the top of every profession, every endeavor, every challenge that he has ever tackled. His fellow Alaskans will add the cherry on top of the cream of the cream by recognizing his multitudinous accomplishments, his supreme dedication, and his deep passion for service when they bestow upon Senator STEVENS the very distinct honor of naming a very special man, Senator STEVENS, Alaska's Man of the Century. 
   Now the century is not over yet. I hope the people of Alaska understand that. Our own people need to understand that as well. The century is not over yet, nor is the second millennium. It is still going on. The new millennium will begin next year, not this year, and the new century will begin next year, not this year. But this is the man, the Man of the Century for Alaska. 
   Although he was not born in the earliest years of this century, his legacy for Alaska is more than enough to span the century and to reach into the next century as well. 
   Senator STEVENS is a worthy representative of his great State. He is the kind of Senator whom the framers of the Constitution had in mind when, on July 16, 1787, they reached the Great Compromise out of which came this, the greatest Senate of the world in all of the history of man. 
   His sometimes fiery temper matches the fiery volcanoes that rim the Aleutians, while his dogged persistence mirrors the inexorable push of the icy glaciers of the frozen North. His understanding of the appropriations process is as thorough as an Alaskan snowfall, blanketing every nook, every cranny, every corner of the budget. But his warm and courteous consideration of his colleagues and his staff reflects the loyalty and the teamwork necessary to survive in the cold wastes of faraway Alaska. 
   I know him to be a worthy competitor. I know him to be a loyal friend, a man of his word. What more can a man say? And only the Man of the Century could be like this man. He is an honest speaker of even the hardest and difficult truths, a man of surprising compassion and unexpected mirth. I am proud to see him honored. I wish I could be in Alaska when he is honored. I would like to just have a few minutes in Alaska to speak about this man to his own people. They know him best. The Bible says:  
   A prophet is not without honour save in his own country, and house.  
   But you see how this man's own house, how his own country, how his own State, how his own constituents, how his own people who know him best, how they honor him. I am proud to see him honored. I hope he enjoys the good wishes and the attention that will be his on Saturday. 
   Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once said this:  
   Through our great good fortune, in our youth our hearts were touched with fire. It was given us to learn at the outset that life is a profound and passionate thing. While we were permitted to scorn nothing but indifference, and do not pretend to undervalue the worldly rewards of ambition, we have seen with our own eyes, beyond and above the gold fields, the snowy heights of honor, and it is for us to bear the report to those who come after us.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am aware that some Senators have come to this floor in recent weeks to talk about rapidly increasing petroleum prices, and other Senators have raised serious concerns about home heating oil prices in the Northeast this winter. I also recall that certain regions of this country were threatened by electricity brownouts last summer, to say nothing of the difficulties our beleaguered farmers may face this year and to say nothing at this moment of what they faced last year. All of these issues raise serious concerns that affect our everyday lives in every season and region of the country. The crisis that we have all been witnessing not only forces us to question our dependence on foreign oil, but, more importantly, to confront the crying need for a serious domestic energy strategy. 
   I remember very well, because I was here, the energy problems this country experienced in the 1970's. During that decade, we were forced to confront our energy demands and our vulnerability to the whims of foreign powers. A quarter century later, this nation is still facing that same vulnerability. While some circumstances may have changed, the United States is now importing more than half of its oil from overseas. This fact, in addition to the potential for volatile market swings, is very unsettling to me. The United States should not be held hostage to the capricious decisions of other nations--friend or foe. We should not have to go, hat in hand, to other nations to beg them to produce more oil so that our supply and prices in the United States do not plummet to levels that stifle the economy. We should not have to think of sending in the troops every time some regional difficulty arises in the Middle East. 
   Our ultimate national interest lies with concerns that are much larger than the current price hikes in gasoline, diesel, home heating oil, or electricity. Though I am certain that, in time, this petroleum crisis will pass as most crises do, I fear that, as a nation, we will sink back into somnolence, asleep at the wheel so to speak. The alarm is ringing loudly today, and it is time to wake up and address the underlying issue--our lack of a serious, comprehensive national energy strategy. That is the underlying issue. Our policies must take into account our energy independence and U.S. energy security. We need a policy that buffers our economy and our people from decisions made by foreign suppliers. It is past time to focus on increased research and development into advanced technologies, energy efficiency and conservation measures, and market incentives for these advanced technologies and conservation measures. Obviously we must also be sensitive to the environment. Clean air and clean water matter; the responsible use of our land matters; and the potential impact caused by the growth of greenhouse gases matters. We should aggressively investigate promising carbon sequestration technologies. In fact, a comprehensive national energy strategy must also incorporate a strong environmental strategy. I believe that we can, and that we should undertake this challenge. We ought to do it now. 
   The United States is vast, and our resources are vast. We are a fortunate nation in that regard. The Creator has blessed us. Our economy is booming and with that boom comes an increased appetite for energy. We must consider how much we consume and how efficiently we use these resources. We possess energy reserves of oil and natural gas, as well as wind, solar, hydro, 
   fuel cell, geothermal, and nuclear power. And, some of our most abundant energy sources are the coal reserves underlying many areas of the United States. We will need all of these resources if we are ever to achieve the goal of stable energy independence. It is time to examine the tough questions and to explore the opportunities before us to increase our energy independence. 
   This is a daunting task, and its success is dependent on our active support of a focused research and development program. I serve as the Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. I am proud to have been able to provide funding for a range of critical research and development programs for energy efficiency. 
   I have been on that committee 41 years; now going on 42 years. I have been on that Appropriations Committee longer than any other Senator has ever served on it. During that time, I have been conscious of the need for more energy research and the need for a comprehensive energy strategy. So I have provided funding for a range of critical research and development programs for energy efficiency. 
   One such research and development effort that I am especially proud of is the Clean Coal Technology Program. I believe that it was, and continues to be, a commonsense, forward thinking program. 
   In 1985, I was able to provide the initial $750 million to create the Department of Energy's Clean Coal Technology Program. It has been a very successful public-private partnership. Originally designed to address acid rain reduction, the Clean Coal Technology Program is now addressing a broader range of emission issues, including the reduction of greenhouse gases. 
   Over the years, more than $2.4 billion in federal funding has moved the clean coal program forward. I have supported every dollar that has been utilized in this way. To date, 40 projects have been approved, with 32 either completed or scheduled to be completed by the end of 2001. But there is a disturbing trend taking shape at the Federal level. These funds are being threatened by deferrals and rescissions by this Administration. 
   I have had to try to fight off these deferrals and rescissions that are being recommended by this administration. A critical research and development program that supports more efficient use of one of our most abundant domestic fuel sources--coal--must not be eviscerated if we are serious about advancing our energy security goal. We must continue to be ready in the event of a crisis. We have seen these crises occur before. Yet here we are with an administration that wants to rescind, wants to defer, moneys that are to be spent in the clean coal technology program. 
   The utter folly of such an approach is self-evident. Here we have been caught without a cushion, so we were not prepared for the crisis the country is now in. We should have been prepared. Coal cannot be taken off the list of domestic energy sources if we are ever to get out of the posture of begging, begging, begging OPEC for mercy. 
   I come from a coal State. Coal reserves are plentiful--not so plentiful as they once were in my State, but they are plentiful in this country. Coal supplies 56 percent of all electricity in this country. See the lights up here. Electricity is what makes those lights burn. What is behind that electricity? Coal, C-O-A-L. It keeps the lights burning in the hospitals, in the schools, in the Federal buildings, in the White House. 
   Coal, as I say, supplies 56 percent of all electricity in this country--56 percent. 
   Coal has literally fueled the American economy. It will continue to be an important source of energy for the foreseeable future--and it must continue to be. I know that there are concerns about coal mining and coal use.  Some past practices would, quite rightly, not be condoned today. But we are capable, as a nation, of doing better, and we are doing more by improving these practices while also supplying the electricity that operates the wheels of industry and that lightens the offices so we can do our work, supplying an important fuel that lights our homes and businesses. 
   For years, not just recently, I have promoted clean coal and other clean energy technologies through research and development. But many of these newer, cleaner technologies are more costly to bring to the market. We also need to address the gap between the research and development of these promising technologies and their widespread deployment in the marketplace. It is imperative that we fill that gap. 
   For this reason, I have worked with Minority Leader DASCHLE and other Members of this body to develop a targeted package of tax incentives to encourage the demonstration and deployment of many energy efficient technologies. I worked with these Members for over a year and a half to craft S. 1833, the Energy Security Tax Act of 1999. If Senators have concerns about developing greater energy independence and encouraging cleaner, more efficient technologies, then I urge them to take a serious look at this legislation. Clean coal technologies are included in this package, as are a broad range of incentives for other fuels, including coal mine methane, renewables, and oil and gas. Additionally, we have included incentives for energy conservation technologies and energy efficient technologies and practices in the transportation, steel, and agriculture sectors. I say to my colleagues, if you want to help develop a strategy for an energy-independent country, then work to get this bill passed. It is the right thing for our economy, for the environment, for trade, and for jobs. It is a step toward a comprehensive national policy to promote energy efficiency, energy security, and energy independence. 
   If we want to have a national energy strategy, we must sit down together and bring all of our interests and concerns to the table. We must take a multi-pronged approach that looks at the whole range of fuels, the whole kit and caboodle, at more efficient energy technologies and conservation practices, and at the participation of a broad spectrum of industries and interested parties. I do not want the United States to be at the mercy of rogue nations. I do not want our economy to tremble each time OPEC flexes its muscle. I want to ensure that we remain economically competitive. An efficient, stable supply of energy is key. I believe that the challenges of this new century can be met, lighting the way for a new energy strategy that recognizes the importance of economic development and environmental protection at the same time. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today, as we observe the arrival of the vernal equinox and, with it, the official arrival of spring, the words of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge come easily to mind: 
 All Nature seems at work. Slugs leave their lair-- The bees are stirring--birds are on the wing-- And Winter slumbering in the open air, Wears on his smiling face a dream of Spring!  
   Washington has turned her smiling face towards spring as well. The roadsides, so recently painted gray-brown with grit and dirt in the wake of receding glaciers of snow mounded up by mastodon plow trucks, have greened again. The brave crocuses have forced their way through the still-cold Earth to offer their first bright promise of warmer weather, the merry forsythia mirrors the Sun's golden light, and the pear and magnolia trees are softening the gray weave of bare branches with their pink and white petals. Washington's famous cherry blossoms will soon be adding their dainty petals to the spring breezes. 
   It is time for the soft whisper of falling snow to be replaced by the conversational patter of spring rains. It is time for the volume to be turned up from the quiet solos of solitary winter birds to the rousing, full-throated chorus of springtime birdsongs. 
 I asked the robin, as he sprang From branch to branch and sweetly sang, What made his breast so round and red; Twas ``looking at the sun,'' he said; 
 I asked the violets, sweet and blue, Sparkling in the morning dew, Whence came their colors, then so shy; They answered, ``looking to the sky''; 
 I saw the roses, one by one, Unfold their petals to the sun, I asked them what made their tints so bright, And they answered, ``looking to the light''; 
 I asked the thrush, whose silvery note Came like a song from angel's throat, Why he sang in the twilight dim; He answered, ``looking up at Him.''  
   We have this full-throated chorus of springtime voices--the violets, the roses, the robin, the thrush, the other bird songs--and it is time to spade up the garden, releasing the intoxicating perfume of rich, moist earth. How my little dog, Billy, loves that scent. He stands watch over the spade as I prepare the ground for my tomatoes, and his ears are pricked up, his tail is wagging, his eyes are shining with anticipation, waiting to chip in with paws flying, heedless of the dirt he will track into the house on his white coat. You see, he is a Maltese. This is Billy Byrd--Billy Byrd II. I used to have another dog. It was a cocker spaniel, but it was Billy Byrd I. 
   It is also time to marvel at the mysteries of God's designs as we watch daffodils burn their way through dense layers of last year's leathery leaves in order to put on their bright show. It is time to wonder how a tiny crocus bulb, no larger than a thumbnail and no heavier than a dust-dry clod of earth, can push aside frozen Earth, melt its way through snow or ice, just to put out four colorful petals. I sometimes wonder for whom the crocuses' show is, for surely crocuses bloom too early for even the hardiest bee. 
   William Shakespeare observed that, ``There is no ancient gentlemen but gardeners ..... They hold up Adam's profession.'' There is indeed a kinship among gardeners, whether serious gardeners whose gardens are their lifelong avocation, or the duffer with a few beds who buys plants at the local hardware store each spring. All gardeners are, at heart, optimists. They have to be. This season allows the gardener each year to fall in love all over again, and to wear on his smiling face a dream of spring and of greatness in the garden. He stands outside, shovel in not-yet-blistered hand, and has visions. He sees, not the patchy lawn and unkempt flowerbeds worn by winter, but some grand turf flowing like a green sea between islands of color, Sun, and shade.  He foresees the abundance of the garden overflowing from his table to those of his friends and family. In March, it is not possible to truly believe that there will ever be too many tomatoes, too many zucchini, too many cucumbers. Each seed in the brightly colored envelope, each small budding plant, is precious and deserving of an opportunity to grow. Each is a gamble, but a gamble in which the gardener believes the odds are on his side. And why not? God is also on his side. Not all the plants will make it, but enough will, and those survivors will often exceed his most fecund imaginings. 
   West Virginia is full of master gardeners. Their pantries and cellars are treasure houses filled with jewel-tone quart jars of ruby tomatoes, emerald green beans, and sapphire blueberries. Crystal quilted jelly jars hold not precious unguents, but the ambrosia of the gods--homemade jams, jellies, and preserves distilled from the freshest strawberries, plums, cherries, quinces, apples, and blackberries. West Virginia's home canners are well prepared to cope with the bounteous overflow of the overambitious gardener. 
   To be a gardener is not only to be optimistic, but also to be patient. If something does not work out this year, there is always a different scheme next year. Over time, even the most scraggly sapling will reach majestic maturity, towering over the landscape and altering the microclimate of the yard with its shade and its earthmoving roots. The sun-loving flowers near it will gradually be replaced by those which tolerate increasing amounts of shade. No garden is a static place--how could it be?--filled with so much polite but fierce competition among its denizens, and always under attack by invading insects and dreaded diseases--black spot, to be sure, rather than the Black Plague, but dreaded, nonetheless. 
   To be a gardener is to be close to the Creator, to follow in His example. You see, God made the country; man made the town. To be, as Shakespeare said, holding up Adam's profession, that is what it is to be a gardener. We each try to create, at least in our dreams, our own small Eden. We learn the great lessons of life as we cultivate patience and nurture our optimism. In a garden one sees, up close--up close, up real close--the great mysteries of birth, life, struggle, death, yes, and renewal, writ small enough to comprehend and only then, to translate into some larger understanding that may, with age, approach wisdom. My chaplain will say, in a garden, God speaks to us simply, in the language of flowers. 
 The kiss of the sun for pardon, The song of the birds for mirth, One is nearer God's Heart in the garden Than anywhere else on earth.  
   So said Dorothy Frances Gurney, and surely her words are even more true in the spring garden than at any other time of year. It gives me joy to watch the greening of the earth, once again, and to witness the triumph of each little bulb and each little bud as it bursts forth, victorious over the chill of winter. I am filled with warmth that is easy to share, as I and my colleagues in Adam's profession emerge from our winter hibernation into the soft spring air and, with smiling faces, dream of spring. 
 The year's at the spring And day's at the morn; Morning's at seven; The hillside's dew-pearled; The lark's on the wing; The snail's on the thorn; God's in His Heaven-- All is right with the world.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, let us go back 2,000 years to the small family farms on the Italian peninsula. Those small family farms produced the rugged soldiers who helped ancient Rome to conquer all of the countries around the Mediterranean basin. Those family farms produced men and women who believed in the gods. They were pagan gods, but those ancient Romans believed in those gods, venerated their forefathers, their ancestors, taught their children to respect authority, to respect law, to respect the state. And the ancient Romans felt that the gods had in mind a particular destiny for their country. Each Roman felt that it was his duty to help to promote that destiny of his state. And then came the latifundia, the great corporate farms. Senators bought up land. They became huge farms. The farmers, the peasants, left the land 
   and migrated into the cities and became a part of the mob that sought the theater and free bread. 
   And when that happened, remember that the Roman legions, which constituted the greatest military fighting machine of that time, were able to get their recruits from the farms. When the peasants left the land, left the home, and the home deteriorated and the belief in the gods dimmed and faded, the great Roman Senate weakened, lost its way, lost its nerve, and without being forced to ceded to the dictators--the Caesars, and later the Emperors--the power of the purse, that was the beginning of the end. Rome collapsed. 
   The same thing has happened here in America. When we look at our colonial forebears, they had the stamina, the stern discipline of the ancient Romans. They believed in a creator, and the home was where the values were inculcated into the young people. They respected the law, they respected authority, they respected their fathers and mothers, and they took seriously the Biblical injunction ``honor thy father and thy mother.'' 
   We can take a lesson from the ancient Romans and many a leaf out of their history because there were several parallels between those ancient Romans and our colonial ancestors and the America that was--not the America that is, but the America that was--up until 50 years ago, or some such. 
   I am in the very mood at this moment to commend my distinguished colleague, the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. DORGAN, when he talks about these farmers. They are the people who toil the earth. They have to depend upon the weather; it is uncertain. They can't count on, from month to month or year to year, what the weather is going to be, how dependable it is going to be. What a life they have to live. It is a rugged life, but it is a clean life--clean in that they understand what it is to be near the soil and near God's great tradition. I wish that more of our young people grew up on the farm. There was a time in this country when 90 percent of the population was from the farms. That day is long gone. 
   I thank the Senator, who so often enlightens this great body on issues of importance to the country. He has his head screwed on right. His heart is where it ought to be. He has sound wisdom. He has done a great service today speaking about the small farmers. I personally thank him for what he means to the Senate and to the people of his State.

   Mr. BYRD. Before the distinguished Senator goes to lunch, would he agree with me that Oliver Goldsmith, writing in ``The Deserted Village,'' must have had our family farmers in mind when he said: 
 Ill fares the land, to hastening ills of prey, Where wealth accumulates, and men decay; Princes and Lords may flourish or may fade; A breath can make them, as a breath has made; But a bold peasantry, their country's pride, When once destroy'd, can never be supplied.  
   Is there anything more fitting by way of poetry than Oliver Goldsmith's words in ``The Deserted Village'' when he talked about the bold peasantry?

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today marks the 11-month anniversary of the tragic school shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado. On April 20, 1999, 2 boys walked into their high school, armed to the hilt, and killed 13 students and faculty members before taking their own lives. Despite the horrible nature of this crime, and those that have followed it in Georgia, in Michigan, in the District of Columbia, and in other places throughout the country, the Congress has shown precious little leadership in exploring ways to help prevent mayhem in our schools. 
   Last May, in response to the Columbine shooting, this Senate passed the Juvenile Justice bill by an overwhelming bipartisan majority of 73-25. Despite this strong show of bipartisan agreement, the legislation is bogged down in a morass of election year politics. Despite the fact that the American people are crying out for some leadership on this issue, the Congress is proving itself to be uncaring, if not irrelevant. 
   There is plenty of controversy to go around anytime any measure comes before the Congress which deals with gun violence. We have all heard repeatedly the cautionary slogan chanted by some, ``guns don't kill people, people kill people.'' But increasingly in recent years it has been children who are wielding guns against their classmates. Perhaps the slogan should be changed to ``guns don't kill children, children kill children.'' Sadly, that slogan now has the ring of reality, but, I doubt that anyone will be lobbying for gun rights with those words imprinted on their lecture. 
   The Senate-passed legislation contained a number of important provisions to not only crack down on violent juvenile offenders, but also to reduce the potential for weapons to fall into the hands of children who may not understand all of the dangers that the weapons pose. 
   The Senate legislation is a compromise between the rights of the individual to keep and bear arms and the safety of the public to be protected from those who should not have those guns. The bill would require that every handgun sold must have a trigger safety lock or secure container. It would require background checks on all buyers at gun shows. The legislation would ban the youth possession of semiautomatic assault weapons and their high-capacity ammunition clips. And it would bar anyone convicted of a violent felony as a juvenile from possessing a gun. These are commonsense provisions on which I hope parents and gun owners alike could agree. 
   Last week, the Nation's leading gun manufacturer, Smith & Wesson, imposed upon itself many of the provisions contained in the Senate version of the Juvenile Justice bill, including trigger locks and background checks. If Smith & Wesson can see the wisdom of balancing public safety with private ownership rights, why can this Congress not do the same? 
   The last time--and, in fact, the only time--that the conference committee on the Juvenile Justice legislation met was last August. Time is of the essence. I urge the conferees on both sides of the hill to meet and to settle their differences. The longer they wait, the longer the delay, the better the chances are that some further tragedy will come along and steal the lives of more innocent children. We might make a difference. We might save a life. Why not have the courage to try? 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, is it any wonder why the approval ratings of the Congress go up every time we go into  recess? The American people are watching us, and they are wondering if we are really paying attention to the issues important to them. I fear that we are not paying enough attention, certainly. 
   Next month, the nation will observe the 1-year anniversary of the tragic shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado, in which fifteen people, including the two student gunmen, were killed. But this tragedy is not unique. 
   In May 1992, a 20-year-old killed four people and wounded ten others in an armed siege at his former high school in California. 
   In January 1993, a 17-year-old walked into his teacher's seventh-period English class in Kentucky, and shot her in the head. He then shot the janitor in the abdomen. 
   In February 1996, a 14-year-old student took an assault rifle to his school in Washington state and opened fire on his algebra class, killing two classmates and a teacher. 
   One year later, in February 1997, a 16-year-old student opened fire with a shotgun at a school in Alaska, killing a classmate and the school principal and wounding two other students. 
   In October 1997, a 16-year-old student, after shooting his mother, went to school with a gun and shot nine students, killing two of them. 
   In December 1997, a student opened fire on a student prayer circle at a Kentucky school, killing three students and wounding five others. 
   In March 1998, a pair of boys took rifles to school and turned them on classmates and teachers when they exited the building in response to a false fire alarm at their Arkansas school. Four girls and a teacher were killed, and 11 people were wounded. 
   In April 1998, at a Pennsylvania school, a 14-year-old-boy fatally shot a teacher and wounded two students at an eighth-grade dance. 
   The following month, in May 1998, a high school senior shot and killed another student in the school parking lot in Tennessee, and then turned the gun on himself. 
   Two days later, a freshman student in Oregon opened fire with a semi-automatic rifle in a high school cafeteria, killing two students and wounding 22 others. The teen's parents were later found shot to death in their home. This freshman student did not heed the admonition of the Scriptures which says: Honor thy father and thy mother. He prceeded to kill his father and his mother. 
   Then, a month after last year's massacre at Columbine High School, in May 1999, a 15-year-old gunman--I suppose you could call a 15-year-old a gunman--opened fire on fellow students in Georgia, injuring six students, including one critically. 
   Most recently, last week in Flint, Michigan, a six-year-old boy took a gun to school and killed a six-year-old girl in front of their shocked classmates. Six-year-olds killing six-year-olds--what have we come to? And yet, the Congress fails to act. Are we blind? Are we numb to these killings? Even in the city in which we work, the tragedies are mounting. In the District of Columbia, since the school year began in September, 18 juveniles have been killed. Of those, police say that half of them started as arguments at school and ended in death in nearby neighborhood streets. 
   Isn't this enough? Can't this Congress hear the cry of the American students, and their parents, to step up to the plate and at least debate ways to help break this cycle of violence? I know that Congress cannot solve this problem on its own, just as an individual school board or PTA cannot resolve this crisis acting as a single institution. But we, the elected leaders of this nation who are very quick to point to problems in other nations, are not even talking about ways to end this horrific record of children killing children. 
   Day after day, we criticize one nation for human rights violations or another nation for failing to meet the needs of its people. But who are we to look across the waters and criticize others if we remain silent, if we remain numb, if we remain mute, dumb about our own problems? 
   I am told that the current gridlock on this issue is because of partisanship. I hear that the reason the conference committee on the juvenile justice bill has only met once--last August--is that Members are at opposite ends of the spectrum on the gun-related provisions in the legislation. 
   This legislation does not take any dramatic steps toward weapons. It simply would put in place some commonsense provisions to balance public safety and private gun owners' rights. Requiring trigger locks would not jeopardize anyone's second amendment rights, but it might prevent children from using the guns at school--where the parents are at fault for letting those weapons lie around where they are within the reach, within the sight, of children. And improving background checks is not a monumental change either. These checks would only serve to prevent those people who should not have access to weapons from getting them. I hope responsible parents and gun owners will be able to support these commonsense provisions. 
   So I do not understand why this has to be a partisan issue in the U.S. Capitol Building or in the adjacent Senate and House Office Buildings when it is not a partisan issue in the rest of the country. 
   I note that earlier the Republican Governor of Colorado signed into law a new background check initiative that is even more rigorous than the one overseen by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Governor Owens said this effort is a balance between ``the public's need to try to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals with the private right to purchase a firearm.'' Let me read what the Governor said again: ``*.*.* the public's need to try to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals with the private right to purchase a firearm.'' It is a balance between the two. He was talking about a balance between the two. 
   If there can be bipartisan legislation in Colorado, why can't there be bipartisan legislation here in Congress? Even in this Chamber, Senators were able to put partisanship aside when we passed the juvenile justice bill last May. The legislation was approved overwhelmingly, by a vote of 73-25. Yet the conference committee still cannot reach an agreement. 
   Is that the problem? The conference committee between the two Houses cannot reach an agreement. The time for delay is over. Our Nation is yearning for leadership. I express my hope, as one Senator, to the conferees to move ahead on the juvenile justice bill. Craft a commonsense bill that would help to break this cycle of youth violence. Show the Nation that the Congress can see what is happening outside the Capitol Building and that we are capable of working in partnership with all Americans to bring some modicum of calm to our classrooms. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New York. I pride myself on being surrounded by very fine men and women who chose to give their time and tolerance and service to the Senate--the only Senate of its kind that has ever been created. Among those Senators is the distinguished junior Senator from New York. He has not been in this body long. He was in the House for a considerable time, so he comes here with a wealth of experience. He is one of the most articulate Members of this body, and I am extremely grateful for the kinds of things he says so many times about me. 
   I think it was Mark Twain who said he could live for 2 weeks on a good compliment. The distinguished Senator from New York has equipped me to keep on going for at least another 6 months. I thank him.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment offered by Senator ROBB today to the Affordable Education Act which would remove the provision of the bill to expand the use of educational individual retirement accounts for elementary and secondary education expenses, and instead expand incentives for the construction and renovation of our nation's public schools. 
   While I understand the overwhelming need for additional resources to help repair and rebuild crumbling schools across the United States, this amendment would strip the legislation of its very admirable intent to assist parents in saving scarce resources for a child's elementary and secondary schooling  years. Parents should have the ability to make decisions about their own child's education, particularly in the early, formative years, as they do with higher education. I believe that the education savings accounts for elementary and secondary education are a step in the right direction in helping families to make these often difficult decisions about the education of their child. 
   This vote on the Robb amendment is a particularly difficult one for me to cast because I, too, am extremely concerned about the dilapidated state of our nation's schools. My home state of West Virginia has a school renovation and construction need in excess of $1.2 billion, and the nation a need totaling more than $250 billion. Mr. President, this is alarming! Our nation's schools are in disrepair and provide a less-than-appealing workplace for our students and faculties. They lack the basic infrastructure to allow our students to become ``ready'' for the age of technology, and many ill-equipped schools deny students the opportunity to engage in meaningful laboratory experiences in the sciences. Some schools are overcrowded, and many have become small communities of portable classrooms. 
   Mr. President, it is my hope that the Senate will revisit this important issue of funding for school construction in a context that would not pit one good initiative against another.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the nightmare of violence in our nation's schools has grabbed our attention once more. This morning, a first-grade student was shot and killed by another first-grader at a Michigan elementary school. Our thoughts and prayers are with the young girl's family, with the young person who pulled the trigger, and with the twenty other students in the classroom. Tragically, once again, the notion of schools as a safe haven was shattered by the sound of gunfire, and we must now begin to face the formidable challenge of rebuilding that serene and tranquil school environment that each and every student and teacher deserves. 
   This tragedy begs some very basic questions of our society. 
   First, and perhaps most importantly, what is a first-grader doing with a loaded gun? A first-grader is six years old, maybe even seven. These are merely babes with sweet young faces who have barely begun their lives. They are still putting baby teeth under their pillows awaiting a visit from the tooth fairy. How did this child get the weapon? And what on Earth possessed the child to bring it to school? 
   What has gone so wrong in our nation that students feel the need to bring weapons to the public school classroom? Do they think they have to show off for their friends? Do they feel the need for power? Surely not a child in the first grade. Do they think that carrying a weapon to school gives them greater stature? I know that we, as a nation, have been struggling with these questions for many, many months, but it is time we started to reach some conclusions. 
   In the 315 days since the tragedy at Columbine High School, the violence has not stopped. We have seen the same tragic scene of students and teachers pouring out of schools in fear in Atlanta. In the District of Columbia, since this school year began in September, 15 public school students have been killed. According to police, eight of the fifteen slayings were precipitated by an argument in school and ended in gunfire on a neighborhood street. For some reason that we cannot seem to get our arms around, our children continue to injure and kill one another. 
   Why in the world are we not concentrating on this? Why is the Juvenile Justice bill, which passed this Senate in May with common-sense weapons controls, still stalled? How many children have to die before this Congress sits up and takes notice? How many lives, so full of potential, have to be snuffed out: 15, 30, 50, 100? 
   We need to find out why these tragedies continue to occur, and we need to find ways to stop it. 
   There will be a supplemental bill coming before this Senate soon which is intended to provide close to a billion dollars in aid for Colombia. The White House calls this funding an emergency. I think we have more than enough emergencies here on our home soil that demand urgent attention. It is time to get our priorities straight. 
   I understand that this is not something that Congress can do on its own, nor is it something that a local school board can accomplish by itself. Putting an end to school violence will take a concerted effort--from lawmakers to parents to students to clergy to community leaders. No one can be given a pass. We all share a responsibility to come together, to look past any historical differences, and to work to find real solutions that will put an end to these tragedies. 
   I only pray that we can. 
   My heart goes out to the family who must be stunned at the loss of their little girl. I can only imagine their suffering. All the potential in one tiny, small, little innocent life has been stolen in the flash of a gun. I hope that this Congress, and I hope that the electronic media, the Hollywood movie stars, the movie industry, and the whole Nation, will finally commit to taking the difficult steps that are needed to make sure something positive can come from such an incredible tragedy. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to congratulate my esteemed colleague, Senator ROCKEFELLER, and his wife, Sharon, on the occasion of the birth of their first grandchild. Laura Chandler Rockefeller was born on Wednesday evening, February 16. 
   February, the second month of our calendar year, is from the Latin, februarius. It is a word of Sabine origin, signifying purification. The Roman festival of purification was held during this month. Nature, in the midst of Winter, with its cold, yet cleansing air, is preparing for the glorious blooms of Spring. And, in this or any season, what can more exemplify the innocence and purity of life than a newborn baby? 
   Laura's proud parents are Senator and Mrs. Rockefeller's eldest son, John, and his lovely wife, Emily. Laura is in good hands. She is blessed with parents, and grandparents, who love her, and who love learning. John is  completing his doctoral studies in English Literature at Johns Hopkins University, and Emily is a teacher. The first, the most profound, teacher we have is our mother. When we first enter this world, in a blaze of light and confusion, in such frightening contrast to our earlier serenity, it is mother who comforts us. It is mother who soothes our cries, who cradles us safely in her arms, and rocks us to sleep. This is the first, most precious gift of a caring mother. 
   I have no doubt that John and Emily will teach Laura the joy, the lifelong comfort, of the great books. The great, old man who raised me, my uncle, was truly the most remarkable man I have ever been privileged to know. He was just an old coal miner. He was not educated in this world's halls and universities. He was a wise man and a hard-working coal miner who played his part in life with a stoic and dignified determination to do his best for his small family, for his country, and for his God. He encouraged me to read, to learn, to develop my mind to the best of my own abilities. As another great man wrote, ``The reading of all good books is like conversations with the finest men of past centuries.'' 
   Carl Sandburg once said that ``a baby is God's opinion that life should go on.'' One of the greatest joys of our existence is to simply hold a newborn baby, especially if that baby is our own daughter, or son, or grandchild, or great grandchild--just to hold a newborn baby that possesses all of the freshness and the newness and the promise of life. We gaze in awe at this valiant little creature, so helpless, and yet so strong, as its tiny, perfect fingers grasp our own little finger with eager curiosity and awareness and pull that finger about. 
 No flower-bells that expand and shrink Gleam half so heavenly sweet As shine on life's untrodden brink A baby's feet.--Algernon Swinburne.  
   In my experience, parenthood is a challenging balance of love and responsibility. It is a tapestry of the finest, and most delicate, weaving. We love and guide our children, and we try to always honor this awesome commitment. And we see a pageant of hellos and goodbyes. Children grow up. They go away to school. They go to work, marry, and have children of their own. And then, there are greetings to new and wonderful additions into our midst. For a grandparent, this tapestry, in the glow of a family's history, becomes more elaborate, more richly colored, and more easily observed. It has been one of the greatest delights of my own life, and in Erma's life, to witness this amazing procession of life following after life, seeing a new plateau rise, new plateau of immortality, a new taste. We wish Senator ROCKEFELLER and Sharon the same happiness that has been our experience. 
   Laura is the granddaughter of one Senator, and the great-granddaughter of another, our greatly admired former colleague, Senator Charles Percy. In these fast paced times, more than ever, grandparents are an essential refuge of reflection and continuity between the generations. They are the living history of our shared past. In their reminiscences of earlier days, in their principles forged over a lifetime of experience and hard work, they offer a unique, valuable perspective of a complex and intricate world. I recall with considerable awe the birth of my great granddaughter, Carolyn Byrd Fatemi, born on March 4 of last year. March 4 in the old days was when the new Congress came into session, and a new President was sworn into office March 4. Now that day is the birthday of Erma and my great granddaughter, Carolyn Byrd Fatemi. It is a joyous, and humbling, realization to truly see oneself as part of that intricate tapestry of successive generations. 
   A new baby, so fragile, so tiny, so soft, so sweet, so delicate, and yet so determined to join this wonderful, maddening world, stirs our hearts and reminds us once more of our enduring link to the eternal. As William Wordsworth wrote, 
 Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting: The soul that rises with us, our life's star, Hath had elsewhere its setting, And cometh from afar; Not in entire forgetfulness, And not in utter nakedness, But trailing clouds of glory do we come From God, who is our home: Heaven lies about us in our infancy!  
   Erma and I also congratulate Senator and Mrs. Rockefeller on the engagement of their daughter, Valerie, to Mr. James Douglas Carnegie. Perhaps the greatest transition in a person's life is when he makes that great leap from ``I'' to ``We.'' It is the beginning of a journey with a beloved partner, who will share life's joys, and ease its inevitable burdens. My own treasured wife, Erma, and I have been on this wondrous journey for sixty-two years, and it will soon be 63, the Lord willing. To Valerie and James, I would wish the benediction of Milton, ``Mutual love, the crown of all our bliss.'' 
   Senator ROCKEFELLER has worked tirelessly for the people of West Virginia for over thirty years. It has been my great privilege to work alongside him in this Chamber for the past fifteen years. He has been a tenacious champion of developing economic opportunities for West Virginia's workers, and a compassionate, determined voice for children, for senior citizens, for our nation's veterans, and for our retired coal miners. I could not wish for a more capable, diligent and congenial colleague. I offer Senator ROCKEFELLER my best wishes on these happy occasions for his family, and also my sincere gratitude to him for his intelligence, his strength of character, and his friendship. 
   Congratulations again, 100 times, on the birth of this beautiful little granddaughter. How proud he has to be. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, The Apocrypha, or the Hidden Books, is a term used to describe the books found in the Alexandrine Greek Scripture (The Septuagint), but absent from the Orthodox Hebrew Scripture. In the second book of Esdras is found the following Admonishment: ``Now therefore keep thy sorrow to thyself, and bear with a good courage that which hath befallen thee.'' 
   There is one Member of this body who seems to have lived his life by that particular piece of ancient wisdom. That Member to whom I refer is the senior Senator from the State of Massachusetts, EDWARD M. KENNEDY. 
   The saga of the Kennedy family is well known by nearly everyone. It is a story replete with triumphs and unfathomable tragedies. Many times, I have marveled, at the resilience displayed by TED KENNEDY and by his family. Somehow they always manage to regroup, to prevail, to go on, even in the face of devastation. 
   I believe they find their strength in the love of each other, and in their unstinting devotion to public service. 
   Senator TED KENNEDY is absolutely committed to public service. 
   He has served and served wisely and well in the United States for 38 years. First elected to the Senate in 1962, TED KENNEDY is now the third most senior Member of this body. 
   A child of privilege, educated at Harvard and the University of Virginia Law School, TED KENNEDY could have taken the easier path in life. But instead TED KENNEDY came to the Senate to work. And the causes he has championed and put his broad shoulder to the wheel to support, are for the most part, the causes that benefit the little people--the poor, the downtrodden, the children in our society. 
   Senator KENNEDY has been an unstinting warrior in the effort to ensure quality health care to the citizens of the Nation. Two recent achievements in this area are the Health 
   Insurance and Accountability Act of 1996, which makes it easier for those who change or lose their jobs to keep their health insurance, and the children's Health Insurance Act of 1997, which makes their health insurance far more widely available to children through age 18 in all 50 states. 
   Senator KENNEDY has for years, also been a dynamic leader on a wide range of other issues of central importance to the people of this Nation, including education, raising the minimum wage, defending the rights of workers and their families, strengthening civil rights laws, assisting individuals with disabilities, fighting for cleaner water and cleaner air, and protecting Social Security and Medicare for senior citizens. 
   I have not always agreed with his solutions to our Nation's problems, but I have always respected his capacity for hard work, his devotion to the causes he champions, and his energetic ability to get things done. 
   And although we have disagreed in the past, one time or another over the years, Senator KENNEDY and I have come to be friends for a long time. We share many things in common, although two more different individuals in background could hardly be imagined. We share a love of history, of poetry, of the rough-and-tumble and the humor of politics, and we share a love and understanding of this Senate and the singularly important role it was intended to play in this Republic. 
   Rarely have I been more touched than when TED personally delivered 80 long-stemmed roses to my office in remembrance of my 80th birthday, 2 years ago. It was a memorable moment for me. 
   Through all the triumphs and tragedies, through all the hard work, the disappointments, and the hard knocks that always accompany a long political career, Senator KENNEDY has retained a young man's zeal for life, for service, for laughter, and for achievement. I believe that his shadow will loom large when the history of this body is written in future years. Already, the sum total of his legislative achievements is 
   enormous, and he is still as active, as energetic and as committed as ever. Fortunately, for this body and for the Nation, we can expect many, many more years of loyal and distinguished service from the senior Senator from the Bay State. 
   So today on the birthday of my friend, TED KENNEDY, I rise to salute his courage, his work, his resiliency, and his extraordinary friendship and kindness to me. 
   And I offer to him this day one of those famous, certainly very lyrical of Irish blessings: 
 May the road rise to meet you, May the wind be always at your back, May the sun shine warm upon your face, May the rain fall softly upon your fertile fields. And, until we meet again,  May God hold you in the palm of His hand.  
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly regarding the late Floyd Riddick. 
   Floyd Riddick was for several years the Parliamentarian of the Senate. Floyd Riddick was born in 1908 in Trotville, NC. That was the same year in which the Model T Ford was made. The Model A Ford came along in December of 1927, but the Model T Ford came on the market in 1908. 
   Floyd Riddick was from that generation of Americans committed to duty, excellence, and hard work. His entire life reflected a love of duty, of excellence, and of hard work. Floyd Riddick attended Duke University. He attained his master's degree at Vanderbilt, and then he returned to Duke University to earn his Ph.D. in political science. While working on his doctoral dissertation, Floyd Riddick spent a year observing the workings of the U.S. House of Representatives. And then, in 1941, he published an expanded version of that research as congressional procedure. 
   For the benefit of the viewing public, I hold in my hand a copy of the volume about which I have just spoken. The title is ``Riddick's Senate Procedure.'' This particular volume, which was printed by the U.S. Government Printing Office here in Washington in 1992, including the appendix, contains 1,564 pages. Mr. President, I have read this book on Riddick's Procedure through and through and through a number of times. It used to be that when I was the Democratic whip, and while I was also Secretary of the Democratic Conference in the Senate, and during the  time I was majority leader, minority leader, and majority leader again, I read this book once every year--the complete book. It is a very valuable book. If one hopes to ever have a fairly good understanding of the Senate rules and precedents, then he or she should read this book. The Parliamentarians of the Senate are very familiar with it. They resort to it many times a day, and it is a sure and dependable guideline with respect to the rules and precedents in the Senate. Doc Riddick--we called him ``Doc''--published a book on congressional procedure. This book is on Senate procedure. 
   He then came to Washington permanently as a statistical analyst and as an instructor of political science at American University. He was a Ph.D. in political science. I never received my baccalaureate in political science until I was 76 years old. That was about 6 years ago. I received my baccalaureate in political science, but, of course, I knew a lot about political science long before I ever received that degree. I am a graduate of the school of hard knocks, and I learned a long time ago the lessons that are taught by service in this body and in the other body. This is my 48th year on Capitol Hill. 
   The late Richard Russell talked with me one day about the rules in the Democratic Cloakroom, right in back of where I am now standing. He said: ROBERT, you need not only to know about the rules, you need also to understand the precedents of the Senate. 
   I said: Where can I learn about them? 
   He picked up this book, ``Riddick's Procedure,'' and he said: This is the book where you can learn a lot about the precedents of the Senate. 
   Doc Riddick--as I say, because he had a Ph.D. in political science, Doc Riddick wrote the book. From 1943 to 1946, Dr. Riddick edited the Legislative Daily for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a post which led to his being asked to set up a Daily Digest in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD which would summarize congressional events and serve as a guide to the daily RECORD. 
   Now, Doc Riddick wasn't the first man who ever thought of that. Julius Caesar developed what well might have been called the legislative daily. He developed a process whereby the daily actions of the Senate would be noted and would be distributed to the various parts of the Roman Empire, and nailed upon walls for all to see. 
   That was a kind of daily legislative digest. That came along quite a good many years before Dr. Riddick's time. But he followed in the shoes of Julius Caesar in that regard in that he set up a Daily Digest in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. It is still to be found in the back of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. In the back of the RECORD there is a Daily Digest, and Senators can go to the Daily Digest and very quickly be informed about the actions of the Senate and the House the day before, and what legislation was passed and how many rollcall votes there were. It is a very valuable compendium of the actions of the Senate and the House on the day previous to the day on which the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD appears in our office. 
   From that position in 1951, Dr. Riddick joined the Office of Parliamentarian as an assistant, succeeding to the position of Senate Parliamentarian in 1964 where he served until 1974. After his retirement, Dr. Riddick continued to serve the Senate as Parliamentarian Emeritus and as a consultant to the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. Do you know what his salary was? Zero. He didn't charge anything for his services. 
   That was a deeply dedicated man who enjoyed giving of his knowledge and talents, his expertise, his experience to other Senators. I have been a member of that committee for a long time, so I am quite familiar with Floyd Riddick and his work on the committee. 
   Most Senators now serving will be most familiar with the name of Floyd Riddick in connection with Riddick's Rules of Procedure. He also authored a series of articles summarizing each congressional session which appeared in the American Political Science Review and the Western Political Quarterly, along with several other books on the organization, history, and procedures of the Congress. 
   I used to conduct a seminar on the legislative process at American University during the summers. I didn't earn much money, but the money that I earned I put into a fund for the college education of a Chinese orphan. I would have Dr. Riddick over to speak during those days when I was conducting the seminar. Dr. Riddick would come over and speak to the class. It wasn't an easy class. It was a tough one. I gave between 600 and 700 questions on the final exam, and I flunked three or four individuals in the class who apparently thought it would be an easy thing to skip when they wanted to. But they didn't make the grade. I had no hesitancy in flunking them. Dr. Riddick, though, was one of those who spoke for me from time to time. 
   I also had Senator Sam Ervin over to speak to my class. I had the late Speaker, Carl Albert, over to American University from time to time to speak in this seminar. I asked some of the officers of the Senate to visit the class. So we offered those young people a real treat in the legislative process. 
   The Random House College Dictionary gives us this definition of the word ``integrity'': ``Adherence to moral and ethical principles; soundness of moral character; honesty.'' 
   That word ``integrity'' is used repeatedly in the publication entitled ``Tributes to Dr. Floyd M. Riddick'' upon the occasion of his retirement and designation as parliamentarian emeritus, which was ordered by the Senate to be printed on December 19, 1974. Senator after Senator, in speaking of the services of 
   Floyd Riddick upon his retirement, used that word ``integrity.'' 
   He was a Parliamentarian who would not be swayed by anybody in the Senate. He called the shots exactly as he saw them. He didn't lean toward the Republicans; he didn't lean toward the Democrats. He called the questions as he saw them, and based them on the Senate rules and upon the precedents. When we received advice from Dr. Riddick while he was Parliamentarian, we knew that was the way it was. We knew he wasn't bending the rules to favor any of us or to favor either political party. 
   So the word ``integrity'' was an extremely well-fitting word for Floyd Riddick. 
   There are some individuals who come up from their origins with a closeness to earth and a nearness to growing things--growing things, the lilac bush, the rosebush, the tomato plant, the ordinary weed, a blade of grass--these individuals have integrity. There is a sort of elemental trueness about them which even the foibles and the follies and the bright lights of Washington politics cannot shake from their being. 
   As Popeye says, ``I am what I am and that is all I am.'' And these people are just what they are and that is all they are. That was Dr. Riddick. Even the foibles and follies of politics in Washington could not shake his being. 
   So it is not surprising to learn that Floyd Riddick enjoyed being on a farm. He used to give some of us here a few of his tomatoes. He grew those large, beefsteak tomatoes, and he would bring them in from the farm. He would give me some in the summer. And there were others who were fortunate enough to be the recipients of Floyd Riddick's tomatoes. And later in life, Dr. Riddick routinely escaped to his farm in Rappahannock County, VA, as if for renewal and refreshment. 
   Rappahannock County, VA--my distant forbear, whose name was William Sale, came from England in 1657 and settled on the Rappahannock River in Virginia. He worked 7 years as an indentured servant to pay for his trip across the Atlantic--7 years. Then he received 160 acres of land. So it was in Rappahannock County that Dr. Riddick had a farm. He loved that farm. 
   Emerson said, ``The true test of civilization is not in the census, nor the size of cities, nor the crops. No. But the kind of man the country turns out.'' 
   This was the kind of man we could emulate. He was a noble soul, Floyd Riddick. He was the kind of man we could proudly call a friend or associate. 
   Emerson also said: ``It is easy in the world to live after the world's opinion.'' That is easy. ``It is easy in solitude to live after our own.'' That is easy. ``But the great man is he who, in the midst of the crowd, keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.'' 
   Floyd Riddick never seemed frazzled, never seemed exasperated by the pressure cooker atmosphere that can and does develop here on the Senate floor.  Even though Dr. Riddick's tenure as Senate Parliamentarian coincided with some of the most difficult and passionate issues ever encountered by the Senate, such as Vietnam and civil rights, he was ever the calm professional, always willing and ready to lift a hand, always desirous of helping especially the new Members who were sworn into this body, always there, too, at the beck and call of the Members who had been here a long time. 
   Such a common, friendly, warm, congenial, accommodating, decent individual! Around him there seemed to be always an aura of peace and control. He kept his mind on his responsibilities, and he never ever forgot that, as Parliamentarian--in effect, the silent referee of Senate debate and procedure--he had to maintain complete and total objectivity. No partisanship--complete and total objectivity. 
   Senators on both sides of the aisle knew it. They knew when they went to him, they would get the straight answer and it would not be colored or tinctured by partisanship. Doc Riddick was in every sense of the word a scholar. He was quiet, soft spoken, unassuming, and absolutely rock solid. That was Floyd Riddick! 
   I leaned upon him heavily in my earlier years in the Senate. He was a delight to work with, and I enjoyed his company. He was one of those completely dedicated selfless people who labored for the good of the institution. He loved the institution. He labored for the good of the Senate and for the good of his country. 
   Robert E. Lee said that the word ``duty'' was the sublimest word in the English language. Dr. Riddick understood what that meant, and, to him, duty was sublime. He was above politics, as I have repeatedly said, he was honorable, and he was entirely above reproach. 
   Floyd Riddick did not need praise, although he certainly deserved it. He did not covet recognition, although the recognition of his scholarly expertise was widespread. For him, the glory of the work, the glory of serving the Senate, the glory of serving Senators, and through Senators the glory of serving the American people, was enough. 
   We will long remember Dr. Riddick, those of us who served with him. Whence cometh such another? 
   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment offered to the bankruptcy reform bill by Senator LEVIN that would prohibit gun manufacturers from discharging debt associated with firearm sales. 
   Currently, the families of victims who have been harmed by a firearm can sue the gun manufacturer for financial damages in civil court. The bankruptcy code allows for the gun manufacturer to file for bankruptcy protection and discharge the debt that the manufacturer may owe to the victim's family. This amendment would prohibit a gun manufacturer from discharging that debt. 
   I am voting against this amendment because, at this time, I have not received significant evidence to suggest that gun manufacturers are abusing loopholes in the bankruptcy code to avoid paying their liabilities. Additionally, this amendment is not narrowly tailored to gun manufacturers who are illegally selling firearms. It targets the industry as a whole, and would set an unfortunate precedent by legally separating this industry from other industries in the bankruptcy code. 
   While I understand the concerns of people who would argue that gun manufacturers are abusing the bankruptcy code, I cannot support the separate treatment of certain industries under our nation's bankruptcy laws absent more significant evidence of actual abuse.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I shall vote in favor of S. 625, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999, in order to restore fiscal responsibility to the nation's bankruptcy code. Last year, a record 1.4 million people declared bankruptcy, which was almost triple the number in 1988 (549,612) and five times the number in 1980 (287,057). That the number of households in severe financial difficulty has risen so dramatically is perplexing, given the prosperous economy, and suggests that some filers are abusing the bankruptcy code to erase debts they are able to pay. The dramatic rise in bankruptcy filings may also suggest  that there is no longer a stigma attached to bankruptcy filers, and that the bankruptcy laws are seen more as a financial planning tool rather than a system of last resort. This bill would curb potential abuses of the bankruptcy code by channeling debtors away from chapter 7 liquidation, where a debtor's liabilities are erased, and towards chapter 13 repayment, where debts are reorganized under a repayment plan. While I am not satisfied that this bill will decrease the bankruptcy rate as dramatically as advocates claim, I am convinced that S. 625 is a worthwhile effort in restoring fiscal responsibility. 
   However, during the bankruptcy debate, the Republican-controlled Senate passed an amendment that would attach $75 billion in tax cuts over ten years to the bankruptcy bill. These tax cuts were adopted in lieu of targeted cuts that would have benefitted low-income and rural families, which I supported, and that would have been fully paid-for by closing down tax loopholes that would force businesses to pay their fair share of taxes. Instead, the Senate adopted a tax package that would not have been paid-for, and would largely benefit high-income taxpayers. This means that Congress may have to borrow needed money or cut spending to vital programs that benefit hundred of thousands of West Virginians in order to pay for these tax cuts. It is almost ironic that Congress attached these unpaid-for tax cuts to the bankruptcy bill. Here we are today voting on a bill that would demand financial prudence of debtors at the same time that Congress is providing for $75 billion in unpaid-for tax cuts. 
   In addition to these tax cuts, the Senate rejected a minimum wage proposal by Senator KENNEDY, which I supported, that would have raised the minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.15 over two years. Instead, the Senate adopted a one dollar rise in the minimum wage over three years that was proposed by Senator DOMENICI. This would effectively delay a pay raise to minimum wage workers, and cost year-round, full-time minimum wage workers approximately $1,200 over three years. I have always supported the minimum wage because of the 11.4 million workers who rely on it to support their families. The two-year minimum wage proposal would have provided an additional $2,000 a year for 11.4 million minimum wage workers. That $2,000 translates into an additional seven months of groceries, five months of rent, almost ten months of utilities, and eighteen months of tuition and fees at a two year college. 
   My hope and expectation is that the three year minimum wage hike and $75 billion tax cut provisions will be replaced with a two year minimum wage rise and more targeted tax package when the conferees from the House of Representatives and the Senate meet in the coming months to work out the differences between the House- and Senate-passed versions of this legislation. Consequently, I have joined with forty-four other senators in sending a letter to the bankruptcy conferees urging that they remove the Domenici provisions and accept the Kennedy proposal.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, let me say a few words. I would like to say more about this man from Wisconsin but time constraints will not allow me to do that. 
   He is the Stonewall Jackson of Wisconsin. He stands like a stone wall. If I had the voice of Jove, I would shout from the ends of the earth. Yet I would not be able to move this man, HERB KOHL, when he takes a determined stand. He has been talking with me time and time again about this issue that is so important to him and the people of Wisconsin. He has been absolutely indefatigable; he has been unshakable, and I salute him. He has stood up for the people of Wisconsin. That is what I like about him. He stands for principle. He stands for his people. 
   I have been criticized many times for standing for my people in West Virginia. Who sends me here? They do. The distinguished Senator from Wisconsin feels the same way. He is courteous; he doesn't talk very much or very loud; but he always listens. Always, when I have had a problem affecting my State in particular, he has listened. I sat down in his office with him and talked with him. So I listen to him. I salute him. The people of Wisconsin have a real treasure in HERB KOHL, and I have a real treasure in HERB KOHL as a friend. I want him to know that at any future time when this issue comes up, he knows the number of my office, the number on my telephone. I will be glad to see him, talk with him, and help him in his fight.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on occasion I have noted the birthdays of some of my colleagues by sharing a few observations about them. But, like those poor schoolchildren whose birthdays fall in the middle of the summer vacation, thus denying them the pleasure of a day of special recognition at school, one of my colleague's birthday falls on a day when the Senate can be virtually guaranteed not to be in session. I do not wish to let the whim of the calendar prevent me from honoring a man whose many sterling qualities compare to his more natally auspicious brethren. 
   Senator ERNEST F. ``FRITZ'' HOLLINGS was born on January 1, 1922, denying by just a few hours an extra year's tax deduction to his hardworking parents. That may have been the only disappointment caused by their over-achieving son, however. Young ERNEST went on to do his parents proud by graduating as a member of the highest honor society at The Citadel in 1942, then serving proudly for thirty-three months in World War II, attaining the rank of captain. Upon returning home, he again took up the scholar's mantle, earning his law degree at the University of South Carolina in 1947, followed by his doctorate of law from The Citadel in 1959. He excelled as a lawyer, being admitted to practice before the South Carolina Supreme Court, the U.S. District Court, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, U.S. Tax Court, U.S. Customs Court, and the U.S. Supreme Court. He was first elected to public office at the tender age of 26, in 1948, to the South Carolina General Assembly, and subsequently served with distinction as lieutenant governor, South Carolina's youngest Governor in this century, and as Senator. I feel sure his parents must have been proud of him. I know that I am proud to have served with him in the United States Senate for the last thirty-two, almost thirty-three, years. 
   The rolling, sonorous cadences of this rich Carolina drawl soften the edges of Senator HOLLINGS's sometimes acerbic observations and acid analysis of bills and treaties. I know of few 
   Members who can so decisively carve up sloppy legislation with so few trenchant observations, so mellifluously delivered, that one still feels that the afternoon is going smoothly and pleasantly. With his background in tax and customs law, Senator HOLLINGS has long been a force on the Commerce Committee, and his energy is felt on the Senate Floor any time trade legislation or treaties are considered. As a member of the Appropriations and Budget Committees, he is well versed in the intricacies of fiscal policy-making. And on telecommunications matters few would dare tangle with him without first arming themselves with unassailable arguments at one's trigger finger, for fear of being completely done in by his quick-draw ripostes! 
   We have been on opposite ends of main street legislative shoot-outs over the years regarding the Balanced Budget Amendment and the nefarious Line Item Veto, but never has courtesy or friendship fallen victim to our philosophical disagreements. To the contrary, we have found common ground in our opposition to unfair trade practices and unequal trade agreements that hurt Americans. On the whole, I must admit I prefer to have Senator HOLLINGS on my side, rather than against, as he is such a formidable foe.  
   I have highlighted a few of my distinguished colleague's many honors, but there is one that still eludes him. For though he continues to make his parents proud in heaven, and his family and constituents proud here on Earth, he remains the most senior junior Senator in our nation's history. At 32 years and 10 months, Senator HOLLINGS has surpassed even the legendary Senator John C. Stennis, who served 31 years and 2 months of his impressive 42 years of service as a Senator from Mississippi in the shadow of the equally legendary Senator James O. Eastland. This record is a testament to both the performance and the endurance of Senator HOLLINGS and his distinguished senior Senator, STROM THURMOND. I know that Senator HOLLINGS wears his title with pride and good humor, and his home state of South Carolina is all the better for it. 
   As these last weeks of this congressional session come to a clattering and confusing end amid legislation, floor debates, and appropriations conferences, I am proud to keep a resolution I made last New Year's day to remember and pay tribute to a good friend and a remarkable, well talented Senator. I hope during his next birthday, come January 1, the year 2000, hidden among the hoopla and hyperbole surrounding the year 2000, that Senator HOLLINGS and his lovely wife, Peatsy, can celebrate his birthday knowing that it does not pass unnoticed or unacknowledged by his friends here in the Senate. 
   So, on behalf of my wife Erma, I say to Senator HOLLINGS these words: 
 Count your garden by the flowers Never by the leaves that fall; Count your days by the sunny hours, Not remembering clouds at all; Count your nights by stars, not shadows, Count your life by smiles, not tears, And on that beautiful January day, Count your age by friends, not years.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I also want to thank the members of staffs of Senators, and the Members, the Senate family who sit here before us every day, who work so assiduously and in such a dedicated fashion. They make our lives easier than they would otherwise be, and they make it possible, whereas it would be otherwise impossible, for us to do the work of serving our constituents. I hope that they will all have a very happy Thanksgiving and very pleasant Christmas. 
   Let me also thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. The lovely lady from Maine sits in the majority leader's chair at this moment; she does the work of the Senate in such a beautiful manner, and who does so with such skill and dignity as rare as the day in June. 
   I want to thank everyone. I want to thank my own colleague, JAY ROCKEFELLER, for being my colleague, and I want to thank the official reporters for doing their difficult work and doing it so well and so promptly and always so courteously. 
   So I thank, in closing, the two leaders who make it possible for all of us to get our work done. They are courteous; they are very helpful. I particularly thank the distinguished majority leader for his assistance in regard to the amendment I offered yesterday and which was cosponsored by my senior colleague and by the senior Senator from Kentucky and the junior Senator from Kentucky, MITCH MCCONNELL, and Mr. BUNNING, and all of the other Senators on both sides of the aisle who worked with me on behalf of that amendment. I thank my own leader for also helping to pave the way for us to have a vote, have the Senate vote on that amendment. 
   When Thanksgiving Day comes and the turkey is being carved and my dear wife of 62, almost 62 1/2 years, and my lovely daughters, their husbands, our grandchildren, and our great grandchildren are all around me, we will think of the blessings of the good Lord, and one of those blessings is that of being in the company of and associated with so many wonderful people who are part of the Senate family every day. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I want to call attention to the fact that today, November 18, 1999, is the birthday of the very distinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, my friend. I would like to say lifelong friend; I just haven't had the pleasure of knowing him all of my life. The day after tomorrow, I will be 82 years old, if the Lord lets me live. So I can't say he is my lifelong friend, but he has been my friend over all the years he has served in the Senate. 
   I wish him a happy, happy birthday. He is a Senator who doesn't look up to the rich. He doesn't look down on the poor. He is a good man on the inside and on the outside. And he is a man who sticks by his principles. 
   He is a Republican. I am a Democrat. But neither he nor I puts political party above everything else. We know that political party is important, but there are other things in this life that are even more important. He recognizes that. His handclasp is like the handclasp of our ancestors. His word is his bond, as was the word of our ancestors. 
   I could say much more. I will simply say he is a Christian gentleman, a gentleman first, last, and always. My wife Erma and I extend to him our very best wishes on his birthday and our prayers and hopes that he will enjoy many, many more happy birthdays. 
   He is rendering a tremendous service to his country and to his State. I hope the people of Alaska realize what a treasure this man is. He works for Alaska every day in the Senate. We know that. He is effective. He is forceful. He is genuine. 
   Erma and I join in wishing him a happy birthday and expressing our good wishes also to his lovely wife, Catherine, and to his children. 
   I yield to the distinguished majority leader.

   Mr. BYRD. Madam President, in the rush to complete work on an omnibus appropriations bill that will attract enough votes to pass both Chambers of Congress without incurring a veto from the White House, a number of important measures that should have been in the conference report have ended up on the cutting room floor. One of those issues is mountaintop mining. 
   I am extremely disappointed at the shortsightedness of the White House, as well as some Members of Congress, on this issue. We had a chance on the omnibus package to right a wrong, to remedy the crisis in West Virginia's coal fields that was triggered by a recent Federal court ruling. But the White House blocked that effort, leading the charge to exclude the proposed legislative remedy from the omnibus bill. As a result, thousands of coal miners in West Virginia, and throughout Appalachia, are facing a bleak and uncertain future. 
   Particularly troubling to me is that the ammunition used to defeat this proposal, the ammunition used to keep it out of the omnibus package, was, in large part, a campaign of misinformation, led by the White House. 
   My proposal is not antienvironment. The White House would have you believe otherwise. My proposal would not weaken or in any way alter the Clean Water Act. Let the White House hear! The White House would have the people believe otherwise. Let me say it again. This amendment which is cosponsored by Mr. MCCONNELL, the senior Senator from Kentucky; Mr. ROCKEFELLER, the junior Senator from West Virginia; and Mr. BUNNING, the junior Senator from Kentucky, would not weaken or in any way alter, modify, change, repeal, amend, or undermine the Clean Water Act. 
   I know the White House has tried to mislead people into believing that it would. It would not. Fie on the White House! fie for attempting to mislead the people. Now, one can honestly believe what he is saying and can mislead or one can mislead with the intention of misleading. 
   All the Byrd-McConnell amendment would do is preserve the status quo until an environmental impact assessment, which is already underway, is completed and regulations resulting from it are issued. That environmental impact assessment was not put in motion by the White House; it was put in motion by a court action last December. 
   No laws would be weakened by the Byrd-McConnell amendment. No regulations would be discarded. The legislative remedy that is proposed by this amendment is not an either/or proposition. This amendment would permit carefully controlled mountaintop mining while allowing work to continue on a broad environmental study that could spur better oversight and more environmentally friendly mining practices nationally in the years ahead. In my book, that is a win/win situation. 
   This mountaintop mining proposal is an effort to stand up for America's coal miners--and the railway workers, and the truckers, and the suppliers, and all who are involved directly or indirectly with mining. This proposal is an effort to stand up for the coal miners and the hundreds of thousands of jobs and the scores of other industries they support. Allowing this opportunity to slip through our fingers would be a grievous mistake. 
   We can't control what the people at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue say. We can't control how they treat America's coal miners. But we can speak up for what we believe here in the Senate. We can send our message to the White House. 
   To get that message across, I hope to offer an amendment. I could speak at length on the omnibus appropriations bill when it comes before the Senate. We could be here another week. We could be here another 2 weeks. 
   They say time is running out for the continuing resolution. Madam President, time is running out for the coal miners and their families, and for the retired coal miners, and their wives, or their widows, and their families. Time is running out for them. The President wants this Appropriations Bill sent to him, in Greece. Indeed! What are we going to send to the coal miners who have been working for this country before he was born? What are we going to send them? 
   I have seriously considered this matter. This issue merits the time and the attention of Congress. I am prepared to give it some time. 
   I don't want to hold this measure up interminably. I want to see action on it. I want to vote. I want to vote on this amendment--the Byrd, McConnell, Rockefeller, Bunning, et al. amendment. 
   So, I take these few moments to speak the truth, to try to set the record straight on the impact of this amendment, of which I am the chief cosponsor, and to give this body, and hopefully the other body, one more chance this year to protect the jobs and the livelihoods of thousands of working men and women in West Virginia and throughout America, and to give the White House one more chance to reverse its current position and protect the jobs of the coal miners. 
   We are not just talking about coal miners; we are also talking about the coal industry; we are talking about other laborers--the truckers, the railway operators, the barge operators who go up and down the Ohio and other rivers. It isn't just the coal miners union that is concerned. The AFL-CIO is concerned. Take another look! Take another look at those who are opposed and who work against legislation that will benefit the working men and women of America. 
   On October 20, a Federal district court in West Virginia issued an opinion in a lawsuit involving Federal regulatory agencies that virtually set off an explosion in the coal fields. Mining companies immediately announced that there would be hundreds of coal miners who would be cut off, and new mines which were in the plans by companies to be built, would be scuttled. 
   In some instances, a new mine costs $50 million; it costs $75 million in some instances; and in some instances it costs $90 million, or more, to open a new mine. What mining company is going to invest $90 million in a new mine when the Federal judge 
   issues a ruling such as this? There is no predictability at all in the future. 
   Before the court issued its opinion, as part of a settlement the mining industry in West Virginia was operating under two memoranda of understanding--two memoranda of understanding that had been agreed upon. Hear this: Two memoranda of understanding. I didn't have anything to do with those memoranda of understanding. Who agreed? Who entered into agreements concerning mountaintop mining? Who entered into agreements concerning mountaintop mining? Who entered into the memoranda of understanding? These were agreed upon by the Federal and State regulatory agencies. Hear me now! These were entered into and agreed upon by the regulatory agencies--both State and Federal--that oversee mining permits. 
   What are those agencies that entered into this agreement? The Federal Office of Surface Mining, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the State Division of Environmental Protection, the Environmental Protection Agency. These are this administration's regulatory agencies. This administration's regulatory agencies entered into those agreements. 
   Let me say that again. Hear me. 
   Who entered into those regulations? Who were the parties to those agreements? This administration's regulatory agencies, the EPA, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of the Interior through the Office of Surface Mining, and the West Virginia Division of Environmental Protection--Federal and State agencies--created these agreements, devised these memoranda of understanding. They weren't created by me. The administration's own Environmental Protection Agency, the great Federal protector of our land, water, and air, helped to write and signed onto these memoranda of understanding. 
   Do you, my friends, really believe that the EPA signed agreements that weakened environmental protections?  
   Let me say to the White House: Do you believe that your own Environmental Protection Agency signed onto agreements that weakened environmental protections? No. No. These memoranda of understanding--called MOUs--put into place stronger environmental protections in West Virginia. 
   Listen to this: These MOUs put into place stronger--get it, now--stronger environmental protections and regulations in West Virginia than exist in any other State in the Union. Hear me, environmentalists; you ought to be fighting for this amendment. You ought to be urging us on in our fight for this amendment. I am an environmentalist. Who was the majority leader of the Senate when SMCRA was passed in this body, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act? Who was the majority leader of the Senate then? Who stood up for you environmentalists then? 
   West Virginia at one time was the only State in the United States that had no wildlife refuge. I put money in Appropriations bills, to bring the first wildlife refuge to West Virginia, the last State among the 50 that got a wildlife refuge. Hear me, environmentalists. Who put the money in for the Canaan Valley Wildlife Refuge--that West Virginia refuge was the 500th in the nation? I did. 
   I am an environmentalist. Who put the $138 million in for the fish and wildlife's national conservation and training facilities at Terrapin Neck, three miles out of Shepherdstown, WV? Who fought 5 years in the Senate Appropriations Committee for that $138 million? Who fought for it in the House-Senate conferences? This Senator; this environmentalist fought for it. 
   Nobody wants a cleaner environment than I do. But I hope I also have some common sense. We know that in West Virginia the great core industries have fueled the powerplants of the Nation, have fueled the war machine of the Nation. The coal industry, the steel industry, the glass industry, the chemical industry, these and other core industries have employed hundreds of people in West Virginia. The core industries are still there, but they are diminishing. There were 125,000 coal miners in West Virginia when I first ran for the House of Representatives in 1952. Today, there are only 20,000, give or take, in West Virginia. 
   These core industries cannot always be what they once were. But there are those who want coal mining stopped now. They want it stopped tonight. They want it stopped tomorrow. Shut it down! That is what they want. But we can't do that. It can't be done overnight. People have to work. Children have to eat. Widows have to live. We have to continue to operate the mines. We are trying to develop other industries in West Virginia--high-tech industries. I have tried to encourage Federal agencies to look to West Virginia for a better quality of life, for a safer life, where the people who work can at last buy a home, where people want to work and will turn in a good day's work. 
   We are trying to diversify our industries. It takes time. I have put appropriations into the corridor highways of West Virginia, so that other industries will be encouraged to come into West Virginia and to expand. They won't come where there are bad roads. They need an infrastructure that will support their industries and their people. It takes time. It can't be done 
   overnight. Those environmentalists who want it done overnight, it can't be done overnight. 
   Those MOUs established stronger environmental protections and regulations in West Virginia than exist in any other State in the Nation, bar none. I say to the Administration, your own regulatory agencies agreed and worked out those regulations, and now you, the White House, want to turn your back on your own environmental agency, on your own Army Corps of Engineers, on your own Office of Surface Mining. 
   Peter heard the cock crow three times, and then he hung his head in shame. He denied his Lord thrice and then hung his own head in shame and walked away. 
   White House, hang your head in shame! 
   But the court's opinion, throw all these things out the window. The MOUs, the agreements that have been entered into by this administration's regulatory agencies, are all thrown out the window. The court ruled that the way in which the agencies were operating did not follow the letter and intent of the law. 
   Hear that. I helped to create those laws. I supported the Clean Water Act. I supported the Surface Mining and Control Reclamation Act. I supported it. But the court ruled that the way in which these agencies were operating did not follow the letter of the law and intent of the law. 
   Congress passed the law. The court disagreed with the way in which the Federal regulatory agencies and the State regulatory agency interpreted the law. But the court was wrong. There are 20,000 miners, 20,000 voices that come from the coal fields who say that the court was wrong. Its decision was completely contrary to the intent of Congress in passing those two laws, the Clean Water Act and the Surface Mining and Control and Reclamation Act. 
   While I disagree with the court, the ball is here. It is in our court now because the judge in his ruling said if application of Federal regulation prevents certain activities in the Appalachian coal fields ``it is up to Congress.'' 
   That is this body and the other body. He said ..... ``it is up to Congress''--and the legislature--``to alter that result.'' 
   So we have accepted the responsibility. The judge said it is up to Congress. We, who are supporting this amendment, have accepted that responsibility and we are trying to do something about it. We are being impeded and we are being undercut by the White House, by my own White House. 
   Almost immediately after the judge issued his ruling, confusion reigned. There was chaos in the coal fields. Layoff notices went out. Mining companies announced that they might not make significant investments in the State that had long ago been planned. That is real money that has to be spent. Those are real risks they take on. As a result of the court ruling, coal companies, truckers, barge operators, railroads--none of them had any certainty that the investments they might make today would be justifiable tomorrow. 
   Some say, it's just a West Virginia problem. You tell the people of Kentucky that. Tell the people of Pennsylvania that. Too bad for West Virginia. But I am here to say to my colleagues it is a national problem. Look out. Look out. That cloud that is over West Virginia is headed your way next, Kentucky. And MITCH MCCONNELL knows that. That is why he is a cosponsor of this amendment. That cloud just over the border, that cloud is just over the horizon in West Virginia. You will be next. And they know it. Look out, it is coming your way next. But if you want to head it off, the opportunity is here with this amendment. This is the time to head off this dragon. Beat it back. Take the sword that I offer, that MITCH MCCONNELL offers, that JAY ROCKEFELLER offers, that Senator BUNNING offers, and all the other Senators whose names are on this amendment offer--take this sword. Take this sword, and fight for the working men and women of this Nation, and do it now. 
   Some may say, ``I would like to. I would like to sign up. I am willing to put on the suit of armor--but what about the environment? We can't upset the environment.'' 
   Let me assure my colleagues and the people who are watching out there--let me assure you, this amendment is not the toxic monster it is purported to be by some of the environmental organizations and by this White House. It is not the toxic monster they purport it to be. In fact, this amendment puts into place in West Virginia--get this--this amendment puts into place in West Virginia the tougher environmental standards prescribed by the very MOUs that this administration's own EPA helped to negotiate. But you certainly would not know that from all of the frothing at the mouth by people who either have no idea what they are talking about, or who, for some reason, are deliberately trying to mislead the people of this country. They either have no idea of what they are talking about or they are deliberately and dishonestly trying to mislead. 
   Those who have expressed opposition to this amendment, including the White House, claim it would harm  clean water protections under both the Clean Water Act and SMCRA. There is not a word--not a word--of that true, and they ought to know it, the people who are saying it. As a matter of fact, as far as I am concerned, they do know it. But they certainly ought to if they don't. 
   This amendment would not harm the Clean Water and the Surface Mining Reclamation Acts, would not harm those 
   protections. This amendment would not lay a hand on those protections. It would not touch--not touch them. It would not even brush up against them. This amendment specifically states --now hear this, hear this Senators--this amendment specifically states:  
   Nothing in this section modifies, supersedes, undermines, displaces or amends any requirement of or regulation issued under the Federal Water Pollution Act commonly known as the Clean Water Act, or the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.  
   What could be plainer? What could be clearer? What could give greater assurance than these words that are in the amendment?

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the White House has pressed for changes in this amendment. The White House, according to Mr. Podesta's letter to the Speaker and Mr. Podesta's letter to me, wants a ``time limited solution.'' This amendment is limited to 2 years or to the completion of the ongoing Federal study which was ordered by a court in December of last year and the issuance of any regulations resulting from that study. 
   The White House argues that because the district court has stayed its ruling, the jobs of thousands of miners in West Virginia and hundreds of thousands of workers in mining and related jobs on the east coast are no longer threatened. The White House is wrong. 
   The court, when it ordered the stay, said this stay has no legal basis. In other words, he said: The only reason I am issuing this stay is to pour a little oil on troubled waters, let the waters calm down a little bit. All this chaos and confusion flows from my decision; I am going to put a stay on that. You can have a little time to get your breath. 
   But he said there is no legal basis for it, which means that the court could lift the stay. When Congress gets out of town, who knows, the court may lift that stay. The court itself, as I say, noted that there is no legal basis for the stay, but, in fact, that the stay was issued in response to the uproar created by the court's ruling. That is why we have a stay. 
   The administration, whose representatives had been working with me on the language of this amendment, said to me there is no need now for any legislation. Do not believe it. 
   The White House argues that because the district court has stayed its ruling, the jobs of thousands miners in West Virginia and hundreds of thousands of workers in mining and related jobs on the east coast are no longer threatened. The court could lift its stay. Let me say again, the court itself noted that there was no legal basis for the stay. 
   We have no assurances as to how long that stay will remain in place. It provides no comfort for coal miners. It provides no comfort for mining companies who want to invest in new mines to employ more miners than their sons. It provides no comfort to others whose jobs rely on coal, such as the trucking industry, the barge industry, the railroad industry, the suppliers. To them, the stay is a stay. It is more like a weekend pass. That stay has placed a cloud of uncertainty, a cloud that hangs over the mining industry in West Virginia, a cloud that is sprouting long, gray tentacles that will stretch across the skies of other States. 
   I ask my colleagues and those who are watching--and I hope the White House is watching--just how many companies do you think are going to sign up to any real commitment of financial resources and invest the millions of dollars that it takes to operate? How many of them are going to sign up with this stay hanging over their heads? Why would they want to? 
   The permitting process was going along swimmingly before the judge's decision. It was going along under the regulations that were agreed to and created by the White House's own regulatory agencies: the EPA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Interior Department through the Office of Surface Mining. Fifty-nine of 62 pending permits could not be approved under that stay. There are 62 pending permits; 59 of these could not be approved under that stay, according to the West 
   Virginia Division of Environmental Protection as of Monday of this week. 
   If this amendment is not adopted, there are those who will point to this day and call it a victory for environmental protection, but those individuals have not lifted a finger--they have not lifted a finger, have not lifted the smallest finger--to help the many residents of Appalachia who do not have safe water piped into their modest homes for their little children to drink. They do not carry banners. They do not carry banners and placards and write letters and lobby Congress about the fact that those same streams they applaud themselves for protecting from rock and dirt are being polluted by the wastewater of communities that are too poor to build sewage plants. 
   These head-in-the-clouds individuals peddle dreams of an idyllic life among old growth trees, but they seem to be ignorant of the fact that without the mines, jobs will disappear, the tables will go bare, the cupboards will be empty, schools will not have the revenue to teach the children, and towns will not have the income to provide even basics. But what do they care? They will have already thrown down their placards and their banners and gone off somewhere else. 
   These dreamers--I know, I have been down there. They have been carrying their banners around some of the meetings that I have addressed. They might as well talk to the trees. I am speaking for the coal miners. I lived in a coal miner's home. I grew up in a coal miner's home. I ate from a coal miner's table. I slept on a coal miner's bed. I lived under a coal miner's roof. 
   Loretta Lynn sings the song ``I'm a Coal Miner's Daughter.'' I married a coal miner's daughter more than 62 years ago. 
   My wife's brother died of  pneumoconiosis. He died of black lung, contracted in the coal mines. And his father died under a slate fall--under a slate fall. He died in the darkness. He died in the darkness. 
   Many times I have gone to the miners' bath house and pulled back the canvas cover and peered into the face of a coal miner whom I knew and who had been killed under a slate fall or killed by being run over by an electric motor. 
   Many times I have walked those steep hillsides and helped to carry the heavy--and I mean heavy--coffins of miners who died following the edict of the Creator, when he drove Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden, saying: In the sweat of thy brow shall thou eat bread. And those coal miners know what that means. 
   But this court ruling will take away the right of thousands of coal miners and truckers and railroad workers and barge operators to earn their bread in the sweat of their brow. 
   Hear me, coal miners! If you do not know now who your friends are, you soon will know. These dreamers would have us believe that if only our mountains--if only our mountains--remain pristine, new jobs will come. ``Or,'' they suggest, ``perhaps coalfields residents should simply commute to other areas for employment.'' To these individuals I say, ``Get real!'' 
   Those of you in the White House, who have been working behind my back on this amendment, go down there and talk to those coal miners. Tell them what you have done. 
   You do not have to drive the dangerous, winding, narrow roads over which these workers would have to commute each morning and evening. 
   When the picket signs are gone, when the editorials in the big city papers are lining bird cages, the people of the small mining communities will be left. You will be gone. You have thrown down your banners. You have thrown down your placards. You have thrown down your candles. But those people of the small mining communities will still be there. They will be left to repair the economic damage. 
   Mining will be part of the economic base of my State for the foreseeable future, and new ways must be explored to make mining practices more environmentally friendly. And I am for that. At the same time, we have to recognize that the amount of coal reserves in West Virginia is finite. We must continue to broaden our State's economic base. But such change cannot happen over night. 
   A new economic base cannot spring from the ocean foam. It cannot emanate from the brain of Jove, like Minerva, fully clothed and in armor. That effort requires time. And it requires money. And if you want to know the worth of money, try to borrow some. It requires the development of improved infrastructure, better highways, more modern highways, up-to-date highways, safer highways, like those Appalachian corridors that I have been trying for years to build, and for which I have been horse whipped orally and with the pen. I do not mind. I know for whom I am working. I am working for the people of West Virginia, and always will as long as the Lord lets me stand. 
   Water and sewer systems, accessible health care, safe schools--these are the kinds of basic facilities and programs that I have been promoting for many years. I do not carry my banner today and throw it down when the speech is over and go on somewhere else. Those coal miners are still there. And they are going to still have my attention, my respect, my reverence. 
   In a letter threatening a veto of legislation containing this amendment, the White House claimed to be prepared to discuss a solution that would ensure that ``any adverse impacts on mining communities in West Virginia are minimized.'' Well, talk is cheap. But any real solution to minimize economic impact on these West Virginian communities won't be cheap. 
   Back in July, the President of the United States appeared in Hazard, KY, where he delivered an address to the people of Appalachia. Appalachia is my home. I was married there. Our first daughter was born there. Our second daughter was born there. I went to school there. I graduated from high school there in Appalachia. 
   The President of the United States expressed great sympathy for the economic distress in these mountainous States. It was an uplifting speech. He is very capable of giving uplifting speeches. It was a speech that reached out to the human spirit and built great expectations. Calling on corporate America to invest in rural America, President Clinton said: ``This is a time to bring more jobs and investment and hope to the areas of our country that have not fully participated in this economic recovery.'' And I say: Amen, brother! Amen. 
   I agree with that message. It is the right thing to do. We should be bringing jobs to Appalachia. We should be bringing new businesses, too. But how can one peddle hope while undercutting the real jobs and businesses that do exist in Appalachia? 
   If we don't act now, if the court lifts its stay, we will be back here a few months from now battling this issue all over again. It may not just be West Virginia then. It may be your own States, Senators. It may be your people, Senators. It may be your families. 
   There may be an appeal of the judges ruling, and that appeal may lead to a more equitable outcome. However, that appeal may simply maintain the judge's decision and put us squarely back where we have been in recent weeks, trying to address the matter Congressionally--trying to reaffirm well-established Congressional intent that has been followed for the past 20 years while striving for improvements in the way mining is conducted. 
   In the meantime, with the scales tipped against them, mining families must hold on to a crumbling ledge. The heel is poised above their fingertips, ready to mash down. 
   We have a pretty good idea who the opponents of this effort are. But what of the supporters? Let me tell you who is standing by us: The United Mine Workers of America; the National Mining Association; the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; the Bituminous Coal Operators Association; the AFL-CIO--hear that, White House, the AFL-CIO--the National Association of Manufacturers; the Association of American Railroads; the United Transportation Union; the Norfolk Southern Railroad; CSX Railroad; the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen; the International Union of Operating Engineers; the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees; the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers; the Transport Workers of America; the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers; the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers; the Utility Workers Union of America; American Electric Power. 
   You see, the environmentalists sent a letter to the White House, and they listed a few organizations that were supporting their opposition to this amendment. But listen to this list, too. This amendment has its friends. 
   I continue with the reading of the list: the Southern States Energy Board; the Southern Company; the United Steelworkers of America; the Independent Steelworkers Union--it isn't just coal miners, you see; these are brothers--the Laborers International Union of North America; the American Truckers Association; the International Brotherhood of Teamsters; the American Waterways Operators; the International Union of Transportation Communications; the American Federation of Teachers; the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees; the American Federation of Government Employees--White House, it isn't just ROBERT BYRD and MITCH MCCONNELL and JAY ROCKEFELLER and Senator BUNNING, PETE DOMENICI, LARRY CRAIG, and PHIL GRAMM, and the fine Senator who sits in the Chair, PAT ROBERTS. It isn't just these. It isn't just the House delegation, the three Members of the House from West Virginia. These are not alone. 
   It is also the National Council of Senior Citizens. 
   These groups--representing millions of citizens--agree with us that a legislative remedy is needed, and is needed now. They agree that there must be a balanced approach. What this amendment does is simple. It establishes a fair, moderate balance between jobs and the environment, while also providing for additional review and regulation once the environmental impact study is complete. 
   It is time to put aside whatever animosity exists between the coal mining industry and the environmental movement. 
   I am not much for making predictions, but I can make this one: the  coming years will bring us more challenges like this, when the environment and the economy must be harmonized. Today is a test of our ability to deal those challenges ahead. 
   This nation can put a man on the moon. Surely, we can adopt a solution to this problem that protects the environment and protects jobs of the coalfields. 
   This amendment seeks to go back to the regulations and the agreements that made up the status quo ante before the judge's order--that is all we ask--the status quo ante agreed upon by the administration's EPA, by the administration's Army Corps of Engineers, by the administration's Department of the Interior, the Office of Surface Mining. That is what we ask. And we ask not only for justice, but we ask also for mercy for the coal miners and the other working people of America.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, when I went up to Rhode Island on Saturday, a few weeks ago, to attend the funeral services of the late Rhode Island Senator John Chafee, the national press people--the Washington Post, the New York Times--who were right on that plane indicated that the administration was supportive of that amendment. That was on Saturday. 
   I had run the language by the administration's representatives, who come  to this hill often. I hoped the administration would support the language. So I was quietly running the language to the administration and certainly getting the support of the administration--if not openly, at least they were not opposed to it. We were working with them tacitly. 
   The very next day the tune changed, and the newspapers announced the administration was against the Byrd amendment. So they flip-flopped over night; they made a 180-degree turn over night. One day I had the confidence of them. They were looking at the language, making any responses they wished to make to express their viewpoint. The next day they were 100 percent on the other side. 
   So I say this amendment is a test. I say to the working men and women of America, do not believe the pretty words you may hear. Pretty words are easy. And I have heard pretty words myself. Watch what happens with this amendment, I say to the working men and women of America. Watch what happens to this amendment. See if the actions of those who say they are your friend do match those pretty promises. 
   I thank my distinguished friend and colleague. I am pleased to associate myself with his remarks. Well done, my friend.

   Mr. BYRD. The distinguished Senator has mentioned my name. The word ``waste'' has been used. The newspapers have repeatedly used the word ``waste,'' saying this amendment that I am sponsoring is to let coal companies continue to dump their waste into the streams. 
   As to the use of the term ``waste,'' the Clean Water Act, section 404, governs the disposal of ``dredged and fill'' materials into waters of the United States. Excess material from coal mines has always been regulated in this fashion as ``dredged and fill'' material under section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
   Judge Hayden in West Virginia, however, determined that excess material from coal mines is ``waste'' and, as such, could not be disposed of in valley fills. 
   For 20 years, the stream buffer zone regulation has not been interpreted as preventing the disposal of excess material from coal mines into streams. Rather, Congress relied on the Clean Water Act to govern this activity. 
   I thank the distinguished Senator for yielding. 
   I ask unanimous consent Mr. SHELBY be added as a cosponsor to the amendment.

   Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I had earlier planned to speak at least 2 weeks on this amendment. We are getting a bargain. I am only going to speak 3 minutes, not 2 weeks. Let me just say this: I made my speech earlier today. I will not make it again now. I urge my friends to vote for this amendment. When God drove Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden, he pronounced an edict: ``In the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread.'' 
   The coal miners of West Virginia and Kentucky and other States of this country earn their bread in the sweat of their brow. But not only the coal miners have been affected by this court's jurisdiction, by its ruling; the truckers, the railway workers, the men and women who operate the barges that go up and down the rivers, the suppliers--these people, their families are affected by this judge's order. 
   This amendment does not seek to undercut, undermine, alter, modify, amend, or repeal the Clean Water Act or the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. I say that on my honor. The other cosponsors and I do not seek to do that. We only seek to put the situation back to where it was prior to the U.S. District judge's order, the status quo ante, which at that time made West Virginia the most strictly controlled State in the Union environmentally as far as mountaintop mining was concerned, mountaintop mining--the strictest in the Union. 
   We want to go back to that, and the regulations that controlled then were agreed upon and devised by the administration's own regulatory agencies--the Army Corps of Engineers, the EPA, the Interior Department through its Office of Surface Mining. 
   This amendment states, so there can be no doubt 
   about it:  
   Nothing in this section modifies, supersedes, undermines, displaces, or amends any requirement of, or regulation issued under, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the ``Clean Water Act'') ..... or the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 ..... as applied by the responsible Federal agencies--  
   Which are the agencies of this administration--  
   on October 19, 1999.  
   So there it is. The amendment has been misrepresented. There has been much misinformation about this amendment. 
   Mr. President, I close by thanking those who have cosponsored this amendment with me. Their names are on the amendment. 
   How much time have I used?

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I know what is in this amendment. I prepared this amendment. I have been explaining it now for weeks. And, upon my honor, there is nothing in it that undermines or undercuts the Clean Water Act or the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, both of which I supported, one of which I called up as majority leader in this Senate in 1977. 
   I know what I am talking about. I have lived under a coal miner's roof, ate from a coal miner's table, slept in a coal miner's bed. I have known the joys and the sorrows of coal miners. I married a coal miner's daughter. I know what I am talking about. I haven't just made a trip into West Virginia and come back to Washington to issue a news report on the State and its people. I have lived there for many years. 
   I will be 82 years old the day after tomorrow. I know what those miners need. I am not misleading anybody. Let me say this to the Senator: That stay he refers to that the judge put on has no legal basis. The judge stated that it has no legal basis. He put it on, and he can lift it the day this Congress winds up its work. 
   I hope Senators will vote for this amendment. There were 125,000 coal miners when I went to the House of Representatives; 125,000 in West Virginia. Today there are 20,000 or less. My dad was a coal miner. My wife's sister's husband died with black lung. My wife's sister's husband's father died under a slate fall. I know the joys and the sorrows of the mining people. I have helped to carry those miners, the heavy coffins, on the steep hillsides of West Virginia. I have not just gone into those hills poking around, and then coming back, and issuing news reports about their poverty. I know what they need, because I am one of them. 
   Those 20,000 coal miners earn their bread in the sweat of their brow. Let's give them a vote. If the Senator from Minnesota had people who were faced with the loss of their jobs, this Senator would vote with the Senator from Minnesota and not say a word about it. I resent anything such as has been said by the Senator about my State and its people.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as daylight hours shorten and brightly colored leaves fall from the tree branches, we gradually descend into the winter season. The master hand of nature, after painting the hills glorious colors, leaves us with a chilly palette of greyer skies, leafless trees, and a long wait before the spring blossoms emerge from their underground bulbs. Although we may feel the bounce in our step that a crystal clear, crisp-aired fall day can bring, with the sun shining brightly as it makes its low arc across the sky, we are reminded during this time of the year of the cycles of the natural world. We are reminded that all too soon, we will be in the quarter of the year naturally suited for hibernation--a season, despite festive gatherings, associated with the death needed for renewal. During this season we celebrate Veterans Day to honor veterans who, with their death and sacrifice, have renewed and sustained the freedom and promise of our great republic. 
   Each year at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month we celebrate the end of the fighting in Europe in 1918 that ended the Great War. When I was a boy, we called this day Armistice Day in honor of the Armistice between the Allies and the Central Powers that ended the horrible trench warfare that had torn Europe apart. In 1926, Congress proclaimed that Armistice Day would be celebrated yearly with an annual observance of ``thanksgiving and prayer and exercises designed to perpetuate peace through good will and mutual understanding between nations.'' 
   After World War II, on June 1, 1954, Congress approved the Veterans Day Act that changed the name of Armistice Day to Veterans Day. I am the only Member of Congress who was serving in Congress at that time who is still serving today. Officially, on Veterans Day, we celebrate and recognize the sacrifices of our nation's soldiers, sailors, and airmen to protect our freedoms during all of the wars and conflicts involving the United States. That same year, President Eisenhower declared that on Veterans Day, Americans should ``solemnly remember the sacrifices of all those who fought so valiantly, on the seas, in the air, and on foreign shores, to preserve our heritage of freedom, and let us reconsecrate ourselves to the task of promoting an enduring peace so their efforts shall not have been in vain.'' 
   From the beginning of our nation, America's sons and daughters have been ready to answer a call to duty. In particular, West Virginians have a proud enviable record of service to this country in the perilous times of war and conflict. Of the twenty-five million living veterans, one-hundred-ninety-thousand reside in the great State of West Virginia. More than ten-percent of the people of West Virginia are veterans who have served our nation proudly--that is more than ten of every one-hundred West Virginians. This tradition of dedication to serving is something I am proud of as a West Virginian. Through the turmoil and change of the twentieth century, one thing has remained constant--the dedication and commitment of our veterans to the survival and strength of this nation. 
   Largely through the might of our Armed Forces, the United States enjoys an unprecedented position of international leadership. Yet, the promise of lifelong health care that this country made to our men and women in uniform has been threatened, not by the aggression of a foreign power, but by inadequate funding. Caring for America's veterans is an ongoing cost of war. As America's veterans grow older, they require increased dependence on health care services. But, the Department of Veterans Affairs cannot be expected to provide the necessary care which veterans will need in Fiscal Year 2000, at the Fiscal Year 1999 level for veterans health care services. Veterans should not be expected to wait in longer lines, and travel farther for services. They must be provided quality service. If we fail in this obligation, how can we justify sending more and more young service members into harm's way? How can we expect our children and grandchildren to volunteer for military service in the future, if we are not prepared to keep promises to veterans today? 
   This year the budget came dangerously close to failing to provide for health care that veterans need and deserve. The Department of Veterans Affairs warned many veterans that they might not be eligible for veterans medical care services in Fiscal Year 2000. The strong need for quality medical care for veterans, and a sense of duty to these men and women who valiantly served, caused me to work very hard to meet the funding level for veterans' medical care recommended by the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs--some $1.7 billion above the Administration's budget request. I would like to thank my colleagues who supported my efforts to raise the funding level for veterans medical care to $19 billion for Fiscal Year 2000. This level of funding will enable the VA to continue to provide quality health care to veterans, and will prevent the kinds of cuts in services that many veterans feared would place their eligibility for care in question. 
   As a nation, we are good about honoring our war dead, with memorial days such as Veterans Day, and with memorials of stone that dot our capital and other towns and cities across the country. We need to be as good to our living veterans. Today, many of our veterans are still affected by the time they spent in service. We can best honor them by continuing to provide a high quality of medical care. We can also honor our veterans by continuing to search for answers to questions of service-related injury, and by providing for those who have experienced such injuries. We must also work to prevent such injuries from recurring. For instance, we must remain committed to pin-pointing the cause of the illness of Gulf War Syndrome. Recent reports issued by the Department of Defense indicate that certain substances our military men and women were directed to take during their service in the Gulf War cannot be ruled out as causes for this syndrome. We must continue to focus our attention on narrowing in on the cause of the symptoms experienced by more than one-hundred thousand Gulf War Veterans. 
   So, this year on Veterans Day, let us reflect on the men and women who have valiantly served our Nation, both living and dead. Upon reflection, we should realize the need to recommit ourselves to honoring veterans, not only with unfurled flags and patriotic up-tempo marches but also by serving them as they have served our nation. As the leaves fall from the trees, and our veterans age and pass on, we must remember that what has always kept the tree of liberty safe and strong through the frost and chill of many brutal winters is the commitment of our veterans to nourish the roots of freedom.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased that yesterday the Senate adopted my amendment to H.R. 434, the African and Caribbean trade legislation, regarding the upcoming World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial Conference in Seattle, Washington, from November 30 to December 3, 1999. 
   My amendment is straightforward. It expresses the sense of the Congress on the importance of the new round of international trade negotiations that will be launched at the WTO Ministerial Conference, and would require the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to submit a report to Congress regarding discussions at the Ministerial on antidumping and countervailing duty agreements. My amendment sends a message from the Congress that these talks are significant and that we will be examining these discussions closely. Specifically, it sends a message to our trading partners that we have no intention of allowing the antidumping and countervailing duty agreements to be nonchalantly relinquished, and that we will be keeping an official record of any discussions on these topics. 
   I am strongly opposed to opening the antidumping and countervailing duty agreements to negotiation, and, therefore, I am very pleased that the Administration reports that it will put forth a U.S. trade agenda that reaffirms trade remedy laws, and, specifically, U.S. rights to enforce antidumping and countervailing duty measures. Nevertheless, we should expect that certain WTO member governments will attempt to weaken the current antidumping and countervailing rules during the next round of talks. Certain WTO member governments will likely attempt to use the antidumping and countervailing rules as leverage against other U.S. priority issues, thus, pitting U.S. industries against one another.  
   Without the antidumping and countervailing duty agreements, I believe that many of our trading partners would not hesitate to flatly dismiss their WTO obligations in order to maximize their own profits. Antidumping and countervailing duty rules offset foreign countervailable subsidies and below-cost pricing schemes intended to harm a U.S. industry. Prohibiting these unfair trade practices is the essence of our most basic trade agenda, and laws to thwart and penalize this behavior were enacted as early as 1897. As in 1897, antidumping and countervailing measures are a vital tool to combat unfair trade. 
   My amendment would help the Administration put forth a U.S. trade agenda at the Seattle talks that reaffirms U.S. rights to enforce antidumping and countervailing duty measures, and that protects these codes from any negotiation. Undermining the right of the U.S. to respond to unfair trade practices will hinder the ability of many U.S. manufacturers, including U.S. steel mills, to fight against unfair trade. It would also undermine a century of work to build a straightforward and responsive international trade system.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, much of the controversy surrounding U.S. trade policy arises from differences in opinion about the economic benefits achieved from trade agreements. Trade agreements, in principle, have winners and losers. In recent years, regrettably, U.S. trade agreements seem to be pitting U.S. conglomerates and foreign policy interests against the traditional American workers. By traditional worker, I mean craftsmen, artisans, and laborers who, in this information age, still actually make things. Man cannot live on information alone--we still need clothes, shoes, dishes to eat from, watches, and tangible items. I believe the underlying issue for the traditional American worker is the question of who benefits from our trade negotiations. I believe that the traditional American worker perceives that a selected few U.S. industries keep winning, while other domestic industries keep losing, and that the promised trickle down of benefits from the winners to the losers never happens. 
   Certainly, this is the case with the trade legislation now before the Senate. The same industries keep losing. Under the African and Caribbean provisions in the bill, the losers will likely be textile and apparel, footware, glass, electronics, handbags, along with canned tuna and petroleum. In this decade alone, the Senate approved two major trade bills, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and in each of these bills the losers were many of the same players. The deemed ``losers'' were workers in traditional industries such as textile and apparel production, footware, glass, electronics, watches, and handbags. 
   I believe that many in the textile and apparel industry understand only too well about the stigma of losing so often in trade agreements. I am bothered by the ``loser'' sign that has been placed on the traditional U.S. workers, and the lack of concern about workers who lose their jobs as a result of a trade agreement. I believe that the so-called ``losers'' in U.S. trade policy ought not to be thoughtlessly discarded. 
   In the U.S. trade policy process, we have become heartless, insensitive, merciless, and numb to the potential pain that these trade agreements can inflict on Americans--on mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, and children. The so-called Trade Adjustment Assistance program falls woefully short in providing meaningful benefits to the workers who lose their jobs as a result of trade agreements, and I hope that members are not fooling themselves about the true hardships that are ahead for many workers as a result of the trade legislation that we are considering today. Yes, today the economy is booming, in most parts of the United States. I hope this state of well-being lasts forever. However, we know it will not. 
   Many of my colleagues eagerly point toward the benefits in the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program. TAA is touted as the sure thing to make a winner out of the loser from a trade agreement. Under TAA, in return for their years of contributions to the local and national tax bases, workers who can prove that their company went under as a result of foreign trade might get a federal extension of unemployment checks, which is approximately $250 a week in West Virginia, and two years of ``approved'' retraining. Possibly, if no ``approved'' jobs are available in the area, these workers might also be eligible for a one-way ticket to another region or state, with a whopping $800 from the federal government to start them off in their new lives. With good reason, most workers do not want TAA. They want to earn full wages, with benefits, and two years of unemployment does not cut it. 
   Advocates of the trade bill proclaim that we have to think about the future U.S. relations with Africa and the Caribbean basin, and that we have to accept the fact that many traditional industries are a thing of the past in the United States. There are numbers of members who dismiss the textile and apparel industries, as sure to go the way of covered wagons or the steam locomotive. Advocates want to make the  case that you are either for the trade bill before us, or against U.S. relations with Africa and the Caribbean. I support meaningful economic development in Africa and the Caribbean, but I also care about what happens to the traditional worker here in the United States that might lose his or her job as a result of this bill, and I simply have not received any reasonable assurance that these workers will receive the support they deserve. 
   From my years in the Senate, I have a very strong viewpoint on accepting winners and losers as deemed by the Administration--any administration--or by the committee of jurisdiction. I can tell you that there are many, many industries that would be at risk, if certain special tax or procurement provisions failed to exist. In my view, the main reason that textile and apparel workers are so-called ``losers'' is because decade after decade we have chipped the tariffs away, allowing our trading partners to enter the U.S. market under very advantageous conditions. This strategy was called free trade, but, in reality, I believe that it was mostly a heyday for our trading partners who had no labor or environmental standards. Regardless, decade after decade, this country has relentlessly chipped away at the textile and apparel manufacturing base, mostly on the grounds that this is a natural procession of development, like the demise of the covered wagon and steam locomotive. My staff informs me that advocates of the African and Caribbean trade provisions actually use the metaphor of the covered wagon and steam locomotive as 
   evidence that this is just the way the world works. I guess someone forgot to educate this group that, unlike covered wagons and steam locomotives, Americans will likely continue to wear and use textile and apparel products! 
   I wonder if members supporting this legislation recall that during debate on GATT only five years ago, we implemented drastic cuts in the textile and apparel tariff rates. We told the textile and apparel industry that they would have to swallow the cuts, but that we would phase the tariff reductions in over ten years to help them make business decisions and adjust to the new rules. Let me repeat that: five years ago this body implemented deep tariff cuts on textile and apparel with the understanding that the cuts would be phased in over ten years. Well, it is 1999, and here we are again, chipping relentlessly away at the nominal base that the textile and apparel industry has left. Does the word of this body have no meaning? 
   Under the African and Caribbean trade provisions, there are U.S. industry ``winners,'' mostly retailers, most notably apparel retail companies, and the bill would help U.S. fabric manufacturers and growers. To those winners, I say ``good for you.'' I know the value of a dollar. I spend my money carefully. I like the benefit of consumer savings from our free-market economy. I have never been against trade agreements on fair trade. 
   I am here to tell you, however, that the consideration of trade agreements should be completed in a serious, deliberative, and scrutinizing manner, as trade agreements have broad impacts, and negative consequences. There has been only one relevant hearing held on this legislation, and that hearing pertained solely to the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act. There were no hearings on the Carribean Basin Initiative, the Generalized System of Preferences, or on Trade Adjustment Assistance during this Congress. 
   While the proponents argue in behalf of the potential long-term benefits that the bill might provide to the United States, the fact remains that this bill lacks real reciprocal benefits for the United States. This bill is generally a foreign aid package financed on the backs of a few industries, such as the textile and apparel industry. Is that fair? 
   It is time for the Senate to be sensitive to the costs of trade agreements. We are preparing to approve a bill that imposes enormous costs on direct segments of our economy. TAA is a start, but it is not the whole answer. I urge my colleagues to put a human face on workers in industries such as textile and apparel, footware, glass, electronics, watches, and handbags. I can put a human face on these workers, and I put a value on their hopes and dreams, and on their future prosperity. 
   I am a product of the coal fields of West Virginia. I have seen what it is to work hard, physically hard, to sweat, and to toil. American workers, traditional workers, are the soul of America. They are the essence of our values. They bleed and hurt as U.S. trade policy tightens around their necks. With proper review, hearings, and consideration, I am convinced that we could find a better way to achieve U.S. foreign policy goals for the fine people of Africa and the Caribbean nations. I support a long and prosperous relationship with our friends in the sub-Saharan African and the Caribbean Basin nations. 
   We need to restore the average American worker's faith in our trade policy. We need to move forward on a trade process that provides fair and equitable treatment to all Americans. We need to recognize that all American workers should be able to depend upon our understanding and regard for their position upon enactment of trade law. This bill is not what we are looking for. It does not do these things. For these reasons, I cannot support this bill. I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I join with the distinguished Democratic leader and other colleagues in cosponsoring the Energy Security Tax Act of 1999. 
   I thank Senator DASCHLE for his leadership in crafting this targeted tax proposal that offers incentives for the more efficient use of a broad range of energy sources vital to the American economy. This targeted proposal has a multiplicity of economic and environmental benefits. 
   I have long been an advocate of programs that encourage the more efficient use of energy. This proposal does exactly that. The United States is a highly energy-intensive nation, and it depends heavily on energy for manufacturing, communications, transportation, and many other purposes. While the United States is currently enjoying the benefits of an expanding economy, that economy demands even more energy. The United States has already invested heavily in the research and development of many innovative clean and efficient technologies that will allow our Nation to help meet these demands, and we must continue exploring these opportunities. 
   This bill provides key incentives to demonstrate and to deploy these technologies, including clean coal technologies, a program that I have long supported. Now that we are at the threshold of a new millennium that begins the year after next--not next year; next year completes the current second millennium. Next year completes the 20th century. It is not the beginning of the 21st. So much for that. 
   Now that we are at the threshold, just a little over a year away, of a new millennium, Congress can and Congress should help to prepare a pathway for the new era of energy and resource use. New technologies should be part of that path. For example, with the use of clean coal technologies, it remains economically feasible to produce electricity in coal-fired powerplants while also improving environmental quality. 
   By demonstrating and deploying these technologies, coal continues to be a viable ``cleaner and greener'' fuel for power generation. Clean coal technologies are American-made technologies that provide a variety of positive benefits for the U.S. as well as other developing nations with large coal reserves. 
   Coal currently provides the energy to generate more than fifty percent of the electricity consumed in the U.S. The Energy Information Administration, an arm of the Department of Energy (DOE), projects that coal will continue to provide our nation with the energy needed to generate more than one-half of its electricity needs in 2020. Equally as important, the International Energy Agency has projected that coal will provide forty-six percent of the world's electricity in 2020. Significant growth in coal use to generate electricity is expected to take place in developing countries like China and India. The challenge associated with the continued use of coal, the nation's most cost competitive and abundant energy resource, is to preserve our nation's energy security while also meeting important environmental goals. There has to be a balance. Also, the opportunity exists to use better, more advanced technologies in those developing countries that will experience increases in the use of coal. 
   The current Clean Coal Technology Program has demonstrated a number of first-of-a-kind technologies that increase efficiency and reduce greenhouse gases and other emissions from coal combustion. As a result, a number of emerging clean coal technologies are ready to be deployed commercially. However, full commercial penetration first requires constructing and operating several early commercial-scale applications. In order to install these early commercial applications, all stakeholders including the designer, manufacturer, financier, and owner will have to face both the technological and economic risk associated with the ``not yet fully commercial'' technology. 
   Development of these early commercial clean coal technology applications will require a new program of limited tax and financial incentives to overcome the associated technological and economic risks that will complement continued research and development (R&D) funding. The required R&D funding has come under the DOE's Fossil Energy Program. The associated tax and financial incentives program proposed here would be limited in scope and timing and the proposed technologies would be required to meet ever-increasing performance levels to qualify for the tax incentives. The U.S. tax code would be amended to provide for: (1) a ten percent investment tax credit; and (2) a production tax credit. In addition, annual appropriations would be provided for a risk pool to offset costs, if any, for modifications resulting from the technology's need to reassess its design performance during start-up and initial operation. 
   Mr. President, another section of this bill provides tax incentives to encourage newer, more innovative steelmaking technologies. Although threatened by a flood of cheap, even illegal, foreign steel imports, the U.S. steel industry still employs some 160,000 workers and forms an important element in overall U.S. industrial strength. It is in the U.S. national and security interests, I believe, to ensure that U.S. steelmakers have the ability and encouragement to remain energy efficient, environmentally sound, and economically healthy. 
   By continuing to make investments in the steel industry through tax incentives, we will be helping to preserve high-paying manufacturing jobs in the United States. Of course the obvious other benefit is its effect on our environment and the preservation of our  natural resources. The steelmaking provisions would provide incentives for investment in cutting-edge steelmaking technologies and allow the steel industry to work with other sectors in the production of more efficient energy through co-generation. 
   In conclusion, I strongly support this targeted tax incentive package. This legislation embraces the belief that the U.S. is a leader in developing energy efficient technologies as well as stressing the importance of fuel diversity. I support the adoption of these tax incentives, which demonstrate that economic growth and environmental protection can go hand-in-hand. 
   Again, I thank the distinguished Democratic leader.

I was in the position to do it during the time I was the Senate Democratic leader. It may have been back when I was the whip. I was able to put money in appropriations bills for clean coal technology. I also thank the distinguished Democratic leader for his kindness and courtesy in allowing me to introduce this bill. I thank him for his drafting of the legislation, and I thank him for his leadership. I thank him for allowing me to be a cosponsor.

   Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. 
   Clean coal technology also provides a very important key to the problem of global warming. I hope that we can interest other countries, such as China. China is in the process of constructing many new powerplants. They are new in the sense that they are newly constructed. But they are old in the sense that they use the old technology, if I may use that word. They depend on the burning of coal in ways that contribute to the deterioration of the environment. 
   I hope these countries such as China and Brazil and India will join with the developed countries of the world in the attempt to do something about global warming. 
   I have lived a long time--82 years, Saturday 3 weeks from tomorrow. And I have seen changes in climate. I don't know much about the science and global warming, but I know that I have seen changes in the climate. When I was a young man, when I was a man in my middle ages, I never saw storms of the frequency and the intensity, floods and droughts that we are seeing today, and seemingly increasingly. There is something going on out there. 
   As I say, I am not a scientist. But there is something going on, and I am concerned about it. But whatever it is, whatever the part may be that it is manmade, can be limited considerably if the developing countries would utilize the technologies that our country through its research and demonstration projects, through the millions--yea, billions--of dollars that this country has spent on research, if those countries would utilize these technologies in the building of their powerplants, they would diminish the emissions of carbon dioxide and the other gases that I think are having some considerable impact upon climate worldwide. 
   I congratulate the leader for this legislation. I hope that we can continue to do research on clean coal technology. I hope, as I say, when countries meet in various places, such as Bonn and Buenos Aires, to discuss global warming, that they will somehow be able to persuade the developing countries 
   in the world to use our technology, because while we are plugging the holes in the front of the boat that we have helped to create through two world wars--by defeating Hitler, and the German Kaiser, and others in the interest of the freedoms that these developing countries enjoy to some extent--I hope that the developing countries would not be in the back of the boat drilling more holes, and thus increasing emissions which affect all of us. It is not a boat only part of which will sink. The entire boat will sink. 
   We need the cooperation of the developing countries. We can help them through clean coal technology and other technologies. 
   I thank the distinguished leader.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate today is a sadder, lesser place. Like many others, I am shocked and saddened by the sudden loss of Senator John Chafee. My thoughts, and my wife Erma's, go out to his family--to his wife, Virginia; his sons, Zechariah; Lincoln; John, Jr.; and Quentin; and his daughter, Georgia. 
   I understand the funeral will take place this coming Saturday in Providence. Senator John Chafee is the eighth Senator from Rhode Island to die in office, the second in this century, since Senator LeBaron B. Colt on August 18, 1924. 
   Since his first election to the Senate in 1976, Senator Chafee was the kind of Senator upon which the smooth running of the Congress has always depended. He was a man of great humor, gentleness, thoughtfulness, and compromise--none of which detracted from his clear views and opinions as to what the best course of action was for the nation. He could disagree with his colleagues and still find a way to move forward on issues that were important to him. 
   This was a man devoted to the well-being of his country, in war and in peace. As others have stated, Senator Chafee served in World War II and in Korea. He also served as Secretary of the Navy. He served in the state legislature and as Governor of Rhode Island before his election to the Senate. He is a man who heard the clear call of duty and of love for his country and its people like a church bell ringing over the gentle hills of his beloved Rhode Island. His acts of faith came daily in his service to that calling bell. 
 His golden locks time hath to silver turn'd; O time too swift, O swiftness never ceasing! His youth 'gainst time and age hath ever spurn'd But spurn'd in vain; youth waneth by increasing: Beauty, strength, youth, are flowers but fading seen; Duty, faith, love, are roots, and ever green.  
   So wrote poet George Peele in the 16th century. But surely John Chafee's 
   sense of duty and his faithful service to the nation will prove equally evergreen, living beyond his untimely demise in laws and legislation that bear his stamp of compromise and caring for even our smallest and most helpless citizens. 
 We live in deeds, not years; in thoughts, not breaths; In feelings, not in figures on a dial. We should count time by heart-throbs. He most lives Who thinks most--feels the most--acts the best.  
   Senator Chafee was consistent in his feelings, in his outlook, and in his actions. He always looked out for children in the health care debates that have consumed the Senate. His love of nature and his championing of environmental causes is well known, but tempered by his sense of fairness and practicality. He supported the Clean Air Act and the Rio treaties on global climate change and biodiversity, but he also supported requiring cost-benefit analyses of Environmental Protection Agency regulations and voted in support of the Byrd-Hagel Resolution requiring developing nation participation and a cost-benefit analysis of the Kyoto Protocol on global warming before the Senate would consider that treaty. Senator Chafee was a principled man. He was true to his bedrock beliefs, but he was not so idealistic that he would sacrifice success for unyielding principle. In doing so, he advanced his causes most effectively. 
   For a man as battle-tested as his history suggests, Senator Chafee was known for his civility and his ability to seek a gentler, more civil path in the often strife-torn and partisan Senate. I have not served on any committees with Senator Chafee, but I was well aware of his ability to work with colleagues from both sides of the aisle to ensure the success of his legislative agenda. This talent ensured that he would be sorely missed upon his retirement from the Senate next year. Upon announcing his retirement plans last March, he made it clear that he was not ``going away mad or disillusioned or upset with the Senate. I think it's a great place,'' he said. I think it was a greater place for his presence. It is merely unlucky chance that he is gone before we could all savor our last months in his company. 
   Now, we must instead hold close our best last memories of this kind and gentle man, crusty New Englander that he was. We must measure the legacy that he leaves in legislation and in the fine example that he set with his life. Only thus can we, in the poet William Wordsworth's words, aspire to ``Intimations of Immortality:'' 
 Though nothing can bring back the hour Of splendor in the grass, of glory in the flower; We will grieve not, rather find Strength in what remains behind; In the primal sympathy Which having been must ever be; In the soothing thoughts that spring Out of human suffering; In the faith that looks through death, In years that bring the philosophic mind.  
   Senator John Chafee leaves behind a rich legacy that honors his name, his State, and the United States Senate. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, according to recent results from the 1998 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), only about a quarter of fourth, eighth, and twelfth graders write well enough to meet the ``proficient'' achievement grading level, and a measly one percent of students attained the ``advanced'' grading level. Approximately six out of ten pupils reached just the ``basic'' level--defined as ``partial mastery'' of writing skills by the National Assessment of Educational Progress exam. 
   What startling results, Mr. President! How do we expect our nation to forge ahead in a global economy with a ``partial mastery'' of writing skills? From the typical thank-you note to a cover letter for a job opening to a simple exchange with friends over the Internet, writing is a skill essential to everyday existence, no matter what path in life one may choose to pursue. The power of words and the blending of thoughts in a succinct, clear, and grammatically correct manner is often a daunting endeavor, and one that is too easily dismissed with a poor letter grade or a critical evaluation by a mentor or coworker. 
   The path to becoming a solid writer is a long and arduous road. I continue to improve my writing skills each day through reading and through practice. As the old saying goes, ``practice makes perfect.'' Well, Mr. President, this dictum does not just apply to perfecting your baseball swing or your tennis serve. It is an edict we all ought to follow with a little greater will and fortitude in all of life's quests. 
   What makes someone a better writer? Lots of things, I say, but perhaps a strong foundation is the most critical, and often the most neglected, step along the way. Today's children are ripe with great ideas and creativity, but without proper instruction and strong reading skills, bright promise fades into fractured thoughts and misspelled words on paper. Based upon the results of the 1998 NAEP test, students who did well tended to be those who planned out their compositions and had teachers who required practice drafts. Moreover, youngsters from homes filled with books, newspapers, magazines, and encyclopedias had higher average scores. 
   So often, we hear students gripe about burdensome summer reading lists, and even more 
   shockingly, we witness parents encouraging their children to buy the ``Cliff Notes'' of the book to provide them with the basic character and plot summaries while avoiding the hefty task of reading the novel from cover to cover. What nonsense! Perhaps, the greatest benefit of a child's summer agenda is reading. Skimming and reading shortened versions or the so-called ``Cliff Notes'' rob children of wonderful learning experiences. 
   Reading is an essential ingredient to enhancing one's writing skills. From enjoying the morning newspaper over a cup of coffee to reading an educational magazine or a novel, one can benefit greatly from this endeavor. Given the expansive English vocabulary, there is much to learn from different styles of writing. How often does a person come across an unfamiliar word or phrase in reading? Quite often, I suspect. But how often does the person actually interrupt their reading to consult the dictionary for the word's definition or origin? Not very often, I venture to guess. An appreciation of the soaring majesty of the English language is the  key to unlocking one's own writing skills and letting one's own words take wing. 
   I am pleased to be a cosponsor this year of S. 514, legislation to reauthorize the National Writing Project. The National Writing Project (NWP) is the only federally funded program that specifically works to improve a student's writing abilities and provide professional development programs in the area of writing instruction for classroom teachers. This program operates on a ``teachers teaching teachers'' model, meaning that successful writing teachers conduct workshops for other teachers in the schools during the school year to improve overall writing skills. It is critically important that our nation have skilled teachers in the area of writing, and this program goes straight to the heart of that. West Virginia is home to three federally funded National Writing Projects, including programs at West Virginia University and Marshall University. 
   The act of writing is itself an art, one which not only requires creativity, but one that can also glisten with beauty. Calligraphy, for example, is a beautiful form of writing, very popular in formal invitations and for special events. And while most of us are not gifted calligraphers by nature, we all ought to take a little more pride in the presentation of our writing. A beautifully worded poem or essay can be easily tarnished by poor penmanship. Conversely, good penmanship can enhance the overall beauty of one's writing by simple finishing touches, beginning with the dotting of our i's and the crossing of our t's. It is very easy to become sloppy in one's writing, but we must not forget that appearance does matter, and a good essay that is illegible will have little impact. 
   Sadly, today's young generation seems to be more happily occupied with a telephone in one hand and a television remote control in the other than with a book or a newspaper. I fear that the entertainment luxuries of the twentieth century have misplaced the old-fashioned art of reading and writing. Computer electronic mail too often has become a replacement for a hand-written thank-you letter to a deserving colleague or peer. Reading from Plutarch's ``Lives,'' Homer's ``The Iliad'' and ``The Odyssey,'' or a Shakespearean play has taken a backseat to video games and Hollywood movies. 
   I challenge all of us to set higher standards in our reading and writing skills, and to help our young people do the same. Put down the remote control and pick up a good book. Write a poem for a friend on her birthday. Poetry is a wonderful gift--such heartfelt thoughts on paper tend to last much longer than a piece of clothing exhibiting the latest fashion trend. Embrace the English language and take pride in each word that you place on paper--after all, your writing is a reflection of you. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, earlier today I voted against tabling a sense of the Congress amendment proposed by Senator HARKIN regarding the Supreme Court's 1973 decision in the case of Roe v. Wade. Because that vote was, to the best of my recollection, the first time the Senate has directly and specifically addressed the issue of the Court's ruling, I wish to take a few moments to explain my position for the benefit of my constituents in West Virginia. 
   First, despite the fact that I supported the Harkin amendment, I reiterate that I am, as I always have been, personally opposed to abortion, with few exceptions--such as when the life of the woman would be endangered, or in cases of incest or rape, when promptly reported. 
   However, the reality of the situation is that the decision of the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade is the law of the land. No matter what I think personally of the procedure in question, I accept the fact that the Court, in a 7-to-2 ruling, has definitively spoken on this matter. Accordingly, I felt it was appropriate to support the language of the Harkin amendment.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I cannot support amendment No. 2323, offered by the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, Ms. LANDRIEU. I appreciate her concern regarding the devastating financial impact that having a special-needs child can place on working families. 
   However, I am also mindful of the fact that, as we strive to complete our budgetary work, nearly all Members have agreed that we should do so without using Social Security Trust Fund surpluses or raising taxes. Despite the fact that this is a sense of the Congress amendment and therefore has no statutory consequence, I am nevertheless concerned with the unknown financial consequence that a commitment of this magnitude could have. For that reason, I am constrained to oppose the Landrieu amendment.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Fiscal Year 2000 VA/HUD Conference Report (106-161) contains bill language regarding implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. This bill language is identical to bill language included in the Fiscal Year 1999 VA/HUD Conference Report (105-769). I would like to ask the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the VA/HUD Subcommittee two questions to clarify their understanding of this provision. 
   I note that last year, the conferees carefully crafted bill and report language that clearly addressed the concern that the Administration does not implement the Kyoto Protocol through domestic regulatory action before the Senate gave its advice and consent to the Protocol. At the same time, the conferees clarified that they did not intend to jeopardize ongoing, voluntary programs. These voluntary programs have numerous benefits and are consistent with our treaty commitments under the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, ratified by the U.S. in 1992. 
   In the Fiscal Year 2000 VA/HUD Appropriations bill (S. 1596), the Senate included bill and report language that remains consistent with last year's bill and report language. By doing so, the Senate believes that this language provides the necessary consistency and prohibits only funding for proposing or issuing federal regulatory action called for solely to implement the Kyoto Protocol. These programs have long had the support within both the public and private sectors, and thus it makes both economic and environmental sense that we take this course. 
   It is, therefore, my understanding that, like last year, the provision in question is not intended to restrict ongoing, voluntary programs or activities that, in their entirety, help to improve air quality standards, increase energy efficiency, develop cutting-edge technologies, and reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. Is my understanding correct? 
   As you also know, the Senate has clearly expressed its bipartisan view regarding the Kyoto Protocol in S. Res. 98, adopted unanimously by the Senate on July 25, 1997. That resolution calls on the Administration to achieve commitments from developing countries, especially the largest emitters, as well as protect U.S. economic interests by emphasizing market-based mechanisms and the use of energy efficient technologies. Is my understanding correct that this provision would not prohibit the Administration from working to achieve S. Res. 98?

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this afternoon the Senate is scheduled to vote on final passage of the fiscal year 2000 Department of Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. It is critical that we complete action on this bill today to speed assistance to American farmers in need. Therefore, I shall vote for the bill and urge my colleagues to support it also. 
   The severe drought that has gripped the Eastern United States this year is, by all accounts, the most damaging and prolonged such occurrence since the early 1930s. Just like that period nearly 70 years ago, springs have gone dry, streams have ceased to flow, pastureland and crops have broiled in the relentless Sun until all possible benefits to livestock or man have burned away. In the 1930s the drought turned much of our Nation's farmlands into a veritable dust bowl. Modern conservation practices today may have helped to reduce the erosion by wind,  but the soil is just as dry, and farmers in West Virginia and all along the East Coast are suffering from the natural disaster of a generation. Some farmers have had to make the painful decision to sell off their livestock or to give up farms that have been in their families for generations. This is what has been happening in West Virginia. This is nothing short of an emergency. It demands our attention and response. 
   This bill provides funding for many ongoing and long running programs as well as much needed assistance to farmers who suffered at the hands of Mother Nature this year. The $8.7 billion emergency package that is attached to this appropriations bill contains $1.2 billion specifically for 1999 natural disasters, including drought. In all, more than $1.2 billion will be available for direct payments for farmers suffering crop and livestock losses from natural disasters this year, up significantly from the $50 million in the version that first passed the Senate in August. That may not be enough to fully cover the still-mounting losses to farmers, but it is a good start. These emergency funds will be able to be distributed upon enactment of this legislation to farmers who have been waiting and waiting for the Federal Government to deliver. American farmers cannot afford to wait any longer for Federal assistance, and the Senate cannot afford to delay final passage of this fiscal year 2000 Agriculture Appropriations Conference Report. 
   Unfortunately, once this measure reached the conference committee, the process that we follow yearly as routine in conferences was sidelined. When difficult issues came before the conference, after only an evening and a morning of debate, the conference committee adjourned for lunch, and never returned. For several days, the conference was ``out to lunch,'' until deals could be reached behind closed doors guided by invisible hands, and our tried and true procedure was circumvented. I believe that this selective bargaining is why some Members have expressed their dissatisfaction with the final bill. The best work of the Congress is demonstrated when, as a body, we cooperate and allow ourselves to be guided by the rules and the traditions that have allowed our Government to flourish under the Constitution now for over 200 years. 
   I have stood before this body on numerous occasions since visiting West Virginia with the Secretary of Agriculture on August 2 of this year to impress upon my fellow Members what a significant impact the drought has had in West Virginia, and, of course, in other Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern States. Many of these States received a secretarial emergency declaration that has provided some limited USDA assistance to farmers who have experienced losses as a result of the drought. But, unfortunately, much of the assistance came in the form of loans to farmers who were already deep in debt. The recent losses caused by Hurricane Floyd make clear that more emergency assistance will be needed. We can do better for farmers, so I supported the Statement of Managers language directing the administration to conduct full estimates of the remaining need, and to submit to the Congress a supplemental budget request as soon as possible for both hurricane and additional drought assistance. 
   When we consider all of the natural disasters that have affected farmers this year, from frosts that killed citrus trees, to devastating drought, to States ravaged by storms, and by the hurricane, I feel that it is highly appropriate that the Senate act now because it seems a certainty that the $1.2 billion will be insufficient to help farmers who have been harmed by nature. But the current emergency package attached to the conference report is essential to begin addressing the crisis in rural America that has only been compounded by the weather disasters of 1999. Failure to pass this measure will only allow the suffering of struggling farmers to continue without relief. 
   The House of Representatives passed this measure on October 1, 1999. It is now time for the Senate to pass this measure. 
   I want to thank Senator COCHRAN in particular for his study and consideration and for the skill with which he has brought this bill to its present status. I want to thank him also for supporting some of my requests in the bill. 
   I requested that there be grants to farmers, livestock farmers in particular, in the amount of $200 million and also that there be provisions whereby farmers could restore their land, where there could be new vegetation planted so that they could have a chance of starting over again. It was in that conference that the chairman, in particular, supported my effort. 
   I was one of the three Democrats on this side who signed the conference report, and did so in particular because of the funding which had been provided, at my request, for the livestock farmers. There are livestock farmers in my State who were selling out their entire herds, not just for this year but for good. Some of those livestock farmers have been in the farming business for years, and the farm indeed has come down to them after one or more generations. It is important not only from the standpoint, I think, of helping these people who are so in need and who have to work every day, 365 days a year, who can never be sure what the weather is going to be, and who are at the mercy, in many instances, of Mother Nature--it is important that we come to their aid--it is also important for our country that we continue to sustain the small farmer. 
   In the Roman Republic, the small farmers left their farms in the Apennine Mountains and went into the cities and joined with the mob. When those farmers, those peasants of the land in Italy, left the land and migrated into the cities, the Roman republic began to collapse. It was in the homes of the Roman farmers that family values and the Roman spiritual values flourished. When those peasants left the land, the spiritual values of the Romans began to deteriorate because it was in the homes that they venerated their ancestors and worshipped their gods. They were pagan gods, but the Romans worshipped those gods. 
   Those family values, which included respect for authority and order--there is where the stern Roman discipline had its beginning. It was because of that stern Roman discipline that came out of the homes of the peasants--it was because of that stern Roman discipline that the Roman legions were able to conquer the various other nations around the Mediterranean basin. 
   It was the same way in our own country in colonial days. Most of the people in this country were from farming stock. There was a time when over 90 percent of the people in this country were from the farms. That day has long gone, as the corporate farms have largely taken over, just as in the Roman Republic, the latifundia--large corporate farms--which were owned mostly by Roman senators, pushed the small farmers off the land. 
   I suppose Oliver Goldsmith had that in mind when he wrote ``The Deserted Village.'' In his lines, he told the story of the Roman farmers as well as our own people. 
 Ill fares the land, to hast'ning ills a prey, Where wealth accumulates, and men decay: Princes and lords may flourish, or may fade; A breath can make them, as a breath has made: But a bold peasantry, their country's pride, When once destroy'd, can never be supplied.  
   I thank all Senators for listening. I hope Senators will soon vote for this important bill. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I say what I am about to say without rancor. I hope I can. 
   I have been in this body now 41 years at the end of this year. I was majority leader for 4 years, then minority leader for 6 years, and then majority leader for 2 more years. 
   Mr. President, as majority leader, and as minority leader, I never once objected to a Senator's request to speak for a few minutes--15 minutes in my case today--nor do I ever expect to object to another Senator's request to speak. My request was for only a short amount of time. The distinguished majority leader objected. He has a perfect right to object. I don't question his right to object. But, Mr. President, I think we have come to a very poor pass in this Senate when Senators can't stand to hear a Senator speak for 15 minutes. Our forefathers died for the right of freedom of speech. I may not agree with what another Senator says, but, as someone else has said, I will defend to the death his right to say it. 
   Mr. Leader, I very much regret that you objected to my request to speak for 15 minutes. I don't get in your way in the Senate often. 
   Mr. President, I want to adhere to the rules. I don't get in the distinguished majority leader's way very often. He doesn't find me objecting to his requests. I know he has great responsibilities as the majority leader of the Senate. He has a heavy burden. Having borne that burden, having borne those responsibilities, I try to act as I should act in my place and let the two leaders run the Senate. I don't cause the majority leader much trouble here. He will have to say that. He will have to admit that. I don't get in his hair. I don't cause him problems. But, Mr. President, when a Senator, the senior Senator of the minority asks to speak for 15 minutes, I think it has to be offensive, not only to this Senator but to other Senators. 
   I would never object, Mr. Majority Leader, to a request from your side. Suppose STROM THURMOND had stood to his feet. He is the senior Member of this body. I think there has to be some comity. I think it comes with poor grace to object to a senior Member of the Senate 
   who wishes to speak before a critical vote. 
   Now, the majority leader said in his opinion, or something to that effect, that I could speak after the motion had been decided upon, and there would be time allowed under the order, and there would be time then to make a speech. That was his opinion. 
   In this Senator's opinion, this Senator felt that it was important for this Senator to speak at that time. Not that I would have changed any votes, but I think I had the right to speak. What is the majority leader afraid of? What is the majority leader afraid of?

   Mr. BYRD. I will yield in a moment. I will accord the Senator that courtesy. 
   Mr. President, what is the majority leader afraid of? Is he afraid to hear an expression of opinion that may differ from his? As majority leader, I never did that. When I was majority leader, I sought to protect the rights of the minority. That is one of the great functions of this Senate, one of its reasons for being. I would defend to the death the right of any Senator in this body to speak. Fifteen minutes? Consider the time we have spent. We haven't spent a great deal of time on this treaty. I regret very much the majority leader saw fit to object to my request to speak. 
   Now, I am glad to yield to the distinguished majority leader. Mr. President, I ask that my rights to the floor be protected. I am not yielding the floor now.

   Mr. BYRD. If the distinguished majority leader will listen, I want his attention. I don't want to say anything behind his back. He might be offended. I want him to hear what I say and be able to respond to it. 
   Mr. President, the distinguished majority leader spoke about how long he served in the House. That had nothing to do with my request for 15 minutes. I served in the Senate 30 years before the distinguished majority leader ever got to the Senate. Two-thirds of the Members of this Senate have never served with me when I was majority leader in this Senate. Two-thirds. I am not interested in what the rules of the House are. I served over there. 
   I am interested in free speech, freedom of speech. May I say, in response to the distinguished majority leader, I know what the rules are. I know that the motion to return to executive session is not debatable. I know that very well. Mr. President, the distinguished majority leader alluded to an extension of debate on this treaty--something to the effect that he had heard there were going to be efforts to extend that debate. I am not one of those. I wasn't part of that, and I never heard of it. So help me God, I had no desire to extend the debate. I wanted to say something about that motion, not just about the treaty. I wanted to speak before the motion. I was denied that right--not that I would have changed any votes, but it is my right as a Senator. 
   There is too much of what the House does that we don't need to do in this Senate. I am afraid that too many Senators feel that we need to be like the House. This Senate exists for the protection of the minority, for one thing. It also exists to allow Members to speak freely and to their heart's content. I understand unanimous consent agreements. I have probably gotten more unanimous consent agreements than any other majority leader that ever was a part of this Senate. I walked in the Senator's shoes. I walked in the majority leader's shoes. But never--never--would I object to a Senator asking for 15 minutes to 
   speak on a motion, notwithstanding the fact that the rules preclude debate. That is why unanimous consents have to be made. You have to get unanimous consent to speak in a situation like that. I was denied that. 
   Mr. President, this Senate needs to remember that we operate here by courtesy. We have to be courteous to one another. We have to remember that we work together for the country, we work for the Senate; and it is going to take cooperation and understanding. I try to be a gentleman to every Senator in this body. I don't think there is any Senator who can say I have not been a gentleman to him in my dealings with him or her. The Senate is for two main purposes; there are two things that make the Senate different from any other upper body in the world--the right to amend, which this side is often denied, and which I never denied. If there were 50, 60, or 70 amendments, I said find out from both sides how many Senators wanted to offer amendments and then we will try to get consent that there be no other amendments, and vote. So there is the right to amend and the right to speak--freedom of speech. As long as Senators may stand on their feet and speak as long as they wish, the liberties of the American people will be assured. 
   Mr. Leader, I will not carry this. I have said my piece today. I am offended by what the majority leader did, but I am going to forgive him. I am. I don't live with yesterday regarding relations in this Senate. I think too much of the Senate. That is why I am running again; I think too much of the Senate. I could retire and receive $21,500 more annually in my retirement than I will earn as a Senator. Besides, I could be free to take another job. But it isn't money that I seek; it isn't wealth that I seek. I love this Senate. I am a traditionalist. I live by the traditions of the Senate. I try to live by the rules of the Senate. I try to remember that if I offend a Senator today, he may be the very Senator who will help me tomorrow. I try to remember that. I try to make that a practice. 
   The majority leader made a mistake, if I may respectfully say so. But I will not hold that against him. I will shake  his hand when this is over, because first, last, and always I try to be a man, one who can look in the eye of my fellow man and, if I have done him wrong, I want to apologize to him before the Sun sets. That is my creed. We need to have better comity than we are having in the Senate--not that I will be a problem. But the American people are watching. They see this. And the majority leader has the votes. He doesn't have to be afraid of a motion the minority might make. He doesn't have to care what the minority may say. Nobody needs to be afraid of an opinion I might express before a vote. And no time is saved by it, as we now see. No time is saved. (Laughter) 
   If I had any real ill will in my heart, I would take the rest of the afternoon to speak, and maybe more. But I thank the majority leader for his kindness to me in the past. I understand his problems. I don't want to get in his way. I have said things behind his back that were good. I have talked about the attributes of this leader behind his back. And anything I say today, that is all; I am getting it off of my heart. The majority leader, I think, will contemplate what has been done here today and, in the long run--if I may offer a little bit of wisdom that I possess from my 41 years of experience in this body--he will be just a little less relentless in his drive to have the majority's will uncontested. 
   Remember, there will come a day when he will need the help of the minority. The minority has been right in history on a few occasions and may be right again. The day may come when the minority in the Senate of today will be the majority of tomorrow. If I am still living and in this Senate at that time, I will stand up for the rights of the minority because that is one of the main functions of the Senate. 
   Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished majority leader if he wishes to respond to anything I said.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. 
   Mr. President, I regret that the Senate has arrived at this juncture, that we are forging ahead with a vote that many, if not most, of us believe is ill-timed and premature. The outcome is a foregone conclusion--the Senate will reject the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I sincerely hope that this vote is being driven by something other than pure partisan politics, but for the life of me, I fail to see it. Nevertheless, here we are, and vote, it appears, we will. 
   In the consideration of a matter as important as a major arms control treaty, we need, at a minimum, sufficient time to examine the issue, sufficient opportunity to modify the treaty, and last, but not least, the answers to a few basic questions. 
   First, do we support the objectives of the treaty? In the case of the CTBT, I think it is quite possible that a large majority of the Senate does support the goal of banning live nuclear weapons tests worldwide. I suspect that the 80 percent or more approval ratings that we hear in reference to this treaty are based on that question. 
   Second, is the treaty in the national security interests of the United States? Would the security of the United States be enhanced if we could flash-freeze the practice of nuclear weapons testing worldwide, or are we leaving ourselves frozen in time while other nations march forward? Given our vast superiority in both numbers and technology over other nations, including Russia, it would seem that a freeze on testing could be an advantage to the United States, if--and it is a big if--other nations fully respect the treaty. 
   Third, does the treaty accomplish its objectives? This is where the questions become more difficult. Verification is a legitimate issue, as is the security of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile. What will the impact be on our national security if some countries cheat on the treaty, and others simply refuse to ratify it? Can we really trust an untested Stockpile Security Program to maintain our arsenal of nuclear weapons, and what signal will we be sending to the rest of the world if we find flaws in the program or in our weapons, flaws that mandate live testing to fix the weapons? These types of questions require time and research to fully explore. We have neither the time nor the information we need on this treaty. 
   Finally, can the treaty be improved by the addition of amendments, reservations, understandings or the like? Few documents that come before this body are perfect, and treaties are no exception. It is easy to criticize, easy to find fault, easy to point out the flaws--it is much easier to renounce a piece of legislation or a treaty than to improve it. We have heard a fair amount of discussion about the safeguards to be attached to this treaty. That is all well and good, but I wonder if they are good enough. I wonder how much scrutiny Senators have really given those safeguards. Could they be improved, or perhaps expanded? Maybe we need more safeguards. The point is, under these circumstances, we do not have the ability to fully explore ways to strengthen this treaty, and perhaps make it acceptable to more Senators. 
   A treaty of this nature--one that would bar the United States from testing its stockpile of nuclear weapons in perpetuity--deserves extensive study, careful debate, and a floor situation that allows for the open consideration of amendments, reservations, or other motions. 
   Treaties of this importance, of this impact on the Nation, are not to be brushed off with a political wink and a nod. Treaties of this importance must be debated on the basis of their merits, not calibrated to the ticking of the legislative clock. 
   As the distinguished ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator BIDEN, noted on Friday, in comparison with Senate consideration of other national security treaties, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty has been given short shrift indeed. The 1988 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), which was considered during a time in which I served as Majority Leader, was the subject of 20 hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 12 hearings before the Senate Armed Services Committee, a number of hearings in the Intelligence Committee, and eventually, nine days of Senate floor debate. The SALT II Treaty, which again was considered when I was Majority Leader, was the subject of 21 hearings by the Foreign Relations Committee, and nine hearings by the Armed Services Committee before President Carter and I reached agreement in 1980 that, as a result of the seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran, 
   consideration of the treaty should be suspended. 
   The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is of equal importance and deserves the same consideration as those earlier treaties affecting our national security. Senator WARNER and Senator LEVIN, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committees, and their respective staffs, did a yeoman's job in scheduling three back-to-back days of hearings on the Treaty last week. They managed to wedge an enormous amount of information into a remarkably brief window of opportunity. They deserve our thanks and our commendations. 
   But what are we left with at the end of the process? What we are left with is a cacophony of facts, assessments, and opinions. Few in this chamber are steeped in the intricacies of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I am not. Few of us have a full enough understanding of the treaty to sift the competing opinions that we have heard this week and to draw informed conclusions. 
   It is often said that the devil is in the details. To accept or reject this treaty on the basis of such flimsy understanding of the details as most of us possess is a blot on the integrity of the Senate, and a disservice to the Nation. 
   Mr. President, I refer now to the Federalist No. 75 by Alexander Hamilton. Let me quote a bit of what he says in speaking of the power of making treaties.  
   Its objects are contracts with foreign nations, which have the force of law, but derive it from the obligations of good faith. They are not rules prescribed by the sovereign to the subject, but agreements between sovereign and sovereign. The power in question seems therefore to form a distinct department, and to belong properly neither to the legislative nor to the executive..... . 
   However proper or safe it may be in government where the executive magistrate is an hereditary monarch, to commit to him the entire power of making treaties, it would be utterly unsafe and improper to entrust that power to an elective magistrate of four years duration....... The history of human conduct does not warrant that exalted opinion of human virtue which would make it wise in a nation to commit interests of so delicate and momentous a kind as those which concern its intercourse with the rest of the world to the sole disposal of a magistrate, created and circumstanced, as would be a president of the United States. 
   ..... It must indeed be clear to a demonstration, that the joint possession of the power in question by the president and senate would afford a greater prospect of security, than the separate possession of it by either of them.  
   In The Federalist Essays, Number 75, Alexander Hamilton lays out a compelling case for the fundamental and essential role that the Senate must play in the ratification of a treaty. 
   Mr. President, in accordance with what Hamilton said, in these words that I just spoke, we should pause to take his words to heart. He leaves no room for quibble, no margin for question. The Senate is a vital part of the treaty-making equation. And yet, on this treaty, under this consent agreement, the Senate has effectively abdicated its duty. 
   This is an extraordinary moment. The Senate is standing on the edge of a precipice, approaching a vote that is, by all accounts, going to result in the rejection of a nuclear arms control treaty. All of us are by now aware of a coup d'etat which has occurred in one of the more unstable nuclear powers in the world--Pakistan--a state that conducted underground tests of nuclear weapons just last year, but which in recent weeks, sent signals that it would sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   While the two events are not necessarily related, the Senate's rejection of this treaty, coming on the heel of this coup d'etat, could send a powerful message to the as-yet-unfamiliar government in Pakistan. Would it not be prudent to assess this new situation, with all of its potential ramifications to our own security situation, before we act on this treaty? I believe all of us know that it would. 
   But, Mr. President, I fear that what is driving the Senate at this moment instead of prudence or the security interests of the United States, is political agenda. Indeed, it is political agenda that has brought us to this uncomfortable place, and it is political agenda which blocks our exit from it, despite the desire of most members to pull back. 
   Once we have disposed of this vote, if the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is returned to the Senate at some future date, I urge the leaders to work together to re-examine it in a bipartisan fashion. We have a number of ready made vehicles to do so--the Foreign Relations Committee, the Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the National Security Working Group, of which both leaders are members. Our leaders should sit down with the experts whose opinions represent both sides of the Treaty debate. They should talk to the Russians, eyeball to eyeball. They should talk to our allies, eyeball to eyeball. An opinion piece in the New York Times is no substitute for face-to-face talks with the leaders of Britain, France and Germany. We have made the effort on other treaties, and we should do no less for this Treaty. 
   And above all, we should undertake this examination of the treaty on a bipartisan basis. No treaty of this importance is going to receive the consideration that it deserves without the cooperation of the leaders of both parties. It is just that simple. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to the day when we can deliberate the full implications of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. What we do on this treaty will affect national--and international--security for generations to come. We owe it to the Senate and to the Nation to give this Treaty thorough and informed scrutiny, to improve it if needed, to approve it if warranted, or to reject it if necessary. That is our charge under the Constitution, and that is the course of action that I hope we will be given another opportunity to pursue. 
   In closing, Mr. President, I cannot vote today either to approve or to reject the ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I will do something that I have never before done in my 41 years in the United States Senate. I will vote ``Present.'' I will do so in the hope that this treaty will sometime be returned for consideration, under a different set of circumstances, in which we can fully and dispassionately explore the ramifications of the treaty and any amendments, conditions, or reservations in regard to it. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. I thank Senator BIDEN. He is certainly one of the most knowledgeable of all Senators on this particular subject. I appreciate the fact that he has sat in on the hearings that the Armed Services Committee has held in the past 2 to 3 days. 
   Mr. President, the debate on which we embark today is of far-reaching consequence. We are deliberating a major treaty, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Unfortunately, we embark on this debate effectively shackled, gagged, and, to a considerable extent, blindfolded. 
   I have had the privilege of hearing three days of extremely detailed and complex testimony on this Treaty--three days! And I am one of a select few Senators, members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, together with Senator BIDEN, ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, who were exposed to that information. In a similar vein, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee conducted one full scale hearing on the Treaty this week. But the fact remains that many, if not most, of my colleagues have had little opportunity to hear from the experts testimony on the pros and cons of this Treaty. 
   To be sure, there are a number of Senators who are well versed in the details of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, but they are few in number. Senator LEVIN is one of those. Senator WARNER is one of those Senators. The rest of us are flying virtually blind. I wonder how many Senators have taken the time to read the Treaty? I wonder how many Senators have consulted with foreign leaders, those who will have to join the United States in ratifying this Treaty if it is to go into force, to get their opinions of the Treaty? 
   Mr. President, when I was majority leader, I visited other capitals and took Senators with me to talk with the leaders in foreign capitals about a treaty. 
   The Washington Post reported this morning that envoys from nearly 100 nations have implored the United States not to reject the CTBT. I wonder how many Senators fully understand the concerns of those nations? I wonder how many Senators fully understand our concerns? 
   Those who have read the text of the Treaty may be familiar with the broad brush strokes of the Treaty. But for even those Senators, the details--the implications of the Articles, the Annexes, and the Protocols to the Treaty--may be murky at best. 
   Mr. President, the hearings that the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator WARNER and Senator LEVIN, organized this week were extremely informative. So informative that I am overwhelmed by the amount of detail that I have heard. 
   I have often said that the Senator from Michigan, Mr. LEVIN, is a Senator who is exact. He scrupulously and agonizingly, it seems, peers through a microscope at every bit of minutia when it comes to details. That is the kind of study we need to give a treaty of this nature. 
   The President may sign a bill into law today. If, per chance, both Houses suddenly realized that that bill had to be repealed, we can do it. We could pass a repealer in one day in both Houses. We could do it, if the emergency existed. But not a treaty; it isn't that way with a treaty. We cannot approve the resolution of ratification today, send it to the President, the President cannot enter into the treaty formally tomorrow, and then on the second day or third day of next week, we adopt a new treaty or we take action to negate the treaty we have entered into. So a treaty is much different from a bill. 
   From Secretary William Cohen and General Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, I heard that this treaty is in the national security interests of the United States. I respect their judgments. But from former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger, whom I also respect, and whose judgment I also respect, I heard that the treaty is flawed in terms of its duration--a permanent ban on nuclear weapons testing--and in its premise that only testing that can meet a so-called zero yield threshold is acceptable. I do respect Dr. Schlesinger's judgment. I heard confidence in the Stockpile Security Program expressed by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, and I heard some caution expressed by the directors of the Energy Department's nuclear laboratories. Some caution there. Some caution. In short, I have heard some complex and conflicting testimony in a short period of time. 
   I must ask, why on earth is the United States Senate allowing a treaty of this magnitude and complexity to be rammed through the body with a maximum of 14 hours of debate, and with a limit of two leadership amendments? Have we totally lost all sense of responsibility? What would be wrong with having the vote next year after we have seen the new assessment, which we were told is on its way and will be completed somewhere around the first of the year, as I remember. What would be wrong? Or even, as some would prefer, what would be wrong with putting it off until the following year? Why do we have to do it now? Why do we have to do it next week? I am not one of those who have been saying we have to have a vote on the treaty. I don't cast any aspersions on anybody by that statement. But lest there be some here who think I am one of those who have been clamoring for a vote, I am not; and lest there be some who think that I have been prevailed upon by the administration to express opposition to our voting next week. I have not been contacted by the administration. 
   I am concerned about my country. I have heard various Senators say, well,  if I am wrong, this will happen, or if he is wrong, that will happen; or which would you want to bet on, or some such. I am not interested in who is right or who is wrong, for the sake of this Senator or that Senator. I am interested 
   from the standpoint of my country if we make the wrong decision. It is my country. And then, being one who is dedicated to this institution, having served in it for 41 years, I am also concerned that this institution is not doing its duty in connection with the approval of the ratification of a treaty. I said something to the effect that we are talking about the separation of powers here. And we are, because the constitutional framers did not feel it wise to leave in the hands of a chief executive alone the making and the carrying into effect of a treaty. And so the framers formulated this great system that we have of the separation of powers. 
   Hence, the approval of the ratification of treaties by the U.S. Senate is a facet of the separation of powers, in the great scheme of things. Now, are we, as Members of the Senate--we who have taken an oath to support and defend that Constitution of the United States--are we, who are the trusted legatees of those framers who met in Philadelphia in 1787, to put aside our portion, our responsibility in that system of separation of powers and say, oh, well, the President is right, the administration is right, give it to them, and wash our hands of it, let's not spend anymore time on it? I don't think it is my proper responsibility to say I am ready to vote on it just because an administration--whether it be my party or somebody else's party--says I should vote on it. 
   We Senators have a responsibility under our separation of powers to do our share of the work. The Senate is supposed to have that responsibility by virtue of the Constitution. I say that we are shirking our duty if we fail to uphold our end of the separation of powers doctrine, if we don't take the time to know what we are doing here. There have been questions raised. 
   Are we seriously going to cede, without a murmur, our duty to advise and consent to the ratification of treaties? Are we seriously going to allow this travesty of the separation of powers to occur? It would be nobody's fault but ours if we do. I am not saying reject the treaty nor am I saying we should approve it. I have to hold my hand up before my Creator and say I don't honestly know how I shall vote on this treaty. I will not be pressured by anybody. And politics has nothing to do with it, in my view; in this instance, certainly. 
   Mr. President, I bring before the Senate two issues that were raised by Dr. Schlesinger that I believe merit consideration. The first is the duration of the treaty. It imposes a permanent ban on the testing of nuclear weapons. Now, we are all for nonproliferation. That is not the argument here. We are all for nonproliferation, but there are other things involved here. 
   First is the duration of the treaty. It imposes a permanent ban on the testing of nuclear weapons. Frankly, I would be delighted to see a permanent ban on the testing of nuclear weapons--if we could be sure that the United States could maintain the reliability of its nuclear weapons stockpile without testing. But what I have heard this week from some people is that the Stockpile Stewardship Program is not far enough along in development to be absolutely certain, or even almost certain, that it will be an effective substitute for testing. 
   Our weapons are aging, and the nuclear scientists who developed and tested those weapons are aging also. For every year that the weapon ages, the scientist who tested that weapon ages a year. We can replace components of the weapons, but as Dr. Schlesinger and Dr. Paul Robinson, Director of Sandia National Laboratories, pointed out in their testimony, it is not so easy to replace the knowledge, the skill, and the judgment of the scientists who built those weapons. Can we really replace seasoned physicists with computer scientists? That is a question that I have, and an answer that I do not yet have. 
   Dr. Schlesinger also questions the advisability of the zero-yield threshold for nuclear weapons testing. Now, I am fairly certain that most American families will not be discussing over the dinner table this evening the relative merits of zero-yield versus low-yield testing. I doubt that many of my colleagues in the Senate will be discussing such matters over this Columbus Day holiday. But it is a vital issue in the deliberation of this treaty. I don't know enough about it, and I have read, I have listened, and I have researched, to a limited degree, the issue. 
   I still have questions. I have doubts. It may be that my doubts are unfounded. It may be that my questions can be satisfactorily answered. But not in the time constraints and under the procedural constraints with which we are faced. 
   Mr. President, the Senate has a solemn duty to offer its advice and consent in the matter of treaties. 
   We are not only not offering our advice, but we may be offering the wrong consent if we vote next week. We may be going the wrong way. We may be ill advised in the consent that we give. 
   Not just consent, as I say, but advice as well. Advice comes in the form of understandings, reservations, amendments, conditions, and the like. But not on this treaty under these circumstances. On this treaty under these circumstances, amendments, understandings, reservations, motions, or any other binding expression of opinion are out of bounds. They are off limits, save for one amendment each to be offered by the two leaders of the Senate. On a treaty binding the United States of America to a permanent ban on the testing of the very weapons that form the core of our national security; on a treaty of such incredible importance, the Senate is proceeding to a vote under a self-imposed--a self-imposed--gag order. 
   Has this body lost all sense of proportion? Has the Senate become so absolutely blind to its constitutional duties and so dedicated to its partisan political objectives that it is willing to abdicate to the executive branch the Senate's responsibility to give both its advice and consent on the ratification of treaties? Is the Senate truly willing to limit its role in the consideration of treaties to that of either rubber-stamping whatever the executive branch chooses to send us, or, alternatively, jettisoning it out of hand? That is no way to deliberate on a treaty, particularly one such as the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which holds such promise, and likewise, perhaps, such peril for the future of America's national security. 
   I respect the passion with which many of my colleagues view this treaty. They can state with absolute certitude that it is in the best interests of this country to approve the ratification of this treaty. And I respect that view. If I thought like they do, I would also express with absolute certitude that I was confident in the treaty. But they have spent more time--far more time--than I have spent on it. And I admire them for that and compliment them for it. Conversely, others with equal certitude say that the treaty should be rejected. 
   I compliment Senator LEVIN, I compliment Senator WARNER, and others on the leadership they have demonstrated. I compliment my great friend from New York, the Senior Senator from New York, before whom I bow with great reverence. But think of the experience the Senator from New York has had in the field of foreign affairs. I don't know what his position on the treaty is. But I daresay that he, too, would say we need more time. 
   What is the driving force that says we absolutely cannot wait for a few more months, or even another year? I am not bound on having a vote next year. But this treaty is permanent. This is for keeps. 
   I respect the strongly held views of others. I wish I could share their certainty either in the merits or dangers of this treaty. If we wait 6 months, I might still be uncertain. But I would have had my chance. I would have had my day in court. The Senate would have fulfilled its duty under the Constitution. To me that is important. 
   I have spent 41 years of my 82 years right here in this Senate, and I have respected its rulings, its precedents, its rules, its history, and its customs. And I have to say to Senators that I often bow my head in sorrow at the way this Senate has changed since I came here. 
   I cannot imagine that Senator Russell, Senator Dirksen, Senator Fulbright, Senator McClellan--I cannot imagine that those Senators would  have been happy, would have been satisfied. They would have been restless. They would have been very uncomfortable with saying that we have to go through with this unanimous consent request which was sent around on the telephone to all Senators' offices--on a Friday--I believe it was Friday. All Senators are busy. It is all right with an ordinary bill, an ordinary matter, that comes before the Senate. But when it comes to a major treaty, everybody recognizes a major treaty. 
   That is not a simple treaty with one or two other nations--which can be very important, however. But this is a major treaty, a far-reaching treaty. It involves the security interests of our country. It involves our children, and our grandchildren. 
   Why shouldn't we take a little more time to be sure that Senators know that this is what we are about to do? We are about to take from every Senator his normal right to offer a 
   reservation or an understanding or an amendment on a major treaty. But, as Shakespeare says, ``What's done 'tis done.'' Yet can we not rectify this horrible mistake and give this Senate a few more months so that we can have some hearings, so that we can have more experts, so that we can take time to read the treaty and to understand it and to talk with foreign leaders? I cannot understand why we have thrown away our rights so cavalierly. 
   Mr. President, I come not to bury Caesar nor do I come here to call Lazarus from the tomb. I do not come here today to make a case for or against this treaty. I am here only to plead that we have more time so we can study it and be better prepared to render a proper and right judgment. That is why I am here on this floor today. 
   I joined with other Senators in a letter some time ago urging the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee to hold hearings. That is the extent of the efforts that I have put forth in either direction. 
   I want to state for the Record, I am only here to urge that this Constitution requires this Senate to advise and consent to treaties that have been made by the President of the United States. That is all I am urging--and that we be given sufficient additional the time. We are moving toward what appears to be a sure rejection of the treaty next week for all the wrong reasons. 
   It may be that this treaty is not in the best interests of the United States. It may be that it is in the best interests of the United States. Only one thing is sure: It is not in the best interests of the United States or the Senate to be driven by little more than political gamesmanship--and all sides, I suppose, to some extent, have been tarnished by that. 
   This is not necessarily leveling an arrow from my bow toward any particular side--political gamesmanship, I say, to an all-or-nothing vote on the treaty next week with 3 days' worth of hearings, less than 2 full days' worth of debate, and virtually no opportunity to improve or to modify the Resolution of Ratification. 
   I close by urging the Senate to put off what promises to be a fatal vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and proceed, instead, with educating the Senate and the American people, so we can deliberate and decide the fate of this treaty and, who knows, this country and perhaps the world, with a better understanding of the consequences of our action. 
   I thank all Senators for their indulgence.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, over the years, the culture of college has gradually changed from one of academics and concentrated study to one consumed with partying. Gathering at the library with classmates to prepare for an exam has taken a back seat to sitting around swilling beers at keg parties or ordering a round of shots at the closest bar. 
   Sadly, the process does not always begin in college. Often times, experimentation with alcohol begins in high school, or even earlier. Large numbers of young people are drinking. According to the 1998 Monitoring the Future Study conducted by the University of Michigan, approximately thirty-three percent of high school seniors, twenty-one percent of tenth graders, and eight percent of eighth graders reported being drunk at least once in a given month. Yes, Mr. President, drunk. 
   With such startling statistics at the pre-college level, it has become increasingly important for institutions of higher education to take an even more active role in informing and educating highly impressionable, yet extremely vulnerable, college freshmen about the many dangers of this practice. Last year, I added a provision to the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998 to establish a National Recognition Awards program to identify a select number of colleges and universities with innovative and effective alcohol and drug prevention programs in place on campus. Under the program, each award recipient receives a grant ranging from $40,000 to $75,000 to assist in the continuation of its important efforts. I am pleased that I was able to obtain $850,000 in the Senate's Fiscal Year 2000 Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill to continue funding for this important initiative.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I call attention to something that I have not seen in the Senate, now, in over 5 years. It has been 5 years since I saw a Democrat in that chair. But who better than the distinguished senior Senator from New York, PAT MOYNIHAN, to grace that chair. This is truly a record day. We will be celebrating Columbus Day on next Tuesday, but I am ready to start now because there sits Senator MOYNIHAN--in the chair. 
   Let me comment just a little further on that. Imagine our good Republican friends allowing a Democrat to sit in the Presiding Officer's chair. They trust him. I think it was with great grace that JESSE HELMS, the senior Senator from North Carolina, the State in which I was born and the State whose motto is ``to be rather than to seem,'' that he chose PAT MOYNIHAN to preside over these last few minutes.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, many Americans are preparing to enjoy a three-day weekend. Most could tell you that their holiday was to honor Christopher Columbus, and a fair number might be able to recite ``in fourteen-hundred and ninety-two, Columbus sailed the ocean blue'' on his way to discovering America. An even smaller number might be able to recount the ongoing controversy over just where along the continent Columbus first came to land. But few, I hazard to guess, can truly appreciate the magnitude of his great daring, though we all appreciate the bounty of his great mistake. Few may even realize that it is next Tuesday, October 12, that is the true anniversary of Christopher Columbus' discovery of the New World, some 507 years ago. 
   Oh, Columbus, that scion of Eratosthenes, that son of Ptolemy, that kin in spirit to Marco Polo, what fascinating history he built upon when first he set out on his great journey. Although he was surely a brave man, Columbus did not sail blindly off to the west not knowing whether he would drop off the edge, as some children's books might lead one to believe. No, Columbus had the wisdom of the ancients to guide him and the lure of another adventurer's tales to entice him. He had history, mathematics, and science as his guides and greed as his goad to whip him along his journey. 
   Long before Columbus' day, Eratosthenes, the ancient Greek scholar commonly called the Father of Geography, had determined with amazing accuracy the circumference of the earth. Born around 276 B.C. at a Greek colony in Cyrene, Libya, Eratosthenes was educated at the academies in Athens and was appointed to run the Great Library at Alexandria, in what is now Egypt, in 240 B.C. During his time there, he wrote a comprehensive volume about the world, called ``Geography,'' the first known coining of that word. Eratosthenes used known distances and geometry on a grand scale to calculate the circumference of the earth to within 100 miles of its true girth at the equator, 24,901 miles. His work was still available in Columbus' time. 
   A later Greek geographer, Posidonius, felt that Eratosthenes' circumference was too large and recalculated the figure at 18,000 miles, some 7,000 miles too short. What is interesting about this fact is that Christopher Columbus deliberately used Posidonius's shorter figure to convince his backers that he could quickly reach Asia by sailing west from Europe. It may not have been the first time that financial backers have been duped using doctored numbers, but I am confident that it has not been the last! 
   So, we know that Columbus knew the earth was round--no fear of falling off the edge--and that it was between 18,000 or 25,000 miles around at its midpoint--still a very long journey in either case for ships the size that Columbus sailed on. But what led him to think sailing west from Europe to Asia was feasible? For that, Columbus would have looked to a Roman scholar, Claudius Ptolemaeus, more commonly known as Ptolemy. Like Eratosthenes before him, Ptolemy, who lived from approximately 90 to 170 A.D., worked in the Great Library at Alexandria, from 127 to 150 A.D. Perhaps inspired by Eratosthenes' work, Ptolemy also published a scholarly work called ``Geography,'' in addition to a volume on astronomy and geometry, and a work on astrology. Ptolemy's ``Geography'' consisted of eight volumes, and it introduced critical elements of map-making to the world. Ptolemy advanced the efforts of mapmakers in representing the spherical world on flat paper, in what are known as map projections. He is responsible for the now universal practice of placing north at the top of the map. Ptolemy also invented latitude and longitude--that is, he created a grid system to lay over the globe in order to chart locations. His volumes charted some eight thousand places around the world he knew, revealing for future generations a geographic knowledge of the Roman empire of the second century. 
   Like many ancient works, Ptolemy's ``Geography'' was lost for over a thousand years after it was first published. But in the early fifteenth century, his work was rediscovered, translated into Latin, and published in multiple editions. It would have been readily 
    available to Christopher Columbus, who was influenced both by Ptolemy's erroneous shorter circumference of the earth and by his depiction of the Indian Ocean as a large inland sea, bordered on the south by beguiling Terra Incognita, the unknown land. I think there can be few things more mysterious, more alluring, than an old map with large blank land masses labeled simply ``terra incognita'' or, on some medieval maps, by the phrase ``here be dragons.'' 
   Marco Polo's fantastic tales of Cathay and the exotic spices and goods that he brought back to Italy sparked a huge appetite for such things, which only increased when the returning Crusaders opened the overland trade routes between Europe and the Orient. However, when Constantinople fell to the Turks in 1453, two years after Columbus was born, the overland spice routes between Europe and Asia were closed off. Every power in Europe was eager--eager--to reopen the very profitable trade, by land or by some unknown sea route. Seeking an eastern sea route, Bartholomeu Dias reached the Cape of Good Hope in Africa in 1488, and Vasco da Gama reached India in 1498, but the eastern voyages were long and perilous. Anyone who could find a shorter route would make a fortune for himself and his backers. 
   Columbus himself was born in Genoa in 1451 to Susanna Fontanarossa and Domenico Colombo, the eldest of their five children. Growing up in a major port city, Columbus would have learned a lot about the sea, in addition to hearing and reading the tales of riches beyond the horizon. 
   True to his adventurous inclinations, Christopher Columbus took to the sea. After an attack by the French at sea in the Strait of Gibraltar in 1476, the ship Columbus was sailing on was sunk, forcing him to swim to land. He was able to grab an oar and swim to land in Portugal. Three years later, he married into the Portuguese aristocracy when he wed Felipa Perestrelo. The marriage resulted in one son, Diego, and an entr&#233; into the financial backing of the Portuguese and Spanish nobility. In the simple history of Christopher Columbus that we may recall from elementary school, which was a long time ago for me, it was King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain who finally provided the ships, the fabled Nin 6a, Pinta, and Santa Maria, in which Columbus set off on August 3, 1492, to discover the western shortcut to the fabled wealth of the Indies. At roughly 2 a.m. on October 12, 1492, after 71 grueling days at sea trusting in God, Eratosthenes, Ptolemy, and Polo, Columbus made landfall in what he believed was the Indies. 
   Columbus found no gold, silks, spices or valuable wood in his misnamed Indies, but he did bring tobacco back to Europe. After establishing a fort called Natividad, built of timbers from the wrecked Santa Maria, Columbus returned to Spain. 
   Columbus made three other journeys to his new-found land, which he named Hispaniola. His second voyage left Spain in September 1493 and returned to Spain in 1496 after establishing a more substantial colony. His third voyage led to his return to Spain in  chains, prisoner of the colonists who rose up against his bad management. Columbus was able to clear his name and made a fourth and final voyage to the New World before he died in Spain on May 20, 1506. The great irony, however, is that Christopher Columbus believing that he had discovered some untouched part of the Indies, or distant outpost of China, not a continent previously unknown to the Europeans. He had made a mistake, but what a glorious mistake it was! For us, it was a very fortunate mistake. Christopher Columbus had discovered what for Europeans was truly Terra Incognita, a new and unknown land, a treasury of natural riches that we, as his heirs, enjoy to this day. 
   I am glad that we celebrate this brave man. We celebrate a man who made a great gamble, a man who set off to seek a back door to the Far East by setting his sights west and trusting in ancient scholars. We celebrate a man who appreciated the romance of a traveler's tales and who sensed the riches and wonders that await the bold. We celebrate an imperfect man, a man who failed in his goal but who achieved much nonetheless. We celebrate a man whose daring, whose courage, who sheer persistence, moved history forward. 
   We talk about profiles in courage. These are profiles in political courage. Here was an intrepid man who perhaps could claim the greatest--or one of the greatest--profiles ever written on the record of humankind. Imagine him out there on the deep waters. He had no wireless telegraph; he had no radio; he had no weather forecasters. All he had was the compass. There were no ships in the area to rescue him if his ship sank. There was no way to hear back from home or to speak to those back home if he became ill. There was no helicopter to take him to the nearby hospital or to a sister ship. There he was, alone on the great blue waters. 
   Just imagine what courage he must have had, never knowing whether he would be able to return against the winds that were blowing from the east, no refrigerator in which to keep the hard tack. His son, Ferdinand, who accompanied him on his fourth journey, I believe it was, wrote that he, Ferdinand, had seen the sailors wait until after dark before they ate the hard tack so it would not be possible to see the maggots on the hard tack. No sanitation with respect to the water and the food was cooked in an open stove with wood on the decks of the small ship. 
   What intrepidity. But how fortunate we are today that there was a man who was so intrepid as to face down the mutinous crew and who persisted in his faith to say an oath. 
   Today we look forward to that weekend and to next Tuesday, which is actually the day, 507 years later, when Columbus made the great discovery. We will celebrate the life and the accomplishments of Christopher Columbus, the first European to see the low green land on the horizon that was North America. 
   I would like to close with the words of Joaquin Miller: 
 Behind him lay the gray Azores, Behind the gates of Hercules! Before him not the ghost of shores, Before him only shoreless seas. The good mate said: ``Now must we pray, For lo! The very stars are gone. Brave Adm'rl, speak; what shall I say?'' ``Why, say: `Sail on! sail on! and on!' '' 
 ``My men grow mutinous day by day; My men grow ghastly wan and weak.'' The stout mate thought of home; a spray Of salt wave washed his swarthy cheek. ``What shall I say, brave Admiral, say, If we sight naught but seas at dawn?'' ``Why you shall say at break of day, Sail on! sail on! sail on! and on!' '' 
 They sailed and sailed, as winds might blow, Until at last the blanched mate said: ``Why, now not even God would know Should I and all my men fall dead. These very winds forget their way. For God from these dread seas is gone. Now speak, brave Admiral; speak and say.'' He said: ``Sail on! sail on! and on!'' 
 They sailed. They sailed. Then spake the mate: ``This mad sea shows his teeth tonight. He curls his lip, he lies in wait, With lifted teeth, as if to bite! Brave Adm'rl, say but one good word: What shall we do when hope is gone?'' The words leapt like a leaping sword: ``Sail on! sail on! sail on! and on!'' 
 Then pale and worn, he kept his deck, And peered through darkness. Ah, that night Of all dark nights! And then a speck-- A light! a light! a light! a light! It grew, a starlet flag unfurled. It grew to be Time's burst of dawn. He gained a world; he gave that world It's grandest lesson: ``On! sail on!''

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate tomorrow is scheduled to begin debate on one of the most important and solemn matters that can come before this body--a resolution of ratification of a Treaty of the United States. The Treaty scheduled to come before us on Friday is the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, commonly referred to as the CTBT. 
   Consideration of a Treaty of this stature is not--and it should never be--business as usual. A Treaty is the supreme law of this land along with the Constitution and the Laws that are made by Congress pursuant to that Constitution. Article VI of the Constitution so states: ``This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution of Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.'' 
   Mr. President, consideration of a Treaty is not business as usual. 
   And yet, Mr. President, I regret to say that the Senate is prepared to begin consideration of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty under a common, garden-variety, unanimous consent agreement, the type of agreement that the Senate has come to rely upon to churn through the nuts-and-bolts legislation with which we must routinely deal, as well as to thread a course through the more contentious political minefields with which we are frequently confronted. 
   In fact, unanimous consent agreements have become so ubiquitous that silence from a Senator's office is often automatically assumed to be acquiescence. So it was the case when this unanimous consent request came to my office. I was not in the office at the time. We are very busy doing other things, working on appropriations bills, and so on. And so at the point when this unanimous consent agreement proposal reached my office, I was out of the office. When I came back to the office a little while later, the request was brought to my attention. But by the time it was brought to my attention, it was too late. I notified the Democratic Cloakroom that I would object to the unanimous consent agreement, but I was informed that the agreement had already been entered into. 
   I make this point not to criticize the well-intentioned objective of this unanimous consent agreement, which was to seek consensus on the handling of a controversial matter. I do not criticize the two leaders who devised the agreement. I criticize no one. I do, however, point out the unfortunate repercussions of the agreement as it affects the Senate's ability to consider the ratification of a treaty. 
   In short, unanimous consent is a useful tool, and it is a practical tool of the Senate. I suppose I may have, during the times I was majority leader of the Senate, constructed as many or more unanimous consent agreements than perhaps anybody else; I certainly have had my share of them, but it is not an all-purpose tool. 
   The unanimous consent agreement under which the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is to be considered reads as follows, and I now read from the Executive Calendar of the Senate dated Thursday, October 7, 1999.  
   Ordered, That on Friday, October 8, 1999, at 9:30 a.m., the Senate proceed to executive session for consideration of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty; that the treaty be advanced through the various parliamentary stages, up to and including the presentation of the resolution of ratification; that it be in order for the Majority Leader and the Democratic Leader to each offer one relevant amendment; that amendments must be filed at the desk 24 hours before being called up; and that there be a time limitation of four hours equally divided on each amendment. 
   Ordered further, That there be fourteen hours of debate on the resolution of ratification equally divided between the two Leaders, or their designees; that no other amendments, reservations, conditions, declaration, statements, understandings or motions be in order. 
   Ordered further, That following the use or yielding back of time and the disposition of the amendments, the Senate proceed to vote on adoption of the resolution of ratification, as amended, if amended, all without any intervening action or debate.  
   So if one reads the agreement, it is obvious that the treaty itself will not be before the Senate for consideration. I allude to the words in the unanimous consent request, namely:  
   ..... that the treaty be advanced through the various parliamentary stages, up to and including the presentation of the resolution of ratification.   
   So the Senate will not have any opportunity to amend the treaty, itself, but it is the resolution of ratification that will be before the Senate. 
   Mr. President, the foregoing unanimous consent agreement may be expedient and there may be some who would even consider it to be a savvy way to dispose of a highly controversial and politically divisive issue in the least amount of time with the least amount of notoriety. The politics of this issue are of no interest to me. I am not interested in the politics of the issue. I have not been contacted by the administration in any way, shape, form, or manner. Nobody in the administration has talked with me about this. I am not interested in the politics of it. Not at all. There has been some politics, of course, abroad, about this agreement, but I am not a part of that. I did join in a letter to the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee urging that there be hearings, but I have not been pressing for a vote on the treaty. 
   The politics of the issue do not interest me. But the propriety of this unanimous consent agreement does. Simply put, it is the wrong thing to do on a matter as important and as weighty as an arms control treaty. 
   The Senate Armed Services Committee began a series of hearings on the CTBT just this week, and I commend the distinguished chairman of the Committee, Senator WARNER, and the distinguished ranking member, Senator CARL LEVIN, for their efforts and commitment to bring this matter before the Senate and to have hearings conducted thereon. 
   The first hearing, on Tuesday, was a highly classified and highly informative briefing by representatives of the CIA and the Department of Energy. I wish that all of my colleagues had the opportunity to hear the testimony given at that hearing, and to question the witnesses. Unfortunately, only the members of the Senate Armed Services Committee were privy to that information. I should say the distinguished ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. BIDEN, was present also. 
   The second hearing, yesterday, brought before the Committee Defense Secretary Bill Cohen; General Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Dr. James Schlesinger, the former Secretary of Defense and Energy; and General John Shalikashvili, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. Again, their testimony was very illuminating. I wonder how many of my colleagues, outside of the Armed Services Committee, and Mr. BIDEN, had the opportunity to follow that hearing--which lasted almost five hours--given the crush of other important business on the Senate floor? 
   My coilleagues simply haven't had the opportunity to do it, other than those of us on the Armed Services Committee. 
   I wonder how many of my colleagues have had an opportunity, since the vote on the CTBT was scheduled last week, to analyze, question, and digest the testimony and the opinions of the distinguished officials that the Committee heard from yesterday? I wonder, for example, how many of my colleagues heard from Secretary Cohen that a new National Intelligence Estimate that will have a major bearing on the consideration of this Treaty is due to be completed early next year? It is my judgment that the Senate should have that assessment in hand before it considers imposing a permanent ban--a permanent ban--on nuclear testing. 
   The Armed Services Committee held its third, and I believe final, hearing on the CTBT this morning. The witnesses included Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, as well as the current directors of the nuclear weapons laboratories, and a selection of arms control experts, including a former director of one of the labs. Again, it was an extraordinarily informative hearing. 
   I was there for most of it. Unfortunately, I was scheduled to go elsewhere near the close of the hearing. But it was an extraordinarily informative hearing. The laboratory directors were candid and forthcoming in their observations. They raised a number of important issues. I wonder how many of our colleagues here, outside the membership of the Armed Services Committee, heard those. 
   I have attended every hearing and every briefing available this week in order to prepare myself for tomorrow's debate. But I did not prepare myself before this agreement was entered into. When the agreement came to my office and I objected and found that I objected too late, then I bestirred myself to learn more about this treaty. I have listened to witnesses, and I have questioned witnesses. I still have many questions--more now than when I started. 
   I wonder how many of my colleagues--particularly those who have not had the same entree that members of the Senate Armed Services Committee have had to this week's hearings--have questions about this treaty. With the exception of Senator BIDEN--and, incidentally, Senator BIDEN is very knowledgeable about the treaty. He has studied it thoroughly and is very conversant with the details of the treaty. Perhaps some of the other members of the Foreign Relations Committee have done likewise. But other than that committee and the Committee on Armed Services, I daresay that few Senators have had an opportunity to engage themselves in a study of the treaty and even fewer, perhaps, have had the opportunity to hear witnesses and to question those witnesses. 
   But, with the exception of Senator BIDEN, not even the members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have had the opportunity to hear and question the witnesses who appeared before the Armed Services Committee this week. I wonder how many of my colleagues will participate in the debate tomorrow and how many will participate in the debate next Tuesday. These days are bookends around the holiday weekend when no votes are scheduled after this evening until 5:30 p.m. Tuesday at the earliest. I am confident that many Senators have important commitments in their home States that may conflict with this debate. Does anyone in this Chamber seriously believe we can give the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty the consideration it deserves in the amount of time that has been set aside to debate it? 
   Beyond the question of time, Mr. President, is an even more disturbing question: The propriety of considering a major treaty under the straitjacket of procedural constraints in which only two amendments, one by each leader, will be in order. I have questions since I have read this treaty. I have reservations. Perhaps they will be put to rest by the debate. Or, it may be, as I continue to study the treaty and listen to the debate, that I would want to offer an amendment myself. I might want to offer an understanding or a condition. 
   I might want to offer a reservation. I have done so on other treaties. It may be that some of my colleagues would wish to do likewise. We do not have that opportunity under this unanimous-consent agreement, with the exception of our two fine leaders. I know that they will go the extra mile, as they always do, to accommodate the concerns of the Members. But they, too, are in a cul-de-sac--only one way in, one way out. They are limited to one amendment each. Without exception, the other 98 Members of the Senate are effectively shut out from expressing, in any meaningful and binding way, reservations or concerns about this treaty. 
   Mr. President, that is not the way to conduct the business of weighing a resolution dealing with the supreme law of the land. We might do that on an agriculture bill. We might do it on a bill making appropriations for the Department of the Interior. But this is a treaty we are talking about. A law can be repealed a year later but not a treaty. 
   For the good of the Nation, this unanimous consent agreement ought to be abandoned, and there are ways to do it. It is a unanimous-consent agreement, I understand that, and ordinarily a unanimous-consent agreement can only be vitiated by unanimous-consent, or it can be modified by unanimous consent. But there are ways to avoid this vote. I urge my colleagues to put politics aside in this instance, at least, and to seek a consensus position on considering a comprehensive test ban treaty that upholds the dignity of the United States Senate and accords the right to United States Senators to debate and to amend. 
   One need only read Madison's notes concerning the debates 
   at the Convention to understand the importance of treaties in the minds of the framers.  We are talking here not about an appropriations bill; we are not talking about a simple authorization bill; we are talking about something that affects the checks and balances, the separation of powers that constitutes the cornerstone of our constitutional system in this Republic. This is one of those checks and balances; this involves the separation of powers. The Senate, under the Constitution, has a voice in the approval of treaties. The President makes the treaty, by and with the consent of the United States Senate. 
   I was here when we considered the Test Ban Treaty of 1963. I was on the Armed Services Committee at that time. I listened to Dr. Edward Teller, an eminent scientist who opposed that treaty. I voted against that treaty in 1963. I opposed it largely on the basis of the testimony of Dr. Edward Teller. 
   We need to listen to the scientists. We need to listen to others in order that we might make an appropriate judgment. Who knows how this will affect the security interests of the United States in the future. This is a permanent treaty. It is in perpetuity, so it is not similar to a bill. As I say, we can repeal a law. But not this treaty. This treaty is in perpetuity--permanent. Maybe that is all right, but we need more time to study and consider it. 
   We are told that the polls show the people of the Nation are overwhelmingly in favor of this treaty. I can trust the judgment of the people generally, but the people have not had the opportunity to study the fine print in this treaty. Most Senators have not. This is not a responsibility of the House of Representatives. This is the responsibility solely of the Senate under the Constitution of the United States. It is a great burden, a great responsibility, a very high duty, and we must know what we are doing. 
   I have heard dire warnings as to what a rejection of the treaty might mean. One way to have it rejected fast, I am afraid, is to go through with this vote. But then how can we make up for it if we find we have made a mistake? If we find that we are wrong, it may be too late then. We had better stop, look, and listen and understand where we are going. We need more hearings. 
   I hope we will put politics aside in this instance and seek a consensus position on considering a comprehensive test ban treaty that upholds the dignity of the United States Senate. I am an institutionalist. I have an institutional memory. I have been in this body for 41 years, and I have taken its rules seriously. I believe the framers knew what they were doing when they vested the responsibility in the Senate to approve or to reject treaties. We ought not take that responsibility lightly. The very idea of the unanimous-consent request says Senators cannot offer reservations; they cannot offer conditions; they cannot offer amendments; they cannot offer understandings. 
   Let us so act that we reflect the importance of the treaty. Reject it if you will or approve it if you will, but let's do it with our eyes open. Let's not put on blinders. Let's not bind our hands and feet and mouths and ears and minds with a unanimous-consent agreement that will not allow unfettered debate or amendments. 
   Let the Senate be the institution the framers intended it to be. 
   I have not said how I shall vote on the treaty. I want to understand more about it. But I want other Senators to have an opportunity to understand it as well. 
   Mr. President, I thank Senators for listening, and for their patience in indulging these remarks. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Gorton-Rockefeller amendment. This amendment makes important revisions to the underlying bill concerning the rules governing the allocation of slots at the nation's four slot-controlled airports--Chicago O'Hare, LaGuardia, Kennedy, and Reagan National Airports. The issues surrounding the application of the high density rule, and the perimeter rule, are both complex and delicate. They engender strong feelings on all sides. I believe that the bipartisan leadership of the aviation subcommittee, Senators GORTON and ROCKEFELLER, performed a service to the Senate by crafting a compromise that, while not satisfactory to all Senators, proposes a regime that is much improved over the one contained in the committee-reported bill. 
   Mr. President, when the Senate is in session, my wife and I reside in Northern Virginia, not far from the flight path serving Reagan National Airport. I have had misgivings about proposals to tinker with the status quo in terms of the number of flights coming into Reagan National Airport and the distances to which those flights can travel. Despite efforts to reduce the levels of aircraft noise through the advent of quieter jet engines, I can tell my colleagues that the aircraft noise along the Reagan National Airport flight path is often deafening. It can bring all family conversation to a halt. Current flight procedures for aircraft landing at Reagan National Airport from the north call on the pilots to direct their aircraft to the maximum extent possible over the Potomac River. The intent of this procedure is to minimize the noise impact on residential communities on both the Maryland and Virginia sides of the river. Notwithstanding this policy, however, too often the aircraft fail to follow that guidance. That is not necessarily the fault of the pilots. During the busiest times of the day, the requirement to stray directly over certain residential communities is necessary for safety reasons in order to maintain a minimum level of separation between the many aircraft queued up to land at Reagan National Airport. I invite my colleagues to glance up the river during twilight one day soon. There is a high probability that you will see the lights of no fewer than four aircraft, all lined up, waiting to land, one right after the other. 
   I appreciate very much the earlier statements made by the distinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator MCCAIN. The chairman pointed out that the Department of Transportation has indicated that safety will not be compromised through additional flights at Reagan National Airport. I remain concerned, however, regarding the current capabilities of the air traffic control tower at that airport. The air traffic controllers serving in that facility have been quite outspoken regarding the deficiencies they find with the aging and unreliable air traffic control equipment in the tower. Indeed, the situation has become so severe that our FAA Administrator, Ms. Jane Garvey, mandated that the equipment in that facility be replaced far sooner than was originally anticipated. Even so, the new equipment for that facility has, like so many other FAA procurements, suffered from development problems and extended delays. Just this past weekend, I know many of my colleagues noticed the Washington Post article discussing a further two-year delay in the FAA's deployment of equipment to minimize runway incursions--the very frightening circumstance through which taxiing aircraft or other vehicles unknowingly stray onto active runways. 
   Given these concerns, Mr. President, I want to commend Senators GORTON and ROCKEFELLER for negotiating a reasonable compromise on this issue. The Gorton-Rockefeller amendment will reduce by half the increased number of frequencies into Reagan National Airport than was originally sought. It will also reserve half of the additional slots for flights serving cities within the 1,250 mile perimeter. Most importantly, Mr. President, these additional slots within the perimeter will be reserved for flights to small communities, flights to communities without existing service to Reagan National Airport, and flights provided by either a new entrant airline, or an established airline that will provide new competition to the dominant carriers at Reagan National. 
   As my colleague from West Virginia, Senator ROCKEFELLER, knows well, no state has endured the ravages of airline deregulation like West Virginia. We have experienced a very severe downturn in the quality, quantity and affordability of air service in our state. Fares for flights to and from our state have grown to ludicrous levels. A refundable unrestricted round-trip ticket between Reagan National Airport and Charleston, West Virginia, now costs $722. Conversely, Mr. President, I can buy the same unrestricted round-trip ticket to Boston, which is 100 miles farther away than Charleston, and pay less than half that amount. By targeting the additional slots to be provided inside the perimeter to underserved communities, the Gorton-Rockefeller amendment has taken a small but important step toward addressing this problem. 
   At the present time, the largest airport in West Virginia does have some direct service to Reagan National. We face greater hurdles, frankly, in gaining direct access to LaGuardia Airport in New York, as well as improved service to Chicago O'Hare. The Gorton-Rockefeller amendment expands slots at those airports as well. As a member of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I intend to diligently work with Senator ROCKEFELLER, Secretary Slater and his staff, to see that West Virginia has a fair shot at the expanded flight opportunities into these slot controlled airports. 
   Again, in conclusion, I want to rise in support of the Gorton-Rockefeller amendment. It is a carefully crafted compromise that is a great improvement over the underlying committee bill, and gives appropriate attention to the needs of under-served communities.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, recent comments by a political figure have unfairly and, I think, unjustly castigated American churches and millions of American church-goers as ``..... a sham and a crutch for weak-minded people who need strength in numbers. [meaning organized religion] tells people to go out and stick their noses in other people's business.'' Now these comments are being defended as the kind of outspoken honesty that people really seek in a politician. While I am totally in favor of greater candor from politicians, particularly in these days of poll-driven and consultant-drafted mealy-mouthed pap masquerading as ``vision,'' I am emphatically not in favor of rudeness. There is far too much rude and divisive talk in this Nation these days, and it only exacerbates the kind of climate that encourages acts of violence against anyone who is different or any organization that is not mainstream--or maybe even if it is mainstream, as churches are still mainstream, at least in my part of the world. We cannot and should not let this kind of meanness be excused in the name of honesty and candor. 
   I do not question anyone's right to voice his opinion, whether I agree with it or not, but I also do not believe it is necessary to demean or belittle or denigrate anyone in the process of voicing an opinion. I am pleased to see that I am not alone in my outrage, but that many people have expressed similar feelings. I hope that we can all learn a lesson from this episode. 
   All of us ask for guidance from those we trust whenever we are faced with difficult problems. We ask our parents, or our wives, we ask our husbands, or our friends. So what is wrong with seeking the advice of someone who has  seen more troubles and received more training in counseling than ourselves--someone who has a calling, a passion, for this role? Someone such as our pastor or priest or minister? Or what is wrong with asking the One who knows and shares all of our troubles--in asking the Creator for guidance and support? What is wrong with asking ourselves, ``What would Jesus do?'' There is nothing wrong with using the spiritual guidance provided to us from God and His Son, and tested over nearly 2,000 years of human experience. It is not weak-minded. It is not sheep-like to grow up within a framework of faith and to celebrate the rituals of the church. It does not mean that one has a weakness and needs organized religion to ``strengthen oneself.'' 
   Churches across this Nation provide millions of strong people with spiritual, emotional, and physical support. People who are active in their church may literally count their blessings when disaster strikes them. Be it the sudden loss of a loved one, a fire, a flood, that person will find himself surrounded with caring friends and helping hands. Insurance may provide a sense of financial security, but no matter whose good hands your insurance may be in, an insurance company cannot hold your hand and offer a shoulder to lean on while your home is reduced to smoky ruins or washed downstream in a flood. A pastor, a priest, a minister, or friend from your church can do so, and will do so. And people in your church will offer you the clothes off of their backs, or a place to stay, or food to eat when you are hungry, or help in many other small ways that are a balm on a hurting soul. Instead of facing your loss alone, help arrives in battalions. 
   Churches have become, in many ways, the new centers of community in America. We live in ever-expanding suburbs. We spend long hours each day commuting to jobs miles from our homes. Our children ride buses to distant schools that may combine many neighborhoods or even many communities. 
   We may rarely see our neighbor, or may know the neighbor only to nod at as we back our cars out of our driveways. Air conditioning, television, and other amenities have taken the place of sitting on the front porch with a glass of lemonade. Now, if we are outside, we are likely on a deck in the back yard, hidden by a fence or a hedge from the prying eyes of our unseen neighbors. But in church on Sunday, one is encouraged to shake a neighbor's hand. One is asked to pray for neighbors who are sick or in distress. And one hears the word of God--a Name that is above all other names--and participates in the observance of the liturgy that binds all of us in a seamless lineage to the heritage of man. 
   Churches are not for the weak-minded, Mr. President. They are for the strong. They are for people who are not afraid to seek guidance, not afraid to show charity, not afraid to practice kindness. Tolerance for the beliefs of others is one of the cornerstones on which this Nation is founded, and we in public life would be well-advised to remember that. 
   Let me close these remarks, Mr. President, with a passage from George Washington's Farewell Address. Mr. President, George Washington, commander of the American forces at Valley Forge, was not a weak-minded man. George Washington, the first President of the United States--and the greatest President of all--was not a weak-minded man. Let's share what he had to say about religion. We might even class George Washington as a politician. 
   Here is what George Washington said. I suggest that all take note.  
   Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens.  
   Let me digress briefly to suggest that all politicians, whether at the State or local or national level, take note of what George Washington said.  
   The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it simply be asked, where is the security for property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which are the instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect, that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.  
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, yesterday afternoon I voted against Senator HUTCHINSON's amendment to transfer $25 million from the budget of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to increase funding for community health centers. I am not opposed to expanding the services provided by community health centers--to the contrary, I believe they are an important element in health care delivery in West Virginia. 
   However, Mr. President, the National Labor Relations Board is also important to West Virginia. During the first half of this century, labor conditions in West Virginia coal mines, and the resulting growth in unions, led to a virtual state of war, in some instances.  Having an orderly process in place to resolve these kinds of issues, such as that managed by the NLRB, helps to keep management-labor-union relations on a civilized path. 
   The National Labor Relations Board is an independent agency created by Congress to administer the National Labor Relations Act, which is the primary law governing the relationship between unions and employers in the private sector. The NLRB has two principal functions: first, to determine, through secret ballot elections, if employees want to be represented by a union in dealing with their employers; and second, to prevent and remedy unfair labor practices by either employers or unions. The NLRB investigates violations of the National Labor Relations Act, seeks voluntary remedies to violations, and adjudicates those businesses that refuse to comply with the Act. 
   Opponents of the NLRB have been eager to eliminate it in recent years, but have not had much success in doing so on the merits. Instead, they have been attacking its financing. The NLRB's budget has not kept pace with inflation over the last six years, and, even though the case load has decreased since last year, overall, staffing levels have fallen at a greater rate. The NLRB had 6,198 unfair labor practice cases pending initial investigation at the end of Fiscal Year 1998. The Hutchinson amendment, according to the NLRB, would have caused them to process six thousand fewer cases, and cut all staff training and information technology activities in Fiscal Year 2000. 
   I support community health centers. They provide a vital service to low income persons who cannot afford health insurance. However, in my opinion, it is not practical to underfund one valuable program in order to fund another. Rather, I would prefer to see the funds come from other sources less disruptive to agencies as valuable to our nations' laborers as the NLRB.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I should be in a markup of the Appropriations Committee on the Labor-HHS appropriations bill right at this moment. 
   Mr. President, as we quickly approach the end of Fiscal Year 1999, there is a portion of the American population that is not faring very well. The small family farmers of the North-Eastern and Mid-Atlantic States have been struggling to survive a fifteen-month-long drought. With all fifty-five of our counties receiving an emergency drought declaration on August 2 from the Secretary of Agriculture, farmers in West Virginia are no exception. These farmers have been waiting for a significant and timely response to their emergency, a feeling I imagine would be similar to dialing nine-one-one and getting a busy signal. 
   Yet, over the years, this Congress has responded quickly to provide the necessary resources to help the victims of national disasters, not only in this country, but around the world. From the $1 billion for the victims of Mount Saint Helens in 1980; to the $2.7 billion for the victims of Hurricane Hugo in 1989; to the nearly $3 billion for the Loma Prieta earthquake victims, also in 1989; to the more than $10 billion for Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki in 1992; to the $6.8 billion in disaster funds for victims of the Mississippi floods in the Summer of 1993; to the North Ridge earthquake victims in 1994, for which almost $12 billion was appropriated. Throughout the 1990's, emergency disaster assistance has also been provided to the victims of tornadoes, tropical storms, droughts, floods, wildfires, blizzards, and so on. 
   In 1999, emergency aid has gone to Central American and the Caribbean nations needing assistance with reconstruction after hurricane damage, to Kosovo military and humanitarian operations, and to American farmers suffering from low commodity prices. I voted for all of these. I have been willing to support emergency aid in these instances--all of them. However, I cannot understand why the drought emergency goes ignored. I cannot understand why we are not answering the emergency calls of long-suffering Northeast and Mid-Atlantic farmers. 
   The drought has devastated--devastated--the lives of thousands of family farmers in this region. I know that the word devastated is used so often that one expects it to be pure hyperbole, but West Virginia farmers work hard on land most often held in the same family for generations. They farm an average of 194 acres in the rough mountain terrain, and they earn an average of just $25,000 annually. That is $25,000 annually for 365 days of never-ending labor. Farming is an every-day, every-week, every-month, 365-day operation every year with no time off. West Virginia farmers average $68.50 a day for days that begin at dawn and run past sunset. These small family farmers are the last to ask for assistance. They are hard-working, they are self-reliant individuals. They  have a sense of pride that prevents them from requesting federal aid unless they are in a desperate situation. These farmers are now in a desperate situation, and they are asking us to respond to them in their time of need. Now is the time that we must assist them and assist them by not by burdening them with more debt--they are over their heads in debt all right, many of them, so they are not asking for more loan programs. They need help. By providing grants, we can give them help that will help them to recover from the drought. 
   For many farmers it is already too late. They are disposing of their herds. They have sold off their livestock from land that has been farmed by their family for generations. Their pastures are grazed to stubble and will need fertilizer, lime, and reseeding if they are to support cattle again in the Spring. In the meantime, cattle must still be fed, and what little hay could be cut locally has already been eaten. The West Virginia Commissioner of Agriculture informs me that of the 21,000 surviving small family farms in West Virginia--and there were 90,000 back when I was in the State legislature in 1947. There were 90,000 farmers in West Virginia. Now there are 21,000 surviving, and over half of these are at risk as a result of drought. America cannot afford to let the small family farm die. A small family farming operation is the foundation on which America is based. We cannot afford not to help drought-stricken farmers. 
   Granted, in this area the drought seems to be a thing of the past. The water restrictions to conserve water in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area have recently been lifted. Lawns have greened up again, and the drone of lawn mowers again dominates the weekend. Schools canceled classes in this area two weeks ago because hurricane Floyd threatened to deluge the city with too much rain too quickly. However, I assure you that the drought in West Virginia continues. Hurricane Floyd's rains did not scale West Virginia's mountains. The drought is so far-reaching that schoolchildren in Fayetteville, WV, had their classes canceled last week and the Fayette County Courthouse has postponed arraignments until October 1 because the city's reservoir has gone dry. The grass in West Virginia is not getting greener, as it is here in the Washington area. It is simply not growing. 
   Seventeen North-Eastern and Mid-Atlantic States have received a Secretarial drought emergency declaration this year and five more are awaiting a decision. Yet, the emergency aid package that the Agriculture Conference Committee is still negotiating includes a mere $500 million in general aid for all disasters declared by the Secretary of Agriculture throughout 1999. The Secretary of Agriculture estimates that losses due to the drought of 1999 may total $2 billion. Losses in West Virginia alone are estimated at $200 million--and we are not a big farming State, not a big farming State. Most of ours are small farms, but these are people who have been on the land for generations. These farms have been handed down through the line of several generations. 
   Mr. President, what happened to the small family farmers in ancient Rome is happening in this country. They are leaving the land, and with them will go our family values. 
   The Secretary of Agriculture estimates, as I say, that the losses due to the drought of 1999 may total $2 billion, and in West Virginia alone they are estimated at $200 million. So the emergency aid package now attached to the Agriculture appropriations bill falls short by some $1.5 billion. 
   I want colleagues to understand that although a drought is a slow-paced disaster, it nevertheless deserves much-needed attention as an emergency and merits a response much greater and faster than the one we have so far given. A drought can, and this one has, caused farmers to go out of business. 
   My farmers know that farming is inherently a risky business. It does depend on the weather. I urge this body to help with this natural disaster. American farmers merit federal assistance to ensure their future productivity, and, more importantly, to preserve a heritage that I believe essential to this nation's history, to its moral fiber and to its character. We regularly hear talk of the small family farmer. Now is the time to help small family farmers. Congress must act on this opportunity to direct emergency funds toward a real emergency with wide-reaching effects, that impacts our most treasured Americans, our farmers. The devastation of the drought will only be compounded if we do not offer assistance now. If fields are not treated now, they will not be productive come spring. Farmers normally finance this activity with profits from fall sales, or secure loans based on such sales. But this time they have nothing to sell. 
   We need to increase appropriations that will be directed to farmers suffering from the drought of 1999. I urge my fellow conferees on the Agriculture Appropriations Conference Committee and I urge the leadership in both Houses, to answer the call of the small family farmer and support increasing emergency assistance directed toward farmers suffering as a result of the drought of 1999. Do not let their 911 call for help be answered by a busy signal. Instead, let us answer the call of farmers by sending the signal that we are busy working for farmers.

   Mr. BYRD. Madam President, shortly we will be debating two resolutions regarding education funding. Though there are differences in the approaches taken in the resolutions, the bottom line is similar--namely, this Senate and this Congress need to support education, and we need to find sufficient funding to meet our obligations to America's students. We need to support our struggling schools as they attempt to provide safe, disciplined environments in which our youth can learn both the fundamentals of history, literature, mathematics, and science, as well as the emerging fields of the next century--computers, satellite communications, advanced electronics and other information technologies that are reshaping the American workplace. 
   On this bottom line, we all agree. The difficult part in this difficult appropriations cycle is, how do we get there? Our funding levels are too low to meet the administration's request, too low to meet the needs that we can all see and agree need to be met, but we are constrained by a budgetary straightjacket imposed in 1997. All year, I have advocated breaking the budgetary caps in order to meet our most pressing needs, but until that happens, the Appropriations Committee must play the cards it has been dealt. This evening, the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, will meet to mark up an appropriations bill that contains funding for education, among other things. When all is said and done, Madam President, I am very proud of the work of our Committee on Appropriations this year. I have served with many great Senators and I have served with a number of great chairmen of the Committee on Appropriations. None has handled their responsibilities any better than has our current Appropriations Committee Chairman, Senator STEVENS of Alaska. He has worked closely with me throughout his tenure as chairman of the committee in as nonpartisan a manner as anyone I have ever worked with. We have handled these very difficult matters as best we could to the benefit of all Senators and for the American people. In so doing, despite these crushing spending caps, we have been able to pass in the Senate most of the appropriations bills. The final bill, namely the Labor-HHS appropriations for FY 2000, will be marked up in subcommittee this evening and, in all  likelihood, in the full Appropriations Committee tomorrow. 
   Madam President, frankly, I see no intellectually honest way to adequately provide for education without breaking the budgetary caps. 
   I know neither side wants to suggest that the caps be broken. Each side wants the other side to be the first. I have no hesitancy to say how I feel because I am interested in education. I am interested in meeting the needs of the country and meeting the needs of the people. If it cannot be done without breaking the caps, then so be it. 
   I cannot support these two resolutions, not because I disagree with their intent, but because I cannot voice my support for increasing education funding on the one hand while in the same breath saying that the budget caps cannot be broken. Education is important. If it is important, it is worth breaking the budget caps. And it is. It is worth breaking the budget caps. Budgetary gimmicks that add months to the fiscal year or that take funds from other critical programs like heating assistance for the poor and the elderly will not hold up over time. They are very frail reeds, very weak reeds, to which to cling in the face of hurricane force winds of need. 
   Madam President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, no Senator in this body exceeds the Senator from West Virginia in his appreciation of the work that the Senator from Alaska does as chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He is an outstanding chairman. I am proud to serve with him. He always works with me in these matters concerning allocations, and I cannot find the words to adequately praise him. He is doing an excellent job. No Senator in this body, including the Senator speaking, could ever be a better chairman of that committee than Senator STEVENS. 
   I served with a lot of chairmen of that committee over the years, but it is a two-way street. It is a team effort. This Senator contends it will always be that, whether I am ranking member or whether I am the chairman. I try to give my full cooperation to Senator STEVENS. We have never had a difference on the committee, not when I was chairman--he was not the ranking member at that time, but he has done an excellent job. He has seen the need to increase the amount of moneys for veterans' health care, and upon several occasions I have talked with him about the need to increase the amount. I took the lead, inside the committee, in increasing that amount by $1.1 billion. He fully supported me. It is the chairman, in the main, who decides how much money will be allocated to the various subcommittees. But I believe it is my job as ranking member to work with him. If I have any differences, I let him know, but I have never had any differences with Senator STEVENS. 
   So I wanted to add my compliments concerning the distinguished Senator. I also want to compliment Senator BOND, again, the chairman of the VA subcommittee, for the excellent work he has done on that subcommittee. I compliment the ranking member, Senator MIKULSKI, for the work she does. When she was chairman of that subcommittee, she was one of the best subcommittee chairmen--I don't say chairperson--she was one of the best chairmen that we had of any subcommittee. 
   I did not want this day to pass without this lowly ranking member having an opportunity to say some good words about the people who are entitled to commendation. It doesn't make any difference to me whether they are Republicans or Democrats. If they are entitled to commendation, I give it to them. 
   So I applaud you, Mr. Chairman, not only for doing a good job but for being the fair and considerate Senator that you are, and also a fair and considerate chairman as well. Again, I have to say some good words about Senator BOND, Senator MIKULSKI. They could not be better. They could not be more fair. They could not be more considerate. 
   They are hamstrung, as you are, Mr. Chairman, by the fact that we do not have enough money. I am for raising the caps. I am for telling the American people the truth. We need more money. Let's raise those caps. I am not a bit backwards about saying I support raising the caps. We have to meet the people's needs. I hope we will get around to that. I think we are going to have to do that before it is over. 
   I thank Senators for their patience for listening, but I wanted to get in my two cents' worth of commendations also.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, earlier this week we have heard again the chiming of the celestial clock, the autumnal equinox sounded the arrival of fall and the harvest season. In Washington, the skies today are sapphire blue and they look like parchment marked only with wispy glyphs of aircraft contrails. The air is crisp and the air is clear, with none of the steaminess that burdened our torrid summer days. Evenings serve up the glorious gradations of vivid colors from a palette only God could paint. Night comes earlier and night is cooler. The hum of air conditioners is giving way to the weight of blankets on the bed. In the words of Humbert Wolfe:   
   Listen! The wind is rising, 
   and the air is wild with leaves. 
   We have had our summer evenings, 
   now for October eves!  
   The year is advancing, cycling into its season of greatest abundance as crops mature and are harvested--such crops as they are. I have to add that, in the light of the terrible drought that has afflicted the eastern part of the United States, from Vermont to Tennessee. But as the crops, such as they are--mature and are harvested against the coming of winter. Branches are bent over with crisp apples and succulent pears, foretelling the apple butter festivals to come. 
   Mr. President, we have great apple butter festivals in West Virginia. Go to Berkeley Springs in Morgan County, just an hour and a half's drive from here. Go to the apple butter festival there. And there are apple butter festivals in other parts of West Virginia. 
   In my backyard, the squirrels and the chipmunks are gathering, and I play a little game with those squirrels and chipmunks. My wife, Erma, always sees to it that I have a large bag of peanuts. And when I look out the window and see squirrels, I go to the door, softly unlock the door, but the squirrels, they hear. And when they hear the little noises at the door they perk up, they sit up on their haunches and they look at the door, and then they break out into a run. They run to the door--my door, my door that opens on the back porch of my house--they run to the door because they sense that there is about to be a peanut that will emerge from a tiny crack when the door is opened. And they pounce upon that peanut. 
   The chipmunk also runs for the peanut. Sometimes he wins and gets there first, but many times he doesn't get there first, and I can just sense the disappointment on his little face as he becomes very excited and runs here and there, thither and yon, looking for a peanut which the squirrel was first to get. So I throw out another peanut and the chipmunk gets that one. 
   The squirrels and chipmunks are gathering and storing acorns and peanuts and every bit of corn and birdseed that they can steal from my feeders. Erma and I average about 40 pounds of bird food a week that we put in our bird feeders. 
   The tomato plants--aha, my tomato plants, great farmer that I am--I, every year, put out a half-dozen tomato plants. This year was a terrible year for tomatoes. The tomato plants that I cultivate in my backyard are straining under their last load of ruby jewels. But the jewels have been so slow this year to become ruby-colored. They remain green. And, of course, Mr. President, you might understand the greed with which I approach those succulent fruits from the tomato plant. But they have suffered this year not only from the heat, but also from the drought, and then from the recent heavy rains. 
   I am a fortunate farmer. My little crop is grown for pleasure, in the main. I try to furnish my own table and that of any of the grandchildren who happen to come by. My little crop is grown for pleasure. My clay pots have not been cracked by this summer's record drought, nor flooded by Hurricane Floyd. Many farmers upon whose labors my winter table depends have not been so fortunate, of course. Crops and livestock throughout the Nation have been buffeted by rather exceptional weather conditions this year, and particularly in the eastern part of the United States, from Tennessee to Vermont. 
   Come November, farmers are likely to be saying prayers--and I should think they probably have already been saying prayers--prayers of relief because, indeed, there were some rains still left in the heavens. 
   In our conference committees, Senators are working to provide assistance to our family farmers, so that they might be able to recover partially, at least, from this disastrous year and return to oversee the plowing and the calving, the planting and the lambing, the pruning and the blossoming once again, rather than giving up on their most honorable and arduous careers. 
   I have no doubt that the distinguished Senator who presides over the Senate this afternoon with a degree of dignity and skill, that is so rare as a day in June, knows what I am talking about because he comes from Wyoming and there are farmers there and farms. He knows when I talk about calving, lambing, pruning, planting, and plowing, these are not strange, alien words to him. 
   I hope that we will succeed in our efforts here in the Senate and speed up this relief to our farmers. It is much needed, and it should be on its way without delay. Those people are suffering. 
   The march of the seasons also brings us nearer to the close of the year. This year, that event has a special import. We have just begun--I believe it was yesterday--on the 100-day countdown to a calendar change that has spawned many nicknames, Y2K being one of the most common in the United States. 
   The concern over computer glitches caused by the date change certainly warrants our attention and corrective action. But the hype over Y2K and its alias, the ``millennium bug,'' has spawned a misguided perception regarding the true beginning of the third millennium since the birth of our Lord. It is a small but irritating example of sloppy, careless media reporting and advertising that reject the role of informer and educator in favor of following the popular trend. This trend might be termed ``the odometer theory,'' in which the physical act of watching all the nines roll over to zeros on a car's odometer becomes a symbolic ritual unrelated to how well the car is or is not running. Watching 1999--1-9-9-9--roll over to 2-0-0-0 may be a rare event that warrants a new year's party, but it does not truly signify anything except a new year. 
   To be formal, accurate, and correct, we must not confuse, as so many are presently confusing, January 1, 2000, with the beginning of the new millennium, which it is not. January 1, 2000, does not begin the new millennium, unless we wish history to say that the second millennium contained only 999 years. 
   When the Christian calendar, observed in the United States and, indeed, in most of the world, was established in the 6th century by the Scythian monk, chronologist, and scholar Dionysius Exiguus, died A.D. 556, he began his calendar with January 1, year 1. Thus, the third millennium will begin on January 1, 2001, not 2000. Not 2-0-0-0. So forget it. The coming year of 2000 is not the beginning of the next millennium. It is only the end of the current millennium. And this coming January is not the beginning of the 21st century. The year 2000 merely closes out the 20th century. Otherwise, we lose a year somewhere along the line--a good old fiddle tune. Somewhere along the line, we are going to throw away a year. 
   This may be the new math, but according to the old math, there are 100 years in every century for it to be a complete century, and there are 1,000 years in every millennium to complete a millennium. So let's be more accurate. 
   We may party, we may think, we may say the millennium begins next year. So on December 31 of this year, when the clock strikes 12 midnight, there are those who may wish to bring out the champagne and say: Ah, this is the new millennium! 
   It is not. We may party like it is, this December, but I caution everyone against living it up as if the world were going to end or you may face a very embarrassing morning after. 
   I thank you, Mr. President, for allowing me a few minutes to set the record straight. There it is. Unless the new math says that 999 years constitute a millennium, and that 99 years constitute a century, unless that is a given, we have to wait another year before the beginning of the third millennium. 
   Let's set the record straight on that score. It may seem like a small thing, just a little thing, the cranky ranting of a cranky older fellow. The Bible says ``the little foxes that spoil the vines.'' I am talking about one of those little foxes. 
   I am confident that others share my desire for accuracy, and my suspicion that reporters and commentators and public figures who fail on a fact so readily checked may be sloppy with other facts as well. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will only speak briefly. I was in an appropriations conference meeting when Mr. BOND so graciously called up the amendment on my behalf and on his behalf and on behalf of Senator STEVENS, Senator MIKULSKI, and others. I express my appreciation to Senator BOND for doing that. I express my appreciation to Senator STEVENS for helping us in the Appropriations Committee to have increased allocations for the various subcommittees. And particularly with reference to the Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies, the Senator from Missouri, Mr. BOND, and the Senator from Maryland, Ms. MIKULSKI, have performed an extremely important job and have done it well, with the limited amount of funds that have been available to them. 
   In the committee, we recently increased the amount for veterans' health care by $1.1 billion. We did it because Mr. STEVENS and I were able to find ways to add monies for the VA-HUD subcommittee. On the floor earlier today, the Senate agreed to the amendment offered by Mr. BOND on my behalf and on his behalf and the others whose names I have already mentioned. 
   I am sure that each of us would like to do more. I have been in Congress now, this is my 47th year. I have always supported the interests of our veterans. I was a member of the Senate when we did not have a Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. The Rules Committee, on which I served, made it possible for the Senate to consider and agree to the proposal that there be a standing committee of the Senate entitled the Veterans' Affairs Committee. I was a Senator who was on the Rules Committee then and who stood up for the veterans. We received a lot of mail at that time from veterans all over the country in support of having a standing committee of the Senate designated the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. 
   So, I have been very supportive of the veterans and their families, and legislation and appropriations that affect their welfare and their well-being. 
   Now, the House has approved a figure of $1.7 billion as an increase over the amount that was in the President's budget. The Senate committee approved an increase of $1.1 billion. That left us $600 million short of where the House of Representatives stood. I think it would be very important to the veterans if the Senate were able to go to the House, in conference, with a figure that matched the higher figure the House has already agreed upon. That is one reason why Senator STEVENS, Senator BOND, Senator MIKULSKI, and I thought it was very important to increase the amount by $600 million. 
   I want to thank our veterans organizations also. Many of us can only imagine how difficult it must be for a soldier to be awakened in the depths of the night by the startling sound of shell explosions or small arms gunfire, to be on the other side of the world from where one's family and friends make their homes, to wade through muddy water up to one's shoulders, to carry 50 pounds of ammunition and supplies on one's back, not knowing if one will live to see the sunset at the end of the day. 
   Our veterans have gone into harm's way time and time again in order to preserve the freedoms that we Americans enjoy and that our friends and allies have also fought and died to protect. There are many Americans who have dared to know the horror of war in service to this country. I am not one of those. I am not a veteran. I worked in the shipyards and helped build the Victory ships and Liberty ships to convey men and supplies to our military forces overseas. So I did my part. But I did not serve in any of the military forces. 
   Unfortunately, as the veteran population begins to reach an age where they need more health care, too many American veterans are facing the stark circumstances wherein it may appear that the Nation they faithfully and honorably served is turning its back on them in time of need. We do not intend to do that. We don't intend to do that on the VA-HUD subcommittee. We don't intend to do that on the full Appropriations Committee of the Senate. 
   So we think we have responded as best we could under the budgetary restrictions that confront us. We have caps that are set in statute. We would like to do more in many areas where appropriations are concerned, but we are restricted by the budgetary caps. I have been in favor of lifting those caps, but they are not lifted as of now. 
   I think it is our duty to honor our debt to the veterans who, in the spirit of those patriots of the Revolution,  dared much, risked much, and sacrificed much that we might enjoy the blessings of freedom. 
   I also will take a moment here to say I was very supportive 
   of our veterans when I was chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I helped to appropriate funds and to allocate funds to the VA-HUD subcommittee in order that we might add clinics, add space in various veterans hospitals around the country. We did it in my own State of West Virginia, in Huntington, Beckley, Clarksburg, Martinsburg. I can remember when I helped to provide $76 million for a new veterans hospital in Martinsburg to replace the old Newton D. Baker Hospital. I have been in this fight a long time. I am not a veteran, but I think I have been true to my duties and responsibilities here, one of which duties is to see that our veterans are taken care of, treated fairly, and that their services are respected, appreciated, and remembered. 
   Therefore, I was happy today to provide the amendment that was offered by Mr. BOND and cosponsored by Mr. BOND, Mr. STEVENS, Ms. MIKULSKI, and an additional 20 or more Senators. 
   I thank the distinguished Senator from Missouri for yielding this time. 
   I have to go back to another appropriations conference. This time, I want to take up the battle for our drought-stricken areas of West Virginia and other States in the eastern United States, stretching from Tennessee up to Vermont. Again, that is with respect to the drought and the problems it has created for our livestock farmers. I want to go there and fight their battle. For the moment, I have been delighted to come to the floor. I also appreciate the support of other Senators on this amendment. I express my appreciation to Senator STEVENS, who is not on the floor, and to Senator BOND, and Senator MIKULSKI for the excellent leadership they continue to give in this extremely important bill. 
   I thank all the cosponsors to the amendment which would provide an additional $600 million for veterans' medical care, including Senators BOND, DOMENICI, STEVENS, MIKULSKI, GRASSLEY, BINGAMAN, JOHNSON, SPECTER, MURKOWSKI, WELLSTONE, SMITH of New Hampshire, HOLLINGS, ROCKEFELLER, AKAKA, CONRAD, KERREY, BIDEN, LEAHY, BOXER, HAGEL, MURRAY, JEFFORDS, SARBANES, HUTCHINSON, REID, KERRY, ROBB, BUNNING, BRYAN, KENNEDY, ROBERTS, ASHCROFT, SNOWE, COLLINS, COVERDELL, HARKIN, ABRAHAM, DORGAN, DURBIN, THURMOND, MCCAIN, LEVIN, LANDRIEU, FRIST, and others.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator FEINGOLD, for bringing us together today to celebrate the passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964. Too often, the pressing events of the day prevent us from remembering so many important pieces of legislation. I am happy that we are able to take a moment to recognize a historic piece of legislation. 
   Let me begin with a look backward over the well-traveled road of history. It is only fitting that we turn our faces backward so that we might be better informed and prepared to deal with future events. On a whole range of important issues, the Senate has always been blessed with Senators who were able to rise above political parties, and consider first and foremost the national interest. There are many worthy examples throughout the Senate's history. 
   My friend and former colleague, Senator Mike Mansfield, and other distinguished Members of the Senate understood this point well. Political polarization, a simple zero-sum strategy by one party to achieve a short-lived victory which demonizing the other party, is not now, and has never been, a good thing for the Senate. I know that Americans have always loved a good debate. I believe that this is one of the lessons that we can take from the passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964. Members on both sides of the issue focused on the more substantive and stimulating policy challenges rather than allowing pure politics and imagery to enter into the fray. 
   The debate on the Wilderness Act of 1964 serves as a great example of the Senate's charge in taking a leadership role and working over the long term to pass historic pieces of legislation. I believe the bill's chief sponsor, Senator Clinton Anderson from New Mexico, understood this point well when he said, upon consideration of the conference report, on August 20, 1964:  
   What we have done we have done not only to meet the urgency of the moment, but for the future. In no area has this Congress more decisively served the future well-being of the Nation that in passing legislation to conserve natural resources and to provide the means by which our people could enjoy them. One of the brightest stars in the constellation of conservation measures is the wilderness bill *.*.*. The path of the wilderness legislation through Congress has sometimes been as rugged as the forests and mountains embraced by the wilderness system.  
   The Senate understood there was a need to protect America's unique places, and Members worked to craft a proposal over a number of years that could achieve that end. Senator George McGovern, another key supporter of the Wilderness Act, observed:  
   I think each of us has been enriched at one time or another through our experiences with natural undisturbed areas of the country *.*.* its comparatively uncluttered open spaces, its lakes and woods, have special appreciation for the purpose of the wilderness preservation system. As the population of our country grows and as our city areas become more contested, it is all the more imperative that we look to the preservation of great primitive outdoor areas where people can go for recreational and inspirational experience.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I join with my distinguished colleague, the manager of the bill, in urging Senators to come to the floor and debate these amendments. It is my understanding, as it is his, that the distinguished Senator from Illinois, Mr. DURBIN, wishes to speak against the amendment by the distinguished Senator from Missouri, Mr. BOND, and he will certainly have that opportunity. 
   I trust the offices of Senators--I am sure they are watching and listening--will pass on to the respective Senators this urgent message that we are trying to state here, that we are here, we are here to discuss amendments, debate them, agree to them, vote them down, vote them up, amend them further, or whatever. But Senators need to come to the floor and make their wishes known so that this valuable time will not be lost. So I urge our Senators to act accordingly. 
   Now I yield the floor. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am opposed to the amendment that is being offered by the Senator from New Hampshire, my good friend Mr. SMITH. He and I serve together on the Armed Services Committee. I have great respect for him and certainly for many of his viewpoints. But on this matter, I will oppose his amendment. 
   I am a product of the Depression as well as the days and some of the years ante-Depression. When I graduated from high school in 1934, which was 65 years ago now, I was the valedictorian of the class. Of course, we only had 28 in the class. If there had been 29, I might not have been the valedictorian. But I was very fortunate in going to the Mark Twain High School and grade school in a coal mining community in southern West Virginia. 
   Mark Twain High School had a faculty that probably would have matched the faculty of a junior college in these  days. Teachers did not get paid much, but they were highly dedicated teachers. 
   The principal of the high school was a man by the name of William Jennings Bryan Cormany. And his wife, Marguerite Cormany, was an excellent music teacher. Mr. Cormany was a strict disciplinarian. He was the kind of high school principal we should have all across this country these days. We paid attention in his class. He taught physics. He was an excellent teacher. 
   His wife organized a high school orchestra and a band. She wanted me to be in the band. I was the bass drummer. The bass drum was larger than I was, but I was the bass drummer. She also talked me into taking lessons on the violin. My foster father was a coal miner, and through the sweat of his brow, he bought me a violin. I can remember the Saturday afternoon when we piled into a large flat-bed truck and went from Stotesbury to Beckley, about 15 miles away. 
   I went back home that night. I had a violin case tucked under my arm with a violin in it. My dad paid all of about $28 or $29 for this violin, violin bow, and violin case. I went home that night and had visions of becoming a Schubert or a Chopin. I could see myself being one of the great artists. Those were dreams.  
   How great it is to believe the dream 
   As we stand in youth at the starlit stream, 
   But greater still to live life through 
   And find at the end that the dream is true.  
   I dreamed of being a great musician. My natural father was a musician. He was not an educated man. He never took a music lesson in his life. I never knew him very well. I only lived with him about a week in my life. 
   He was my natural father. 
   I lost my mother when I was less than a year old. She died with the influenza in 1918. But she wanted my father, if she died with the influenza, to give me to one of his sisters who had married a Byrd. She died the next day or so after she came down with the flu. 
   My father just had a natural talent for many things. When he went out to pick the beans in the garden, he would be memorizing chapters from the Bible. He could play almost any instrument he ever put his hands on--the organ, the banjo, the guitar, the Autoharp, and so on. He had a natural talent for music. 
   I inherited some of that talent for music. I loved it. And so my coal miner dad, who was my uncle, bought this violin for me. I started taking lessons when I was in the 7th grade in school. When I graduated, of course, I was still in the orchestra and in the band. 
   By that time, I had also learned to play many of the old mountain tunes. My music teacher, Mrs. Cormany, did not take that very well. She was not very happy that I would go out behind the schoolhouse and play ``Old Joe Clark'' on my fiddle or ``Arkansas Traveler'' or ``The Mississippi Sawyer'' or ``The Chicken Reel.'' She did not approve of that. But I did it nevertheless. So, I came to learn to play ``by ear,'' as they say. 
   Well, now, my boyhood without that music would have been an empty boyhood. I started out in life where the bottom rungs in the ladder were not there. They were missing. There was not the first rung or the second rung. As I say, I grew up in the Depression, which was a hard, hard life at best. 
   But the music did something for me. It did for me what David's music did for Saul when he appeared before King Saul. Music through the ages has come from the depths of the soul of man. It has been an inspiration to him Michelangelo and the Sistine Chapel; Leonardo da Vinci and the Mona Lisa; Phidias, who was a great sculptor at the time of Pericles. Pericles lived in the latter half of the 5th century. I remember the Peloponnesian Wars lasted from 431 to about 404 BC. Phidias was a great sculptor at that time. 
   All through the ages, men have had this desire to use their talents. We read about seeing the forms of animals or persons carved into the caves of ancient mankind and on the obelisks in Egypt. We know about the cuneiform writings, the Sumerians, the Hittites, the ancient Chinese. The ancient peoples drew word pictures before they learned to write. 
   There is something about man that is above the animal. Do not tell me that man is an animal. I know they teach that in school, but they are all wrong. They are 100 percent wrong. Man is not an animal. An animal cannot draw a picture. An animal cannot paint a picture. An animal cannot play a violin. An animal cannot memorize the multiplication table. Man is not an animal. 
   God created man out of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life. There is a spark of the divinity in man. A man is a little above the beasts of the field, a little lower than the angels, but there is that spark of divinity. There is something in mankind that tends to lift his spirit in the lofty flights of song and poetry. Music is one of those talents that is ingrained in the genes of man. 
   I can certainly understand the feelings of Senators with respect to some of the recipients of funds from the National Endowment of the Arts in 
   years gone by. They were absolutely foolish, stupid to make those awards. It was colossal stupidity on the part of the Endowment to award grants to people who had such motives and objectives as a few of them had. But they were a tiny few. I think it would be a very serious mistake here to strike this from the bill. 
   Who knows, there may be a little Michelangelo, there may be a little Benjamin West. Benjamin West said that one day he took to his mother some childish drawings of birds, and his mother took him up on her knee, kissed him, and said: ``Son, you will grow up to be a great painter.'' Benjamin West said that it was a mother's kiss that led him to become a great painter. The encouragement that his mother gave him after seeing the childish drawings and paintings that he had made caused him to aspire to do greater things. 
   I can remember that my dad was very poor, the man who raised me. At Christmastime, he never gave me a cap buster or a cowboy suit. In saying this, I do not denigrate those things. But he gave me a watercolor set or a drawing tablet or a book. He did not want me to be a coal miner, as he had been. 
   So here we are today. In a sense, we can feel that in passing this legislation, as we are passing it, and providing funds--and funds are hard to come by--but we are in a sense providing a little watercolor set or a drawing tablet--we can put it down to that level--to some talented, ambitious, deserving achieving person. 
   I close with this poem, if I can recall it, which tells the story. Who knows, out of these funds there may not be just one, but there may be many masters--masters--as they develop the talents that are borne within their genes. Many people have those talents and never have the opportunity to develop them. So, where we can, I think, provide the opportunity and the encouragement, we ought to do it. That is a side of life--a side of our culture that is uplifting. We should not attempt to dampen it down, or discourage or put it beyond the reach of those who cannot otherwise afford it. 
 'Twas battered and scarred, and the auctioneer  Thought it scarcely worth his while To waste much time on the old violin,  But held it up with a smile: ``What am I bidden, good folks,'' he cried,  ``Who'll start the bidding for me?'' ``A dollar, a dollar''; then, ``Two!'' ``Only two?  Two dollars, and who'll make it three? Three dollars, once; three dollars, twice;  Going for three----'' But no, From the room, far back, a gray-haired man  Came forward and picked up the bow; Then, wiping the dust from the old violin,  And tightening the loose strings, He played a melody pure and sweet  As a caroling angel sings. 
 The music ceased, and the auctioneer,  With a voice that was quiet and low, Said: ``What am I bid for the old violin?''  And he held it up with the bow. ``A thousand dollars, and who'll make it two?  Two thousand! and who'll make it three? Three thousand, once, three thousand twice,  And going, and gone,'' said he. The people cheered, but some of them cried,  ``We do not quite understand What changed its worth.'' Swift came the reply:  ``The touch of a master's hand.'' 
 And many a man with life out of tune,  And battered and scarred with sin, Is auctioned cheap to the thoughtless crowd,  Much like the old violin. A ``mess of pottage,'' a glass of wine;  A game--and he travels on. He is ``going'' once, and ``going'' twice,  He's ``going'' and almost ``gone.'' But the Master comes, and the foolish crowd  Never can quite understand The worth of a soul and the change that's wrought   By the touch of the Master's hand.  
   Let us defeat this amendment and reject it overwhelmingly let us continue to make it possible for some future masters to lay their talented hands upon the culture of our own civilization and thereby benefit all of posterity.

   Mr. BYRD. I thank the senior Senator from Washington. Much of the  progress we have made as an industrialized society has been the result of remarkable advances in materials. Improvements in commonplace and necessary items--cars, planes, computers, medical equipment--all are intricately tied to enhancements to the materials from which they are constructed. The same is true of our energy sources and energy production. Our power plants--the turbines, boilers and pollution controls that supply the electricity that powers our economy--are only as effective and reliable as the materials we use to build them. 
    Mr. Chairman, you and the Committee have done an admirable job in fashioning a budget that points this Nation toward new technologies for generating electricity in the 21st Century. The Committee's proposal supports a new concept for power generation called ``Vision 21.'' This ``Vision 21'' initiative excites our imagination over the possibility of a pollution-free power plant. But the success of ``Vision 21''--or, for that matter, any advances in tomorrow's energy technologies--will depend on the development of stronger, more durable, and more reliable materials. 
   Your support, Mr. Chairman, has been critical in ensuring that funding for materials research and development is included in this bill. Should the Department of Energy reassess its funding needs and priorities in order to move this research effort forward, would you give consideration to a request from the Department to redirect a portion of its funding to further this effort?

In fact, a number of National Park Service sites in West Virginia have unmet operational and staffing needs. I can assure the distinguished Senator from South Carolina that if the National Park Service deems the Congress Swamp National Monument to be in need of additional staff to carry out its stated mission the Committee would give careful consideration to providing additional funds in the future to increase staffing levels at this site. It is important that visitors to all our National Park sites come away with the education and appreciation that these sites deserve.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, West Virginia State College in Institute, West Virginia, was designated by Congress as one of the original 1890 land-grant schools under the Second Morrill Act. The college was the first 1890 land-grant school to be accredited and has been accredited longer than any other public college or university in West Virginia. 
   West Virginia was one of six states to establish a new land-grant college under state control. West Virginia State College faithfully met its duties to the citizens of West Virginia as a land-grant college in an outstanding manner. 
   However, on October 23, 1956, the State Board of Education voted to surrender the land-grant status of State College (effective July 1, 1957). Historical data suggests that this action was taken in an effort to enhance State College's ability to accommodate veterans returning home with GI benefits. In addition, the decision to surrender the land-grant status preceded explicit funding by Congress for land-grant institutions. 
   For thirty-three years, West Virginia State College has sought to regain its land-grant status. On February 12, 1991, Governor Gaston Caperton signed a bill into law that provided redesignation authority for land-grant status from the State of West Virginia. On March 28, 1994, then U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy informed West Virginia Governor Caperton that State College would receive a partial land-grant designation that would entitle the college to $50,000 annually under the Second Morrill Act. 
   It has become clear that funding is the issue that must be addressed to reinstate West Virginia State College's land-grant status. I authored an amendment to the FY 2000 Agriculture Appropriations bill that will provide $2 million in additional funds for 1890 Institution entitlements to be used for base line funding for West Virginia State College. This amendment does not grant full 1890 land-grant funding privileges to State College, but provides a $2 million entitlement. The amendment does not cut into the current 1890 entitlement accounts. It adds additional funding with an offset from the National Research Initiative account. 
   My amendment provides fair treatment to West Virginia State College, an original 1890 land-grant school, and I thank my colleagues for supporting this provision.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last night, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the conference report to H.R. 1664, the bill containing the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee and Emergency Oil and Gas Guaranteed Loan programs, by a vote of 246 yeas to 176 nays. H.R. 1664 was passed by the Senate on June 18, 1999. 
   The steel and oil and gas loan guarantee programs will provide qualified U.S. steel producers and small oil and gas producers with access to a $1.5 billion GATT-legal, revolving loan guarantee fund to back loans through the private market. A board of the highest caliber--consisting of the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, who will serve as the Chair, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission--will oversee the programs. These distinguished board members will ensure careful analysis of the guarantee award process, including actions needed by U.S. steel mills and oil and gas producers to secure a financial recovery along with a reasonable prospect for repayment of the federally guaranteed loans. The loan guarantee programs are written to provide the board members with the flexibility necessary to offer the maximum benefit to U.S. steel and oil and gas businesses and the maximum protection to the taxpayers. 
   The passage of H.R. 1664 is a vital measure for both the U.S. steel industry and the oil and gas industry, and it was a personal pleasure for me to work with the fine Senator from New Mexico, Mr. DOMENICI, on this important legislation. I authored the steel loan guarantee provisions, while my good friend Senator DOMENICI authored the provisions for oil and gas. After several long nights, some tough negotiations, and countless consultations, H.R. 1664, a bill that joined our two programs, will deliver critical assistance to hard working Americans. H.R. 1664 is, indeed, a ``buy American bill.'' But, more importantly, the passage of H.R. 1664 is a vote of confidence for American workers and American families. 
   Passage of H.R. 1664 is an important statement by this Congress in support of the men and women in the U.S. steel industry. These workers have played by the global trade rules only to find themselves cheated by our trading partners who ignore the rules in order to maximize their own profits. Illegal steel trade has created exceedingly difficult finanical circumstances for the U.S. steel industry, and the U.S. steel industry deserves the benefits provided under H.R. 1664. Those benefits simply will provide essential loan guarantees to address the cash flow emergency created by the historic surge of cheap and illegal steel. They are vital to the future viability of many, many steel jobs. 
   The historic level of illegally dumped imported steel is a national crisis. The record levels of these foreign imports have caused over 10,000 thousand U.S. steelworkers to experience layoffs, short work weeks, and reduced pay. American steel companies have suffered from reduced shipments, significant drops in orders, price depression, lower profits, and worse. Already, at least six U.S. steel manufacturers have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protections, jeopardizing employees, families, and entire communities. This steel loan guarantee program can help to prevent further bankruptcies, and provide vitally important support for the survival of small- and medium-sized steel manufacturers. 
   Steel communities are proud of their role throughout this nation's history. Through the work of men and women in places like Weirton, West Virginia, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the backbone of this nation was forged. Steel has always been a driving force in the growth and prosperity of our nation. 
   I applaud the action by this Congress in passing H.R. 1664. It was the right thing to do. I urge the President to quickly sign the bill into law. These loan guarantee programs will operate through the private market to help sustain good-paying jobs, support our national security, and save taxpayers millions of dollars from lost tax revenues and increased public assistance payments.

   Mr. BYRD. Yes, the Senator from New Mexico is correct in that assumption. It will be the lender that obtains the direct benefits of a loan guarantee, and it is the prospective lender that will be required to submit necessary application materials for the guaranty. The prospective borrower will, of course, also have to submit information and other material as part of the application for a loan guarantee, but under each program it is the lender with whom the Loan Guarantee Board will have its legal relationship. Therefore, it is the prospective lender that will be required to apply for assistance under these programs.

   Mr. BYRD. The Loan Guarantee Boards would absolutely have that discretion. The clear intent of this legislation is to effectuate the guarantee of up to $1.5 billion of loans under the two programs. There is no requirement for first-come, first-served among applicants. The Boards may impose additional reasonable requirements for participation in the programs. It is, indeed, our intent to look to the judgment and expertise of the administering agencies, the experience and competence of professional advisors, and the wisdom and common sense of the Loan Guarantee Boards themselves to make these programs run effectively. It is not our intent to hamstring the Boards in determining their priorities and procedures; rather, we expect the Boards to implement these programs as to ensure the fulfillment of the Congressional purpose.

   Mr. BYRD. Yes, those are correct assumptions. While the Boards will have the ultimate decision-making responsibilities, and will take the actions directed by the legislation, as a practical matter they are not expected to handle the day-to-day work of administering loan guarantee programs. That will be handled through the Department of Commerce, using its own staff, contracting for the consultants and other services, or through agreements with another agency or agencies.

   Mr. BYRD. My good friend from New Mexico is correct. Under this legislation, the full faith and credit of the United States will, in fact, stand behind each loan guarantee executed by the Loan Guarantee Board, the same as if the legislation specifically said so. Lenders may participate in this program with confidence, and should therefore offer the borrowers the very best terms--including low interest--on the guaranteed loans.

<DOCNO>106-byrd-wv-8-19990805</DOCNO>

   Mr. BYRD. Yes, that assumption is accurate. Any rule issued to implement this program could be considered a ``major rule'' under the Congressional Review Act, and subject to the delayed effective date. However, the legislation itself recognizes the urgency of the programs: section 101(l) provides that the Steel Loan Guarantee Board ``shall issue such final procedures, rules, and regulations as may be necessary to carry out this section not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act.'' Identical language appears for the Oil and Gas Loan Guarantee Board, in section 201(k). Due to this urgency, we expect the Administration to apply the provisions of the Congressional Review Act which allow even a major rule to go into effect without delay, consistent with the public interest.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, stacks of spiral-bound notebooks and reams of paper, boxes of pencils and pens, lunch boxes and backpacks, are all making their way onto store shelves across the Nation as summer limps toward its hot, dry conclusion and the warm, crisp promise of autumn days, yellow school buses, and children walking to school closes in on us. A new school year is upon us, with all its bright potential for learning. Most students welcome the chance to see their friends again, and to again immerse themselves in the business of learning and growing. But sadly, some children are afraid to go to school. Some children must face and conquer the memories of sudden, violent death that have visited their schools in recent years. 
   Mr. President, in the wake of the senseless atrocities that have ripped at the traditional calm of schools across the country, it has become increasingly evident that we must work together here in Congress, and with our state governments, to prevent this kind of terrible tragedy from striking yet another American schoolyard. I am pleased to have recently joined with Senators LIEBERMAN and MCCAIN in authoring legislation to create a National Commission on Youth Violence, which has been included in the Senate-passed juvenile justice legislation. 
   With the new school year just around the corner, it seems an opportune time to refocus our energies on the work underway in each of our respective states, and to help the states craft even more effective prevention strategies for the upcoming academic year. And similarly, the states will serve as an invaluable resource for helping us to better strategize on federal solutions necessary for restoring peace and tranquility to our nation's schools. If we hope to have a school year free from the violence and emotional grief that rocked our nation last year, an equal exchange and dialogue is truly in order. 
   Given the most serious nature of the challenge we face, it is important that we bring together a wide range of experts to seek solutions to school violence. In this vein, I am pleased, today, to announce my cosponsorship with West Virginia University of a day-long symposium on safe schools and communities. From representatives of the West Virginia State Police, to parents, students, and the church community, the symposium participants will focus on efforts already underway throughout the state to combat school violence, and what more needs to be done to better protect our teachers and students from classroom violence. I hope that this event will give participants the opportunity to highlight the progress that has already been made in school safety, while also helping to create a guide for what still needs to be accomplished. West Virginia University, with its wealth of research and expertise, is the ideal forum for this event, and I feel confident that its contribution in behalf of the higher education community will further strengthen this ongoing dialogue throughout the state. 
   A school ought to be a place where students thrive on learning for learning's sake alone, and where teachers find true pleasure in explaining the details of the battle at Antietam or the Pythagorean theorem. It ought to be a place where students can frolic in the school playground with classmates during recess without a worry in the world. Mr. President, the events of the recent past work against this vision. 
   It is my hope that this symposium will provide West Virginians with an opportunity to look for ways to prevent such violence from occurring in West Virginia schools. By bringing together West Virginia parents, educators, students, law enforcement officials, policy makers, and a variety of other experts to examine school- and community-based strategies to reduce youth violence, we, collectively, will bring greater clarity and wisdom to this troubling issue, both at the state and federal levels. 
   As students and teachers prepare for another school year, we need to reflect on the violence that has taken place in so many other communities, and look for ways to prevent such violence from occurring in West Virginia schools. Through this symposium, it is my hope that we will take the time to find the strength to reach across the lines that serve to divide us and touch the common spirit that the Creator instilled in each of us. It is long past time for us to work together on common ground to achieve common dreams.

   Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, usually, in this town, newspaper headlines are about politics. News stories feature articles about tax cuts, health care plans, and various partisan tactics. 
   But, yesterday's headline in the Washington Post, reads ``Drought Is Worst Since Depression,'' and the story that follows warns of drought conditions that have gripped the Mid-Atlantic that are second only to the those seen during the bleak years of the Great Depression. 
   We have begun to feel the pinch of this drought, with water usage limited in certain areas. With these restrictions, many people are inconvenienced by the loss of their home landscaping investments--watching their grass, flowers, and shrubs slowly withering and turning brown.  
   But, this drought is more than an inconvenience for those employed in one of America's hardest-working, most selfless professions. That is farming. Farming is hard luck even at best. 
   I speak of the farmers throughout our region, including West Virginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Delaware, they are more than just inconvenienced. They are watching their very livelihoods slowly wither and turn to dust. 
   In West Virginia, this drought has devastated--devastated--the lives of hundreds of family farmers, and I am deeply concerned about the fate of West Virginia's last 17,000 surviving small family farms. West Virginia farmers work hard on land most often held in the same family for generations. They farm an average of 194 acres in the rough mountain terrain, and they earn an average of just $25,000 annually. That is $25,000 annually for 365 days of never-ending labor. 
   The distinguished occupant of the Chair, who hails from Wyoming, understands that farming is an every-day, every-week, every-month, 365-day operation every year with no time off. In farming there is no time off. That is $68.50 a day for days that begin at dawn and run past sunset in this scorching heat. Today, as the drought 
   lingers on, West Virginia farmers, particularly cattle farmers, find themselves in critical financial circumstances. 
   To address this crisis, I urge my colleagues to support the inclusion of a $200 million emergency relief program for cattle farmers in the Fiscal Year 2000 Agricultural Appropriations Bill which is before the Senate. My provision--if enacted--would provide Federal disaster payments to cattle farmers for losses incurred as a result of this year's heat and drought. Compensation would depend on the type and level of losses suffered, and would be available to cattle farmers in counties across the Nation which have received a Federal declaration of disaster for severe drought and heat conditions. 
   My provision provides direct assistance to farmers who have dedicated their lives to feeding this Nation, and who suffer at the will of Mother Nature with no recourse. 
   In West Virginia, my emergency drought aid for cattle farmers will literally decide the future fate of hundreds of small family farmers. The drought has sucked the life from the land, and is on the verge of draining the last resources from the pockets of the drought-stricken farmers. 
   As of yesterday, Senator ROCKEFELLER and I went to West Virginia and were there when the Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. Glickman, was there to witness some of the drought-stricken areas in the eastern panhandle. 
   On that trip to West Virginia, Gus Douglas, the West Virginia commissioner of agriculture, told of being at a market where animals were being taken for sale. 
   One farmer, who had worked his entire life breeding a herd of which he could be proud, was there with his animals. He was there to sell his cattle at this market. He was not there just with ten or twenty head of cattle. He was there with his entire herd. He knew that he did not have enough feed to make it through winter, so despite the fact that his animals would be poor prospects at auction, he had brought them all to be sold. They had already consumed the fodder that would otherwise sustain them through the coming winter months. 
   This farmer was losing twice. First, he would make no profit on the cattle he would sell. Second, he could no longer afford to keep his herd. It was time to completely liquidate the herd. As the farmer unloaded his animals at the market, there were tears in his eyes. 
   It was too late for this farmer, and if we do not act quickly to get an emergency assistance package passed, it will be too late for many, many more family farmers throughout the land. 
   During our visit to West Virginia, Secretary Glickman declared all fifty-five West Virginia counties a federally designated disaster area. West Virginia is not alone, and my provision will help, if it is accepted, if it is adopted, will help cattle farmers in Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and any 
   other region that receives a natural disaster declaration for excessive heat and drought. 
   During this visit with the Secretary, more than twenty farmers and their wives, gathered inside a barn on Mr. Terry Dunn's property in Jefferson County to share their personal stories about how the drought is impacting them and what kind of help they need. The overwhelming consensus was that programs that were designed to work at a time when our agriculture markets were strong, are not going to be enough to keep a new generation on the family farm. 
   In spite of all types of adversity, family farmers have had the ingenuity to keep their farms working for generations. Surely they can be trusted to wisely use direct federal payments, and with this same time-tested ingenuity, keep their farms running. Farmers in West Virginia have wisely diversified their crops. In ordinary years, many farmers grow enough different kinds of crops to be able to feed their animals, their families, and still take produce to market for a good portion of the summer. But, the extraordinary times of this drought require that we act now to help West Virginia's farmers and other farmers in the non ``farm states'' who are currently experiencing difficulties as the result of extreme weather conditions. 
   According to government statistics, West Virginia is experiencing some of the most severe water shortages in the nation. Crop losses in one county alone, Jefferson County, were estimated two weeks ago to be almost $8.7 million and they are above that now. In the Potomac Headwaters region of the state, conditions are much worse. Total damages in the state for crop losses are more than $100 million. This figure does not even include the value of grazing pasture lost and winter feed eaten during the summer, or losses incurred from selling livestock early, due to extreme weather conditions. 
   Almost fifty percent of West Virginia's cropland is pasture, forty-six percent is harvested, and the remaining four percent is idle. The hay and corn that usually feed the cattle herds are gone. The ponds are shallow and foul, the springs are dried up, and the wells are dry. 
   Although West Virginia farmers are willing to work day and night to keep up with the backbreaking work of farming, no amount of work will restock the dwindling stores of grain that are now being used to keep animals alive at the height of the summer growing season, when pastureland should be more than enough to satiate an animal's hunger. No amount of sweat can restore vigor to stunted crops that have gone too long without a soaking downpour of rain reaching the deepest roots. There is little that these farmers can do to fill their wells or farm ponds with water. 
   I traveled to see the damage that the drought in West Virginia is causing for farmers. 
   I heard for myself the stories they told. I saw for myself the impact this drought is having, and I saw on those tired, drawn faces the impact this drought is having on the bodies, the minds, and the souls of men and women who earn their bread by the sweat of their brow, in accordance with the edict that was issued by the Creator Himself when He drove Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. 
   We visited a corn field on Terry Dunn's farm. The reddish soil was dust at my feet. The corn stalks that should have grown beyond my head by this time of the season were barely knee high. 
   I wanted to see what kind of ears these stunted stalks were producing. The ear of corn that I reached down and selected snapped too easily from the stalk. This not yet shucked ear of corn was barely bigger than two rolls of quarters. I saw the conditions of the cattle and pastureland in West Virginia. I saw the dry, cracked fields; I saw the stunted corn stalks; and I heard the stories of farmers. It all amounts to a heart-breaking picture. 
   I urge my colleagues to help all cattle farmers in areas declared as Federal disaster areas as a result of excessive heat or drought, and to support my provision in their behalf. My amendment will ensure direct relief to the cattle farmers in the Northeast affected by this natural disaster. It will serve to bolster other important aid for fruit and crop losses. 
   The sweltering temperatures have taken their toll on farmers in the Mid-Atlantic region. Let us not turn the heat up further. Let us support the small family farmer in his or her hour of need.  
   My amendment is a part of the Daschle-Harkin bill. I thank all Senators for listening. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today I voted against the Medicare Sense of the Senate amendment numbered 1467, offered by Senator FRIST. For the benefit of my constituents in West Virginia, I offer a brief explanation for why I voted the way I did. 
   I opposed Senator FRIST's amendment because, in my judgment, it is based on a fiction. As we all know, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has projected a $996 billion non-Social Security surplus over the next ten years. The Frist amendment said that, even allowing for the $792 billion tax cut, there was still enough money left over to provide for the long-term solvency of the Medicare system. One need not be an economist, or even an expert in budget policy, to understand why that was just plain wrong. 
   The Republican tax cut plan will cost $971 billion over the next ten years--$792 billion for the actual tax cut, plus $179 billion in additional interest payments on the debt. That leaves $25 billion of the non-Social Security surplus. From that amount, the Republicans have said we can provide for emergency expenditures for natural disasters and international conflicts, which averages $80 billion over ten years; fund current operations of government; and reserve enough money for Medicare. And, as I say, they would do all that without using the Social Security surplus. As anyone can plainly see, that is just not possible. In all good conscience, I could not vote for the Frist amendment.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will vote against this Republican tax cut plan. I cannot conceive of a more ill-advised fiscal plan for the Nation over the next 10 years than the Republican tax cut bill. I say this for a number of reasons. 
   Having seen the National debt explode from less than $1 trillion on the day that President Reagan took office to over $5.6 trillion today, we should have learned that the supply-side economic theories of the Reagan-Bush years, which called for massive tax cuts together with a massive defense build-up, while at the same time balancing the federal budget, are pure, unadulterated hogwash. They didn't work then; they won't work now. 
   Thankfully, due to a number of factors--for example, the fiscal policies of the Federal Reserve, and improvements in the productivity of the Nation's businesses--we have been able not only to stem the tide of red ink that ran into the triple-digit billion-dollar levels for each of the Reagan-Bush years but, if the latest projections of both the OMB and CBO pan out, we also can look forward to huge federal surpluses each year as far as the eye can see. That's good news, if those projections come true and if Congress is able to withstand another round of tax cut fever. 
   The Congressional Budget Office projects surpluses over the next ten years (FY 2000-2009) totaling nearly $3 trillion. Of that amount, about $2 trillion would be surpluses in the Social Security Trust Fund, and the other $1 trillion ($996 billion to be exact) would be non-social security surpluses. However, a closer look at these non-social security surpluses projected by CBO over the next ten years, reveals that they rest on a very shaky foundation. The fact is, these non-social security surpluses which are projected to total $996 billion, are based in large part on huge cuts in investments and national priorities--such as national security, veterans' medical care, the FBI and other crime-fighting programs, the environment, agriculture, border patrol agents, health research, education, and many other critical programs. Of the $996 billion in non-social security surpluses projected by CBO for the next 10 years, $595 billion results from real and devastating cuts in these national priorities. As if that were not bad enough, the Republican tax cut plan calls for additional cuts of some $180 billion to these same programs. That makes a total of $775 billion in cuts in these national investments over the next 10 years. That is what is being proposed in the Republican tax cut bill now before the Senate. Furthermore, the Republican tax cuts of $792 billion would, if enacted, also result in increased interest on the Federal Debt over the next 10 years totaling $179 billion. In reality, then, the Republican tax cut bill eats up $971 billion of the $996 billion in projected non-social security surpluses over the next 10 years, leaving only $25 billion remaining. 
   We should heed the advice of Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan in his testimony before Congressional Committees when he advised caution when considering what to do with these projected surpluses. In the first place, it is extremely unlikely that these projections will come true. The fact is that CBO's estimates of revenues over the past two decades have been off by an absolute average of $38 billion per year; their estimates on spending over that period have 
   been off by $36 billion per year; and their deficit/surplus projections have been off by an absolute average of $54 billion per year over the past two decades. If these averages hold up over the next 10 years, the trillion-dollar non-social security surpluses could be slashed by $540 billion purely due to mis-estimates by the Congressional Budget Office. Further, as CBO states in virtually every report that they publish, cyclical disturbances such as recessions, changes in interest rates, inflation, etc., could have significant effects on their projected surpluses at any time during the projection period. 
   Then, there is the question of emergency spending. As Senators are aware, under the Budget Enforcement Act, unforeseen emergencies, which cannot be predicted accurately and, therefore, are not budgeted, are allowed to be funded outside the spending caps that have been in place since 1990 and which will remain in place through FY2002. The fact is, emergency spending over the past decade (other than spending for Desert Storm/Desert Shield and the $21 billion in emergency spending in the FY1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act) has averaged $8 billion per year. In other words, but for those two instances, Congress has enacted spending outside of the budgetary caps for such things as disaster assistance to the nation's farmers, relief for victims of floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, and earthquakes, as well as assistance for victims of similar occurrences overseas. 
   That type of assistance has averaged $8 billion per year since 1990. There is no indication that these natural disasters will suddenly cease. To the contrary, there is substantial evidence that they have become more frequent and more severe in the latter part of this Century. What does this mean? It means that it is highly likely that over the next decade, at least $80 billion in emergency spending will be needed. But, keep in mind that the $996 billion in non-social security surpluses projected by CBO, the large bulk of which results from real cuts in national priorities, does not allow for any emergency spending over the next 10 years. That being the case, wouldn't it be prudent to reduce the $996 billion projection by at least the $80 billion historical average per decade that we have seen in the past? After so doing, even if Congress and the Administration agreed to the $775 billion of cuts in purchasing power for national priorities that the Republican tax cut bill requires, there would not be sufficient surpluses remaining to cover this Republican tax cut plan without either reverting back into deficit spending, or repealing the tax cut, or dipping into the Social Security Trust Fund surpluses. 
   Next, let's look at the question of whether Congress can, or should, stay within the existing spending caps for FY2000, much less the more difficult caps of FY2001 and FY2002. One need only pick up the morning newspaper on any one of the past several days to find an article or two discussing the progress, or lack thereof, that the Appropriations Committees are making in completing action on the FY2000 funding bills. Recently, it is reported, the House Appropriations Committee found that the VA-HUD Subcommittee could not stay within its allocations without declaring some $3 billion in funding for VA medical care, as well as $2.5 billion in FEMA funding, as ``emergency'' spending, which as I have explained earlier, does not count against the spending caps, but will, nonetheless, decrease the surplus. Additionally, some $4.5 billion has been declared emergency spending for the Decennial Census by the House Appropriations Committee. Those three items alone, if enacted as emergency spending, will cut 
   the projected FY2000 surplus by $10 billion. Furthermore, as CBO points out on page 6 of their mid-Session Review, they have been directed by the Budget Committees to reduce their outlay projections in FY2000 by $10 billion for defense, $1 billion for transportation, and $3 billion for other non-defense programs. That knocks another $14 billion dent in CBO's non-social security surplus projections for FY2000. On that same page, CBO also points out that their non-social security surplus projections exclude some $3 billion per year in spending for the administrative expenses of the Social Security Administration. When all of these factors are taken into account, for FY2000, actions by Congress to date have already added emergency spending of some $10 billion; and have increased outlays by $14 billion. This $24 billion, together with the $3 billion in administrative expenses for the Social Security Administration, means that Congress is likely to not only spend all of the $14 billion FY2000 non-social security surplus projected by CBO, but, actually, to exceed it by at least $13 billion. In other words, it is highly likely that for FY2000 alone, Congress and the Administration will enact spending levels which will not only use up the entire $14 billion non-social security surplus projected for that year,  but will also eat into the Social Security Trust Fund surpluses by at least $13 billion. So much for the Social Security Lock-box! Congress has already found the key that unlocks it. What about next year, when the spending caps are much tougher to stay within? Is one to believe that Congress will make the Draconian cuts in national priorities that would be called for to stay within the Republican tax plan? If not, further erosion of these projected surpluses will occur. Keep in mind that once tax cuts are enacted, those revenues are gone, and can only be retrieved by repealing the tax cuts. Does anyone think that Congress will do that in an Election Year? If not, then it is a foregone conclusion that the surplus projections for even the upcoming three fiscal years, to say nothing of the remaining seven years of the next decade, will be eaten away because they are based on virtually impossible, and extremely unsound, cuts in spending on national priorities. Keeping two sets of books, as the Republicans are attempting to do, won't fool the American people for very long. 
   In closing, Mr. President, let me quote from the text of a recent statement by 50 of the Nation's most revered economists, including six Nobel laureates, concerning the tax cuts now before the Senate.  
   The federal budget is projected to show substantial surpluses over the next 15 years. These surpluses offer an exceptional opportunity to pay down government debt and thereby strengthen Social Security and Medicare in order to prepare for the retirement of the baby boomers. ..... 
   In contrast, a massive tax cut that encourages consumption would not be good economic policy. With the unemployment rate at its lowest point in a generation, now is the wrong time to stimulate the economy through tax cuts. Moreover, an ever growing tax cut would drain government resources just when the aging of the population starts to put substantial stress on Social Security and Medicare. Further, the projections assume substantial undesirable reductions in real spending for non-entitlement programs, including important public investments. Given the uncertainty of long-term budget projections, committing to a large tax cut would create significant risks to the budget and the economy.  
   Mr. President, it could not be any clearer to any rational human being that this Republican tax cut plan is exactly the wrong fiscal blueprint for the Nation as we enter the next Millennium. As I have shown, it is highly unlikely that these forecasts will come true. Even if they do, some $80 billion in emergency spending for natural disasters has not been accounted for; another $30 billion in administrative costs of the Social Security Administration has not been accounted for; and the budget caps for FY2000 alone are likely to be exceeded by over $20 billion. Now is not the time to return to the failed economic policies that prevailed during the Reagan-Bush years. Rosy Scenario in all her splendor could not make their policies work. The same is true of the policies that would be undertaken if we were to enact this Republican tax cut.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, recently both the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office released their so-called ``Mid-Session Reviews'' on the state of the Federal budget. Both of these new forecasts project even better performance for the nation's economy in the coming ten years than they had predicted just a few months ago. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office projects unified budget surpluses totaling just under $3 trillion over the next ten years. Of the $3 trillion, approximately $2 trillion results from surpluses being paid into the Social Security trust fund. The remaining $1 trillion--or $996 billion to be exact--is what is called the ``on budget'' surplus. That is the non-Social Security trust fund surplus. The question before Congress is what do we do with this good news--our government is about to be awash in money, if these projections come true. 
   Before we get too far along with our grandiose plans for massive tax cuts, a dose of reality is in order. Sometimes a dose of castor oil is in order. We may not like it so much, but it has to be taken. So a dose of reality is in order.  
   These future budget surpluses are, of course, based on ``pie in the sky'' projections. But I don't think ``pie in the sky'' is quite right. The projections are so far out into the Stratosphere--more than a decade away--that we would need the Hubble Telescope to track them down. 
   Mr. President, the fact is that they have not yet occurred, the money is not yet in hand--and may well never occur--for a number of reasons. First, one needs to keep in mind that budget projections for even 1 year are likely to be missed by a substantial margin over the normal 5-year period of congressional budgets. Estimates of deficits and surpluses have been off by billions of dollars. This year, for the first time, instead of 5-year budget projections, we have 10-year budget projections upon which all of the surpluses are being forecast, and upon which tax cut proposals by Democrats, Republicans and the administration are being based. 
   Does anyone really believe that these 10-year projections will be any more accurate than the usual 5-year numbers? In looking at these incredible amounts of surpluses and tax cuts, I would think that one needs more of an astrologer than an economist to read the tea leaves and to come up with these figures. 
   Mr. President, consider these facts: CBO's estimate of revenues over the period 1980 through 1998 was off by an absolute average of $38 billion per year. The estimates were off by an average of $38 billion per year during the period 1980 through 1998. That is a pretty fair piece of change! This isn't just chicken feed. Some years, the estimates were closer to the projection than other years, but, as I say, the average difference one way or the other, was $38 billion per year. Similarly, for outlays, the projections over the past two decades were off the mark by an absolute average of $36 billion per year. The resulting deficit projections by the Congressional Budget Office over the period 1980 through 1998 were off by an absolute average of $54 billion per year. Extend that figure over 10 years, and that is what we are doing now in this bill, and we can see that $540 billion of the $1 trillion projected surplus could melt away faster than last year's snowball. 
   So what about these latest ``rosy'' forecasts of budgetary surpluses for the next 10 years? It is obvious that we need to be very careful when relying on such projections to make decisions about whether and if we can afford a tax cut. 
   CBO officials would be the first to tell you that they have widely missed the mark in their budgetary forecasts, as would the folks at OMB. No one on the face of God's green Earth can predict accurately for even 1 year, much less for 5 or 10 years, what revenues will come into the Treasury, or what expenditures will go out of the Treasury. That is because no one knows what the unemployment rate will be next year, or the inflation rate, interest rates, whether there will be a recession or the duration or virility of such recession. In virtually every CBO report, the following cautionary footnote can be found: ``Cyclical disturbances could have a significant effect on the budget at any time during the projection period. A recession would temporarily push down taxable incomes, thus reducing federal revenues. A recession would also cause a boost in spending for unemployment insurance and other benefit programs. CBO estimates that a relatively mild recession (similar to the one in the early 1990s) that began this year could reduce the projected surplus by $55 billion in 2000.'' 
   Mr. President, there is no reason to believe that CBO's current forecast of the budgetary picture over the next 10 years will be any more accurate than have been its previous forecasts over the past two decades. 
   With that dose of reality in mind, let's now turn our attention to the Republican tax cut proposal now before the Senate. Earlier in my remarks, I noted that the Congressional Budget Office projects an on-budget surplus of $996 billion over the coming 10 years FY 2000-2009. The on-budget surplus calculations, it should be noted, are the monies not needed for Social Security or the Postal Service, and not otherwise spent. The Republican tax cut plan proposes to use virtually all of these projected on-budget surpluses for tax cuts of $792 billion and for paying the increased interest on the federal debt of $179 billion. This leaves only $25 billion in projected surpluses for the next 10 years. 
   What happens if we enact cuts of $792 billion and the CBO projections turn out to be wrong? What happens if they turn out to be wrong, as they have always been? What will Congress do then? The money will by law be leaving the Treasury everyday in the form of tax cuts, but there may be an inadequate surplus to cover them. Will Congress repeal the tax cut? It is easy to vote for a tax cut. Will Congress repeal the tax cut? Will it be able to cut spending even further than the Republican budget--which I will say more about later--already calls for? Will it dip into the Social Security trust fund then? Or, will Congress find it easier to revert back into the bad old days of the 1980s and simply run up massive annual deficits? Those are the four choices we will have. All of them are unacceptable. We must not mislead the American people by promising them massive tax cuts which may well be based only on phantom surpluses which never materialize. 
   Even if the surpluses do happen, this Republican tax plan could emasculate national security, public investments, and the operations of government. As this chart shows, these areas of the Federal budget could suffer real cuts each year, beginning in fiscal year 2000, drastically below what would be necessary to continue them at the levels provided in fiscal year 1999. In fact, over the whole 10-year period--over the 10-year period--the real reductions would total $775 billion. In other words, the bulk of the $792 billion Republican tax cut is likely, in reality, to be financed by cuts in critical domestic 
   priorities--critical domestic priorities--such as education, health care, infrastructure, child care, the environment, agriculture--that will affect you, the people of this country--old, young, white, black, male, female. They will affect you--you--because they will be financed by cuts in critical domestic priorities. 
   Mr. President, to give the American people some sense of what I am talking about, let me focus on just three critical areas of the Federal budget that would be thus affected. 
   First, however, let me point out that the cuts in these programs are based on the assumption that the Republicans will fund defense at the levels requested by President Clinton over the next 10 years. If that is so, and the tax cuts are also enacted, according to the Office of Management and Budget, an across-the-board cut of 38 percent--that is more than a third--in outlays will be required in the other public investments and operations of the Federal Government. 
   For example, let us take a look at the VA medical care program. 
   That gets close to home. We are already getting lots of mail, lots of telephone calls, e-mails, and so on, from veterans and their families. So let's take a look at the VA medical care program. 
   What would happen to veterans' health care under the Republican tax cut plan if these cuts are administered in an across-the-board manner? The cuts will rise from $931 million in fiscal year 2000 to over $11.5 billion in fiscal year 2009. In total, the cumulative cuts to the VA medical program--as I say, we are already hearing a lot from veterans because they see these cuts coming--the cumulative cuts to the VA medical program for this 10-year period will be more than $53.5 billion below what it would take to continue current VA medical care services. I might add, as I say, some veterans are already feeling it, and this figure is woefully inadequate. 
   What do those cuts mean in human terms? As we can see from this chart, OMB projects that 3,252,735 veterans--not talking about dollars now; we are talking about real people, veterans in particular--OMB projects that 3,252,735 veterans will seek treatment at VA medical facilities in fiscal year 2000. That is just over the horizon, fiscal year 2000. Under the Republican tax plan, though, 102,278 of these veterans are going to have to be turned away: Sorry, that program has been reduced, or that program has been cut out; we do not have room for you. 
   As we can see, over the 10-year period the number of veterans to be turned away--sorry, sorry, we have to turn you away--will increase each year  until fiscal year 2009, when, according to these figures, 1,430,985 veterans will be denied critical health care benefits. Is that how a grateful Nation treats its soldiers, sailors, and airmen? 
   Now, let's look at national crime-fighting programs. 
   Mr. President, the budget for the Federal Bureau of Investigation was approximately $3 billion in FY 1999. Paying for the Republican tax cuts would require reductions in the FBI budget below what would be needed to continue current services over each of the next 10 years. Those cuts get progressively worse until in FY 2009, the Republican tax cut would require a cut of almost $1.9 billion below the $4.3 billion that would be necessary just to maintain--just to maintain--the same level of service being provided by the FBI in 1999. Over this 10-year period, total cuts to the FBI's budget would equal almost $9 billion. 
   That is $9 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born. Nine billion dollars, that is a lot of money! 
   Again, Mr. President, what does this translate to in services to the American people? Forget the dollars for a moment. As this chart shows, the FBI will need 10,687 agents in each of the next 10 years in order to just continue its current law enforcement efforts. But, that will not be possible if we enact the Republican tax cuts. Instead, we can look forward to progressively--progressively--deeper reductions in the number of FBI agents in each of the next 10 years. In FY 2009, rather than being able to employ 10,687 agents, the FBI will only be able to employ, 5,878. Is that what the American people want? And what does that do to our efforts to prevent another World Trade Center bombing? What does it do to our efforts to prevent another Oklahoma City bombing? What do cuts of that magnitude do to our programs to fight organized crime, or the insidious proliferation of child pornography on the Internet? 
   Sadly, the picture is no better for the effort to patrol our Nation's borders. Progressively deeper budget cuts will have to be made over the next 10 years totaling more than $3.5 billion because of the massive Republican tax cuts. As a result, as we can see displayed in this next chart, the number of INS agents--Immigration and Naturalization Service agents--protecting the Nation's borders will decline from the needed level of 8,947 to only 4,921 in the year 2009. How does that help address the problem of illegal immigration? And that is a big, big, big problem. How do those kind of cuts help our drug interdiction efforts? What kind of message does that send to the Colombian drug lords? 
   Mr. President, these are just three--just three--examples of the short-sheeting that will take place throughout the entire Federal Government because of the Republican tax plan. As if this weren't bad enough, the real kicker in the Republican tax cut plan is that not only does it cut taxes by almost a trillion dollars over the next 10 years but--get this--this tax cut package would explode in the following 10 years, costing roughly an additional $1.8 trillion, according to preliminary projections by the Treasury Department. Also, the Treasury Department points out that interest on the national debt in the second 10 years caused by the $1.8 trillion in lost revenues would be roughly $1.1 trillion higher. 
   Let me say that again. The Treasury Department points out that interest on the national debt in the second 10 years caused by the $1.8 trillion in lost revenues would be roughly $1.1 trillion higher. 
   That makes a total cost of the Republican tax cut plan in the years 2010 through 2019 of $2.9 trillion. 
   The increased interest due on the national debt of $1.1 trillion caused by the Republican tax cut plan is greater than the total amount of their tax cut for the first ten years, which was $792 billion. These massive drains on the U.S. Treasury would take place at the very time when the baby-boom generation is retiring in huge numbers and placing a great strain on the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. This tax cut plan, in my view, represents the absolute omega of irresponsibility. It passes on to our children and grandchildren in the years 2010 through 2019 a $2.9 trillion drain on the U.S. Treasury. The Republican tax cut would have us spend $2.9 trillion over the decade 2010 through 2019 right now, regardless of whether that drain makes it impossible for the country to meet its Social Security and Medicare obligations for its senior citizens. 
   Recently the Washington Post carried a political cartoon by Herblock on one of its pages, which I have here on this chart. As one can see, at the top of the cartoon appeared these words: ``Back for an indefinite run!'' 
   Let me say that again: ``Back for an indefinite run!'' ``Rosy Scenario''--whoopee, we have heard of her, haven't we? ``Rosy Scenario--and her long line of stunning surplus sugarplums.'' 
   The cartoon depicts Rosy--there she is, all ready for the show--in a costume with dancing girls and throwing dollar bills in the air. There is a song, ``Pennies from Heaven.'' But Mr. President, these are dollar bills! Holy Smoke! Rosy Scenario is throwing them all about us. In front of the theater in which she is appearing, what do we see? We see two eager customers about to buy their tickets for the show. One appears to be an elephant; one appears to be a donkey. They are both depicted in business attire. The ticket salesman seems to have a cynical smirk on his face, as though he knows something that the elephant and the donkey, who are waiting for their tickets, don't know. 
   When I saw this cartoon, it brought back memories about Rosy. She first appeared on the scene in 1981 as a major player in the Reagan revolution. When President Reagan took office, that so-called revolution was based on supply-side economic ideology that called for massive tax cuts. That was before more than two-thirds of the Senators here today arrived--almost two-thirds, to be exact. Sixty-three Senators are here today who were not here when I was majority leader the third time, 1987 and 1988. But we are talking about 1981. Even more Senators were not here then. 
   That so-called revolution was based on supply-side economic ideology that called, again, for massive tax cuts, a large buildup in defense spending, and balancing the Federal budget; all were going to be done. Those were the principal budgetary concepts the Reagan revolution put forth. 
   There were many skeptics at the time as to whether those policies would actually work. I was one of those skeptics. The Senate majority leader, Howard Baker, called it a ``riverboat gamble.'' Nevertheless, in 1981 Congress did enact a huge tax cut, and it did increase defense spending. Entitlement spending also continued to grow. What was the result? The result was an era of the largest Federal deficits by far in history. 
   Furthermore, ``Rosy Scenario'' worked her magic numbers in the budget under the direction of President Reagan's chief financial adviser, OMB Director David Stockman. As a result of those policies, rather than ridding the country of Federal deficits, the country saw for the first time in history triple-digit billion dollar deficits in each of Mr. Reagan's eight years in office. 
   In fact, the national debt stood at $932 billion on January 20, 1981, the date President Reagan took office. Unfortunately, on the day that President Reagan left office on January 20, 1989, the national debt stood at $2,683,000,000,000. 
   This chart depicts the major causes of increased Federal debt for fiscal years 1981 through 1991. It shows that the 1981 tax cut over that 10-year period, cost the Treasury $2.1 trillion. Those tax cuts were offset by a series of tax increases that became necessary during the Reagan years in an attempt to decrease Federal deficits. Those tax increases equaled $800 billion. Entitlement and defense spending each grew by $600 billion above inflation over this 10-year period. Interest on the climbing national debt increased by $500 billion. The S&L bailout cost $200 billion. And, domestic spending was cut over that 10-year period by $400 billion below inflation. That was a very unfortunate and difficult period in our national history. 
   The folly of the Reagan Revolution's fiscal policies is set forth in great detail in the book entitled, ``The Triumph of Politics'' by David Stockman. As I previously pointed out, David Stockman was the principal architect of the Reagan budgets until he left the Administration in 1985. Perhaps the  best summary of the conclusions reached by Mr. Stockman is found in the epilogue of the book found on pages 378-379.  
   The fundamental reality of 1984 was not the advent of a new day, but a lapse into fiscal indiscipline on a scale never before experienced in peacetime. There is no basis in economic history or theory for believing that from this wobbly foundation a lasting era of prosperity can actually emerge.  
   Will we never learn! 
   Cicero said, ``To be ignorant of what occurred before you were born is to remain always a child.'' That is the value of history. That is what we are talking about, history, and history is about to repeat itself. 
   This can be a year of great opportunity for the Nation if Congress and the administration can work together on our budget priorities for the coming decade. I do not think Congress needs to choose an all-or-nothing course of action, but we do need to jettison the political pandering that is going on. This should not be an ``us versus them'' battle; it is not a ``big government versus little people'' battle. So what should Congress do? The same as any wise investor would do: 
   1, watch our investments carefully and manage them prudently. Manage the economy and watch out for inflation; 
   2, pay our debt. Pay down the national debt; 3, cover the necessities. Don't short change our Nation's core programs, such as education, health care and the like; 4, put aside what we need to put aside for a rainy day. Reserve the Social Security and Medicare surpluses exclusively for future costs of those programs; 5, take prosperity in measured doses. Ease up on taxes without pulling the rug out from under projected surpluses. 
   After years of struggling to overcome a sluggish economy and mounting deficits, America is well-launched on an economic renaissance. I hope we in Congress can rise to the challenge and serve as wise stewards of this economic prosperity. I hope we can put aside our political posturing and act in the best interests of the American people and the American Nation. 
   Before the Congress takes this folly of a plunge, perhaps it is a good time for a bit of a history lesson. It was more than 50 years ago when the Republican-controlled 80th Congress approved a massive $4 billion tax cut. That was a massive tax cut--$4 billion--in those days. President Harry Truman--one of my favorite Presidents--vetoed that tax cut, calling the Republicans ``bloodsuckers with offices on Wall Street.'' I am quoting Mr. Truman as saying that. It took three times, but the Republican majority overturned that veto. 
   In his nomination speech before the Democratic National Convention, President Truman put forth an idea that we need to recall today. He said that ``everybody likes to have low taxes, but we must reduce the national debt in times of prosperity. And when tax relief can be given, it ought to go to those who need it most and not those who need it least, as this Republican rich man's tax bill did.'' 
   Just as an aside, not only did Mr. Truman upset Mr. Dewey that year, but the Democrats regained control of the Congress. The American people know when the Congress is dealing with them squarely and wisely. They also know when the Congress is playing political games with their futures. 
   I am reminded, in closing, of the lesson conveyed by Chaucer in ``The Pardoner's Tale.'' Three young men, searching to find and destroy Death, were directed to a tree under which they found bushels of gold coins. They immediately forgot all about their quest to find and murder Death, and they set to plotting how to get the gold safely home. They decided to wait until darkness fell, and they drew lots to see which of the three would be sent into town to buy food and wine for all of them. The youngest was chosen. While he was gone, the other two decided to kill him upon his return so as to keep more of the gold for themselves. In the meanwhile, the youngest, as he went into town, decided to poison the other two so as to keep it all for himself. When he returned to the tree, the two waiting men pounced upon him and killed him. And then they drank the poisoned wine and died. 
   Let us heed the warning of ``The Pardoner's Tale'' and not allow the glitter of gold to blind us to the common good of the Nation. Congress has the ability, the wisdom, and the means to chart a wise budget course for our Nation's future. Let us hope that Congress can also muster the maturity to put aside election year rhetoric in favor of sound fiscal policy. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I speak today in support of the fiscal year 2000 Interior and Related Agencies appropriation bill. This is an important bill which provides for the management of our Nation's natural resources, funds research critical to our energy future, supports the well-being of our Indian populations, and protects the historical and cultural heritage of our country. I urge the Senate to move swiftly in its consideration of this appropriation bill. 
   It has been my privilege to serve as the ranking member for this bill at the side of our very able chairman, the senior Senator from Washington. Senator GORTON has done an outstanding job in crafting the bill and balancing its many competing interests, a particularly daunting challenge this year in light of the spending caps within which the Appropriations Committee must operate. Even in the best of years, crafting the Interior bill is not an easy task. 
   The Interior bill remains one of the most popular appropriation bills, funding a diverse set of very worthy programs and projects. The bill is full of thousands of relatively small, yet very meaningful details. Our chairman is a master of the complexities of the Interior bill. It is a pleasure to work on this appropriations bill with Senator GORTON at the helm. He has treated the Senators fairly and openly. This bill was put together in a bipartisan manner, and it reflects priorities identified by Senators, by the public, and by the agencies which are charged with carrying out the programs and projects funded in the bill. 
   The breadth of the activities covered by the Interior bill is vast--ranging from museums to parks to hospitals to resources to research--with most of the funds being spent far away from the capital. This bill funds hundreds of national parks, wildlife refuges, national forests, and other land management units. This bill supports more than 400 Indian hospitals and clinics and thousands of Indian students. A wide variety of natural science and energy research and technology development are funded through this bill, providing immediate and far-reaching benefits to all parts of our Nation and to our society as a whole. 
   This bill makes its presence known in every State--from the rocky coasts of Maine to the mountains of California, from the coral reefs of Florida to the far flung island territories of the Pacific, from the Aleutian Islands in Alaska to the Outer Banks of North Carolina. And the number of requests Senator GORTON and I have received from Senators for project funding in the Interior bill--more than 2,400 requests for specific items--reflects its broad impact. While it is impossible to include every request, Senator GORTON has done an admirable job of accommodating high-priority items within the allocation, an allocation that is $1.13 billion below the President's budget request and nearly $20 million below last year's enacted level of $13.94 billion in new discretionary spending authority. 
   Highlights of this bill include: 
   A total of $234 million for federal land acquisition, which is $178 million below the President's fiscal year 2000 request (with reprogrammings) and $94 million below the level of funding included in the fiscal year 1999 act for land acquisition. 
   A continuing emphasis on operating and protecting our national parks. Park operation funds are increased by $70 million, including increases of $19 million for resource stewardship, $16 million for visitor services, and $20 million for park maintenance. 
   A continuing focus on the operational needs of the other land management agencies. The bill contains an increase of $24 million for the operating accounts of the Bureau of Land Management, including a $9 million increase for range management. The bill also provides an increase of $22 million for the resource management account of the Fish and Wildlife Service, including an increase of $13 million for refuge operations and maintenance. 
   The bill contains $159 million for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, allowing operation of the reserve without selling any of its oil. 
   Fossil energy research and development is funded at $395 million (with use of transfers and prior year balances), which is an increase above both the enacted level (by $11 million) and the request level (by $27 million). Specific increases also are provided for select energy conservation programs in building research and standards, transportation technology and specific industries of the future activities. 
   While this bill provides needed resources for protecting some of our nation's most valuable treasures, we still have a long way to go. The agencies funded through this bill are starting to make progress towards addressing their operational and maintenance issues, thanks to the leadership of the Congress. But we are by no means out of the woods. Many deplorable conditions remain; many important resource and research needs are unmet. We must continue our vigilance towards unnecessary new initiatives as well as unwise decreases, our support for the basic programs that provide the foundation of the Interior bill, and our careful stewardship of the resources and assets placed in our trust. 
   Lastly, I extend a warm word of appreciation to the staff that have assisted the Chairman and myself in our work on this bill. They work as a team and serve both of us, as well as all Senators, in a very effective and dedicated manner. On the majority side, the staff members are Bruce Evans, Ginny James, Anne McInerney, Leif Fonnesbeck, Joseph Norrell, and Sean Marsan. On my staff, Kurt Dodd, Carole Geagley, and Liz Gelfer have worked on the Interior Bill this year. This team works under the tutelage of the staff directors of the full committee--Steve Cortese for the majority and Jim English for the minority. 
   Mr. President, this is a good bill, and I urge the Senate to complete its action promptly. 
   Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. 
   We have just witnessed what is wrong with this Senate. I have been yielded 25 minutes. We don't have time today to properly discuss one of the most fundamental questions that ever comes before this Senate: fundamental freedom of speech; freedom of debate; freedom to offer amendments. 
   I am limited to 25 minutes. Yes, I agreed to this 6-hour rule, but you can see how it is playing out. Most of the 3 hours allotted to the minority are being played out over here. Nobody is talking on the other side. Perhaps one, two, or three Senators will. I think the distinguished Senator who now presides over the Senate made some remarks earlier. But the point of it is, the minority will have said about all it has time to say under this agreement, and then its time will have run out. As a consequence, the majority will be able to speak during the latter hours or moments, and there won't be much time for real debate. 
   Mr. President, I am in my 41st year in this body. I was in the other body for 6 years. I saw the actions of the other body. When I came to the Senate, I wanted to come to the Senate. I wanted to come to a forum in which one could speak as long as his feet would hold him, as long as he could stand, and the floor could not be taken away from him by the Chair, a majority leader, or anybody else. He could speak for as long as he wished. 
   For all these years, I have talked about this institution, about its importance in the constitutional system, about the fact that it is the only forum of the States, the only forum in this Government, where small States such as West Virginia have the same powers, the same prerogatives, the same rights, along with the same responsibilities as the States that are great in territory and in population, such as California, Texas, Florida, New York, and others. I wanted to be in this forum. William Ewart Gladstone referred to the Senate of the United States, as ``that remarkable body, the most remarkable of all the inventions of modern politics.'' 
   But it is getting to where this Senate is not so remarkable. There are things unique about the Senate that were meant to be unique, that were made unique by virtue of the framers of the Constitution. Among those, of course, is the responsibility to approve the resolutions of ratification of treaties, to approve nominations, and to act as a court in the trial of impeachments. But aside from those several unique things, the two things in particular that make this body the most unique of any upper body in the world, the most unique Senate that has ever existed--and there have been many senates--is the fact that this Senate has the right to amend bills, and Senators have the right to speak and to debate at length. 
   The right to debate and the right to amend: The right to amend is mentioned in that provision of the Constitution that says revenue bills shall originate in the House of Representatives, but the Senate shall have the right to amend as in all other bills. So there it is. The Senate has the right to amend, and Senators have the right to debate at length. 
   Now, I have been majority leader. I have been elected to the majority leadership three times--twice during the Carter years and once during the 100th Congress. When I came to the Senate, Lyndon Johnson was majority leader; then there was Mike Mansfield; I was the next majority leader; Howard Baker then became majority leader followed by Bob Dole, and then, in the 100th Congress, I was majority leader again, George Mitchell followed me as majority leader and then Bob Dole became the Majority Leader a second time. Mr. LOTT is now the majority  leader. So I have seen several majority leaders operate in this Senate. 
   Mr. President, I think the Senate is losing its uniqueness in that we are being deprived, in considerable measure, of the right to debate, the right to debate at length. If I come up 
   here and want a few minutes to speak about the departing of some deceased friend, or some other matter--it may not be one of the great moments in history--I can't come up here and speak as I used to be able to. I can't get the floor. And when I get the floor, I am limited. I don't like that. 
   I can understand the importance of having time limitations, and we do enter into time limitations. We have always done that, when there is a unanimous consent agreement limiting time, or the Senate is operating under a cloture motion. Otherwise, there is no limitation on debate and there is no germaneness of amendments under the Senate rules, except under rule XVI, when appropriation matters are before the Senate and also when cloture is invoked. Otherwise, we have freedom of debate. 
   Woodrow Wilson said that the information function of the legislative branch is as important as the legislative function. It is through debate that we inform the American people. It is through debate that we better inform ourselves. 
   I was in a meeting with the British over the weekend, the British-American Group. We met in West Virginia at the Greenbrier. Senator REID was there. Senators on both sides of the aisle were there, including the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. DOMENICI. We didn't win or lose. We each came away being better informed by the other side. We didn't agree with the British point of view on certain issues and they didn't agree with ours, but we all came away better informed. We had a better understanding of what their viewpoint was and the reasons for it, and, hopefully, they have a better viewpoint of our reasoning. 
   But here in the Senate, it has become dog-eat-dog. It has become very partisan--very partisan. Politics is very important, and political party is important. But some things are more important than political party. One of those things is the right to debate and the right to amend. It isn't for the benefit of the Democratic Party that I want the right to amend. It is not for the benefit of the Democratic Party that I want the right to debate. It is for the benefit of the American people. That is why the Senate is here. There were no political parties when this Senate was first created. But it seems that, anymore, the idea is that the majority is always to have its way while the minority is to be shut out and, in some ways, gagged. 
   That approach does not benefit the people of America. 
   I say these things with misgivings because I have many friends on the other side of the aisle. I think that the Senators in the leadership on that side of the aisle are friends of mine. But we are talking about the Senate here today and not the party. I don't come to the Senate floor today emphasizing party. I am here today because I am seeing the right of the minority to engage in free debate and to offer amendments shut off in some instances. 
   There is a complaint here that too many amendments are offered on this side of the aisle to bills. This side of the aisle, as does that side of the aisle, has a right to offer whatever amendments they wish to offer. 
   When I was majority leader, I never said to the minority leader: Now, you are going to be limited. You have too many amendments. We are not going to take the bill up; or, we will let you have 5 amendments, or no more than 10. What are your amendments? I never said that. 
   I said to Members on both sides of the aisle: Let us know what your amendments are. Let the people at the front table here know what your amendments are on both sides. Call the Cloakrooms. Let's find out what amendments there are yet outstanding. There might have been 40. There might have been 55. There might have been 75. But I didn't go back and say: We are going to pull this bill down if you do not cut your amendments down to 10. Never did I say that. Never did I say you can only call up five, or so, amendments. How many do you have? Then we got the list. Then I said: Now, let's try to get a unanimous consent to limit the amendments to this number--whatever it was, be it 50 or 60 or whatever. Let's try to get an agreement to 
   limit the amendments to this list. 
   So when we put that word out, other amendments came out of the wall--another half a dozen and another dozen. They just kept coming. 
   But finally we had a list of amendments. We agreed that those then would be all. Then we would go to the individual Members on the list and say: Are you willing to enter into a time agreement on your amendment? 
   Sometimes some of the amendments would peel off and we wouldn't end up with all that many amendments, or Members would be agreeable to a time limit. But never did I attempt to muzzle the minority. 
   I took the position, let the minority call up their amendments. We can move to table them. Or, in many instances, they insisted on an up-or-down vote, and we gave them an up-or-down vote. We could defeat the amendment, in many instances. But in some instances their amendments carried, which was all right. That is what the legislative process is all about. 
   The majority is not always right as we have often seen throughout the course of history. Many times the minority throughout history has been right. We are not serving the good interests of the American people when we muzzle the ox. 
   The Bible says: ``Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn.'' The Senate is the ox. It is the central pillar of this Republic. This isn't a democracy; it is a Republic. The Senate is the central pillar. The Senate is where we can debate at length and offer amendments. 
   As long as there is a Senate and men and women can debate to their hearts' content and offer amendments, the people's liberties will be secure. But once the Senate is muzzled, the people's liberties are in danger. 
   The majority is virtually all powerful here. They have the votes, which is all right, but they must recognize that the minority has rights. That is why the Senate is like it is. That is what it was meant to be--a bastion for protection of the minority. 
   Many times when I was leader I insisted on the rights of the minority on that side of the aisle. I said that there may come a time when we Democrats would be in the minority. I say that to the majority today. You have been in the minority. There may come a time when you will again be in the minority. 
   We must be respectful of the constitutional rights of Senators who represent the States and the people. We must be respectful of those rights. If it takes longer--if it takes longer than three days or a week to do the work--then let's do the work. That is why we are sent here. 
   But we should not forget the reason for the Senate's being. I came from the House of Representatives. I never wanted this body to become another House of Representatives. The Senate is unique in that respect, and we must not give away the uniqueness of this body. This is not a second House of Representatives. We ought to understand that. The Constitution made the Senate different from the other body, and we ought to do our utmost to keep this as an institution where debate is unlimited and where Senators have the right to offer non-germane amendments. 
   I don't enter into these bickerings and these discussions very often. I am no longer in the elected leadership. Senators do not hear me saying these things often. But I have always been interested in the Senate as an institution. If the Senate is not the institution that it was meant to be, whose fault is it? The people who make up the Senate--it is our fault. 
   I wanted to speak out on this. I am not interested in who wins on every political battle that is fought here. I am not interested from a party standpoint always. Party isn't all that important to me. But I am interested in the Senate. I want it to remain the institution that it was meant to be. 
   I wish we would get away from the idea that we ought to make this a more efficient institution. The Senate was not meant to be efficient. The institution was meant to be a debating forum where ideas would be expressed, and through the medium of debate the right consensus would be hammered out on the anvil.  
   I hear it said: Well, if there are too many amendments, the bill will be taken down. I would suggest that if we want to stop so many legislative amendments from being offered to appropriations bills, then let's call up some of the legislative bills. Let's call up authorization bills. 
   When I was the majority leader, there were times we had to authorize legislation on appropriations bills because the authorizing committees sometimes did not do their work. 
   For example, there were years when we had to reauthorize State Department legislation on appropriations bills, because the authorizing committee simply did not do its work. But if bills reported from legislative committees are not called up in the Senate, Senators who are interested in amendments to such legislation do not have the opportunity to offer their amendments. Consequently, when appropriations bills are called up, Senators will offer legislation on appropriations bills, because it is their only opportunity. They have no other opportunity, no other legislative vehicle on which to call their amendments up, so they are forced to offer their legislative amendments to appropriations bills. That is why we have the problem with appropriations bills that we are having. 
   Another problem we are having when we go to conference with the other body is that major legislation that has not been before either body is added in conference. We talk about the upper House and the lower House. There is a Third House. The conference committee has become a Third House, where hundreds of millions of dollars, even billions of dollars and major legislation are added in conference and come back to each body in a conference report. We have no opportunity to amend that conference report. Authorizing measures are added in conference that have not been before either body. They are stuck in, in conference--in the ``Third House,'' as I want to name it. 
   Another flaw in that operation is that it gives the executive branch too much power, in some instances all power, because, as we saw last year when it got down to the conferences on the final appropriations bills, eight appropriations bills were wrapped into the conference report, one I believe a supplemental, and tax legislation all in that conference report. These items had not been properly taken up before either body. 
   And, as a result, who sat in? Who made the decisions in conference? The decisions in conference for the more important legislation were made by the Speaker of the House, the majority leader of the Senate--both of whom were Republican--and the President's agents. 
   Who represented the Democrats in the conference? The executive branch. We Senate and House Democrats weren't represented in those higher echelons. We were left out. The Democratic minority in the House and Senate was not represented in the conference. It was the Republican leadership of both Houses and the President of the United States, through his OMB Director. 
   That is not the way it is supposed to be. That galls me, to think that in appropriations matters of that kind the executive branch calls the shots in many instances and we House and Senate Democrats are not even represented. The Democrats in the Senate, the Democrats in the House, are left out. That is not the way it ought to be. But that is the result of our delaying action on separate appropriations bills. Then they are all put into an omnibus bill. At the end, we vote on that bill without knowing what is in it. How many hundreds of millions, how many billions of dollars may have been added in conference? And we vote on the conference report when we really do not know what is in it. That galls me. 
   I think we ought to reinstitute rule XXVIII. I voted to uphold the Chair when rule XVI was changed here, and when the Senate overruled the Chair, I voted to uphold the Chair. I favor the reinstitution of rule XVI. But because of the muzzling of the minority, because the minority is not allowed to offer as many amendments as we need to offer, I am going to uphold the Chair's position today.

   Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. 
   I am not going to vote to go back to rule XVI. I want to go back. I do not like the vote I am going to cast. But how else am I going to protest? 
   I think the minority should have the opportunity to offer its amendments, and not jerk a bill down just because amendments are coming in from the minority side. 
   Another thing: There is no rule of, as I say, germaneness or relevancy in the Senate. When we call up bills, except for the two instances which I referred to there, cloture and on appropriations bills under rule XVI, there is no rule of relevancy to say: Cut down your amendments; we will give you 5 amendments or 10 amendments and they have to be relevant. Who said they have to be relevant? The rules of the Senate don't say they have to be relevant. But if an appropriation bill is the only vehicle you are ever going to have on which to try to take a shot at 
   something that is not relevant, you have to take it. And the minority is being robbed of that opportunity. The minority is being placed under the gag rule. It is being laid down here: You will do it our way or we will jerk the bill down. You have to do it our way. You have to limit your amendments to 5 or 6 or 8 or 10--no more. That is not in this Senate rule book. That is not in this Constitution. And it is not in the best interests of the American people that the Senate is being run that way. 
   Personally, I have a very high regard for the leadership on the other side, for the individuals themselves. I have a high regard for Senators on the other side of the aisle. Some of the finest Senators I know sit on that side of the aisle. Some of the most knowledgeable Senators I know are on that side of the aisle. Some of the smartest Senators are on that side of the aisle. 
   But, Mr. President, I am talking about the Senate as an institution, and I do not want and I do not intend to see us run over continually and denied the opportunity to offer amendments, and to debate, without a shot being fired. 
   I stacked the legislative tree very few times when I was leader. But very few times did I resort to that. My rule was one of the basic reasons for the Senate to let the minority have their rights, because as long as the minority have their rights in this forum, the people's liberties will not be taken from them. I want the minority to be given their rights. 
   Mr. President, I am going to close with the words of Aaron Burr, who spoke to the Senate in 1805, on March 5, after presiding over the Senate for 4 years. He said:  
   This House is a sanctuary; a citadel of law, of order, and of liberty; and it is here--it is here, in this exalted refuge; here, if anywhere, will resistance be made to the storms of political phrensy and the silent arts of corruption; and if the Constitution be destined ever to perish by the sacrilegious hands of the demagogue or the usurper, which God avert, its expiring agonies will be witnessed on this floor.  
   Mr. President, I think we are seeing something akin to its expiring agonies because the Senate is not being allowed to fulfill its purposes for being. It is not being allowed to work its will. The people are being denied. It is not just the Democrats at this moment who are being denied, it is the people who are being denied the right of the minority in this Senate to speak their wills, to offer their amendments, to fully debate the legislation that is in the interests of the people. 
   In the interest of the people, I urge the leadership, I implore the leadership to stop thinking so much, as apparently it does, in terms of who will win today--``we have to win on this one.'' Let's think of the people. Protect the rights of the minority, allow full freedom to debate and amend, and the people's rights and the people's liberties will be secured.

   Mr. BYRD. The answer to that is, call up authorization bills. Let Members on this side offer their nongermane amendments to them. Then come to the appropriations bills, and the Senators on this side will have already had their chance. Call the legislative bills up. Why not have those bills called up? What are we afraid of? 
   The numbers are on that side of the aisle. As I said to the distinguished majority leader on one occasion: You have the numbers; you have the votes. Why not let the Democrats call up their amendments? You can beat them. You can reject them. You can table them. But if you do not have the votes to defeat them, perhaps that amendment is in the best interest of the country. And the Senate will have worked its will. 
   May I close by saying this--and I thank you for giving me this privilege--reference has been made to the time when I was majority leader, very graciously by the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, because he stated it was not done during my tenure of leadership while he has been here. But over one-third of the Senate today--over one-third of today's Senators--were not here when I was majority leader of the Senate. 
   I walked away from that position at the end of 1988 and became chairman of the Appropriations Committee in January 1989. More than one-third of the Senators were not here when I was majority leader. Even the distinguished majority leader, Mr. LOTT, was not in this body when I was majority leader. 
   But when I was majority leader, I say again, I attempted to protect the rights of the minority because I saw that as one of the reasons for the Senate's being. 
   I thank both Senators. Both Senators have been very kind to me and very courteous. I think very highly of them both. I respect their viewpoints.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, having been majority leader in the 95th and the 96th and again in the 100th Congress, I want to assure the distinguished majority leader that I have experienced all of his troubles, all of his problems. And this business of having to deal with a filibuster on a motion to proceed is nothing new around here. That has been the case for decades. So the distinguished majority leader is not experiencing something that I did not experience or that other leaders did not experience. 
   The motion to proceed to the civil rights bill of 1964 was debated 2 weeks. That was just the motion to proceed. And the bill itself was before the Senate 77 days. It was actually debated 57 days, including 6 Saturdays. All in all, including the time that it took to get up the motion to proceed, and the time to deal with the bill itself, and then including, I believe it was, 9 days following cloture before the vote on passage occurred on the bill, it took 103 days--103 calendar days--to deal with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
   I was the only non-Southern Democrat--the only non-Southern Democrat--to vote against that bill. And I was against cloture on it. Other than Senator Hayden and Senator Bible, I was the only non-Southern Democrat to vote against cloture. So I have been through all these travails and trials that the majority leader has experienced. And I empathize with him and sympathize with him, because I have been there, too. But it is nothing new to be confronted with a possible filibuster on a motion to proceed. I had to deal with that many times.

   Mr. BYRD. I do not do that often. But Senators do have the right to offer amendments. The distinguished majority leader has his problems. I know them. I know them well. I sympathize with him and want to work with him and want to help him. 
   I call attention to the fact that there are 63 Senators in this body who never served in this body when I was majority leader--63. I said this morning that more than a third, but it was actually almost two-thirds of the Members of this body were not here when I was majority leader. 
   I was glad to hear the Senator quote Shakespeare. Let me quote from Shakespeare also: 
 'Tis in my memory lock'd And you yourself shall keep the key of it.  
   So, Mr. President, I certainly will always want to cooperate with the distinguished leader when I can. I have to say I think there is too much partisanship in this Senate, on both sides, far more partisanship in the Senate than there was when I came here. I would urge again that the distinguished Majority Leader let Democrats call up amendments and that he call up legislative bills, and thereby give Senators a chance to call up their amendments so that they will not have to resort to offering them on appropriations bills.

   Mr. BYRD. The majority leader was not on the floor earlier when I said that as the majority leader, I resorted to filling the tree a few times. So what the distinguished majority leader said doesn't reveal anything that is new and doesn't really reveal anything that I haven't myself already said today. I did that. I may have been the first one to fill up the tree in my service in the Senate--I am not sure--but I did do that on a few occasions, but only on a very few occasions. I didn't make it a practice. 
   I also compliment the majority leader, and have done so on several occasions, for his judicious and very fair handling of the impeachment trial. I think the Senate did itself honor and did well by virtue of the fact that both leaders put the welfare of the Senate and the welfare of the country ahead of political party. I complimented the majority leader at that time, and I do again. He demonstrated real statesmanship on that occasion. 
   Let me just say, again, what I said earlier this morning about political party. It is important to me, but I have never felt that political party is the most important thing. The Senate is more important than any political party. Many things are more important than political party. I have said that. But during my tenure as the majority leader, I always tried to protect the rights of the minority. Many times I made a point of it. I tried to protect the rights of the minority because that is a great part of what this forum is all about, protection of minority rights. 
   I can also say that Senator STEVENS and I did work together to come up  with some proposals that would have improved our situation, I think. We came up with a resolution containing several rules changes, with the understanding of the distinguished majority leader and with his full knowledge. I wanted it to be called up and debated and acted upon, but it is still in the Rules Committee. Nothing has ever been done about it. 
   Our concern, going back to rule XVI, is this: Under the earlier operation of Rule XVI, a point of order could be made against legislation on an appropriations bill. If the question of germaneness was raised, the matter was submitted to the Senate for an immediate vote. The Senate voted on it. If the Senate decided on that vote that the House had already opened the door to legislation on an appropriations bill, the Senate certainly had a right to respond by further amendment. 
   The problem now is, we are calling up appropriations bills that come out of the Senate Appropriations Committee. They are Senate appropriations bills. No point of order can be made that they constitute legislation on appropriations bills. There is no question of germaneness. If we go back to rule XVI, unless we take up the House appropriations bills, we cannot make the point of germaneness against a Senate appropriations bill. That is our problem. 
   Senators right now, myself included, who voted to uphold the Chair on that occasion and stay with rule XVI, are concerned about going back to it now because we are normally acting on Senate appropriations bills, not House Appropriations bills. I have to applaud Senator STEVENS. He is one of the best Appropriations Committee chairmen I have served with, and he seeks to take advantage of the time and get something done. We have Senate hearings and we mark up regular appropriations bills and then we act on them on the floor. When the House bill comes over to the Senate we substitute the text of the Senate bill in lieu of the House bill. That is all well and good. It saves time. But it does away with the opportunity to raise the question of germaneness. The question of germaneness cannot be raised unless we bring the House Appropriations bill up and the House has previously opened the door to legislation. 
   I hate to vote against going back to rule XVI; I would like to go back to it.

   Mr. BYRD. I have always been a majority leader willing to hear the other man respond. He mentioned two or three bills, and those are good examples of the work the Senate can do when it is given the opportunity to offer amendments and take time on the bill. I hope that we do more of that. 
   My reason for voting, as I will later today, against going back to that rule is two or threefold. One is, the majority who had the votes then overturned the rule. The majority, which has the votes now, will reinstitute it. In the future, I am wondering if the situation will arise when it will be to the majority's benefit again and it will use its vote to overturn the rule again. But the reason I will vote against it today is because Senators on this side, according to my observations--and I don't make much of a big to-do often here--but Senators on this side of the aisle are simply not given the right to act on legislative bills much of the time, so they have no other resort but the appropriations bills. Therefore, I think I have to vote against reinstituting the rule.

   Mr. BYRD. I certainly don't want to appear to be trying to take anything away from the distinguished majority leader, who has accomplished many things. I compliment him, and I have done so many times. I have spoken behind his back as well as to his face that he has many attributes that I admire. But surely the distinguished majority leader didn't mean what he said when he said the Democrats were trying to dictate the scheduling. This Democrat doesn't do that, and the majority leader knows that. This Democrat has no such intention, and I don't think the Democrats here, who are in the minority, would attempt to try to dictate the schedule. 
   The Democrats, as I observe them, are trying to stand up for their rights, and they certainly have the right to debate and the right to offer amendments. I have no interest in taking over the schedule here. But I do have an interest in the Senate. I think the Senate has gone downhill. I think it is too partisan, and I don't think the minority has been given the right to call up amendments. I have seen the distinguished majority leader call up a bill and immediately put a cloture motion on it. I have done that a few times, too, my friend, but I never made it a practice to do it day after day and time after time. You can search my record if you want to, but I also have a memory. I was majority leader here, as I say, before 63 of the current Senators, including the majority leader, got here. I am pretty well informed about what has gone on before. 
   I am not here to attack the majority leader today. I admire him. I count him as my friend. As far as I am concerned, he will remain that way. 
   But I think the Senate is being hurt. I don't want the Senate to be hurt. I think the American people want their work done. 
   I had the same problem that the Senator is talking about. I called our Democratic Senators one day into my office, and I said: Now, I'll tell you what I am going to do. We are going to have a week's or ten-day break every 4 weeks here. We are going to go home and talk to our people. 
   I got a big hand of applause. 
   Then I said: Now, the other side of that coin is, we are going to be here 5 days a week, and we are going to work 5 days a week. And we are going to have votes 5 days a week, on Mondays as well as on Fridays. 
   I first offered the carrot, and then I offered the stick, and it worked. 
   I am the one--I am the culprit--who started this business of having breaks every 4 or 5 weeks. But I also kept the Senate here. Not everybody on this side of the aisle liked me for it. As I said, it is not the quality of life around here that counts to me; as long as I am the majority leader, it is the quality of work that counts. 
   I have been through all of that. We got the work done. Senators were able to call up their amendments. They were able to get votes on them. Look at the Record of the 100th Congress. You will see a good record.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the small, serious, tousled-hair lad seemed, even at the tender age of 3, to know just the right thing to do. With a straight back and a smart, entirely proper, military salute, John F. Kennedy, Jr. expressed the grief of an entire nation with a dignity far beyond his years. He was only 3, yet he gave the Nation a lasting, memorable, indelible image, an image that is remembered by millions and captured on videotape for generations to come. 
   Now John F. Kennedy, Jr. has, himself, been lost at an age far too young for easy acceptance by a country which had affectionately watched him grow to manhood. His untimely death feels as heavy and oppressive as the too hot, too dry summer in which he lived his final days. 
   Words fail to express the special deprivation that the human spirit feels when the young, the beautiful, the handsome, the vital among us are suddenly taken from our midst before they have fulfilled their potential promise. Especially, in this case, the mind reels at the spectre of yet another Kennedy, taken too soon, yet another unbearable sorrow for this family which has had so much sorrow to bear. Yet this incredible American family will undoubtedly once again demonstrate to the Nation that they will endure, and that it is how one lives, and not how one dies, that ultimately matters. 
   John Kennedy, Jr., his wife, Carolyn, and his sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette have vanished in the summer night in the springtime of their years, and our hearts go out to the Bessette and the Kennedy families. I am particularly saddened for my good friend, Senator TED KENNEDY. He is a great Senator. He is a great figure on the American political stage. I know that his heart must be broken by this latest family tragedy, yet I am confident that his expansive spirit and his deep faith in God will see him safely to a harbor of peace and of comfort. 
   My wife, Erma, and I offer our prayers and our deepest sympathies to him and to the families at this saddest of sad times.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, farmers across America are experiencing hard times. This year, the difficulties of farmers in the northeast and central-Atlantic regions of America have been made worse by a serious lack of rainfall for many, many weeks. 
   West Virginia's farmers have been especially hard hit by the drought of 1999. No significant rainfall has drenched the scorched earth in my State since May 15. On May 28 the Governor of West Virginia declared an Agricultural State of Emergency for West Virginia. At that time, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's State Emergency Board for West Virginia concurred with that decision. Now farmers await a decision by the U.S. Department of Agriculture that would permit much needed federal emergency assistance funds to be dispensed. 
   We know that here in Washington, in northern Virginia, in the Maryland suburbs, and on the farms nearby, the ground is dry. We can look out our windows and see that where there was once soft green grass growing, there is now a crispy, lifeless carpet of beige. Where there is no grass, cracked, dusty earth remains. I know that my tomato plants have needed extra watering to keep them growing up their stakes, but these are merely part of my backyard small garden that I sow for pleasure. My life will not drastically change if I fail to bring in a tomato crop. That is not true for those whose livelihood depends upon it. 
   Close your eyes and take a moment to imagine this: you have been looking to the sky for two months praying that the clouds will release a downpour, but no drops fall. Your corn plants that should be up to your shoulder by the fourth of July in a normal season, remain below your knees. They are short stems shriveling slowly on acres and acres of parched land. You have moved your herd to your last pasture. In a short period of time the animals have grazed it over so thoroughly that nothing remains but unpalatable dried-out grass stubble. Your pastures have been grazed over so thoroughly that you are now, during the middle of the summer, when lengthy pasture grasses should blow in the gentle summer breeze, and naturally produced resources should be plentiful, feeding your animals with purchased hay and grain as though it were the desolate season of winter. Even though they are being fed enough to gain weight, the extreme heat is causing them so much stress that they are losing weight. It is impossible to keep them cool and comfortable. The pond on your farm that you use as a source of water for your animals is slowly, slowly becoming a puddle. The stream that runs through the far end of your property first became a muddy trickle, but now is becoming dusty and cracked. When you turn on the tap, try to flush your commode, or bathe, no water flows. You instead must travel every day to a truck parked in the middle of your town to get a couple of gallons of water for you and your family to drink. Even if it rains today or tomorrow, you begin to wonder if it will make any difference to you. You have fallen on hard times before as an Appalachian farmer. Times are often lean in that region. Now, in desperation, you begin to think about what you could do if you were not a family farmer. 
   This is a very real situation for the farmers in West Virginia and in many areas of the country. The most serious impact of the drought on farmers is having to purchase feed for their animals. Under normal conditions, there are regions in West Virginia where farmers can grow two or three cuttings of hay in a year. They use this hay to feed their animals. 
   Last year's cuttings were thin, and this year's have been even thinner, with farmers barely being able to make one cutting! So, as I mentioned earlier, the farmers have begun to purchase feed. This does not bode well for the winter, either, as farmers will have to rely on purchasing expensive hay and grain brought in from outside the drought areas, or face the prospect of selling off their underweight stock for little or no profit or at a loss. Farmers will not be able to afford to keep feeding their animals in this way. West Virginia's farmers fear that they may lose their farms--not just lose their crop, lose their farms--if they must wait until next spring to receive U.S. Department of Agriculture assistance, which is how long it would take for the funds we appropriate to reach them if appropriations are completed on time, as I hope they will be. West Virginia farmers need Federal assistance now. 
   And the same can be said for Maryland farmers and Virginia farmers and others. Nearly $2.9 million in Federal emergency aid for energy assistance was released through the Department of Housing and Urban Development Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program on Monday, July 12. Hopefully our farmers who have been having a difficult time keeping their animals cool will be allowed a portion of these funds. However, this is a tiny drop of water in a very empty State bucket where it is estimated that the drought has caused $50 million in damages. 
   Regulations allow farmers to become eligible for emergency assistance when they have suffered at least a 30-percent loss of normal production in a single enterprise. In West Virginia, which is not a large State and certainly not a large farming State, according to the most recent statistics available, which were calculated in the middle of June, in all but 3 counties 40 to 50 percent of grass hay production has been lost for this year. It has been lost. In 17 West Virginia counties, 35 percent of corn production has already been lost--already been lost; 40 percent of tobacco has been lost; 50 percent of pasture--50 percent of pasture has been lost. A dozen other counties have experienced at least a 10- to 20-percent loss of corn, tobacco, and tobacco crops; a 30- to 50-percent loss of pasture; and a 20- to 40-percent loss of their truck crops, such as apples and peaches, grown for table consumption. Twenty-three other counties have lost 10- to 30-percent of their alfalfa hay, 40- to 50-percent of their pasture, 10- to 30-percent of their corn, and 25- to 30-percent of other grains. 
   So I remind those listening and those who are watching through the electronic cameras that these statistics are  from the middle of June. Now, weeks later, after a continued period of scorching temperatures, and arid conditions, it is expected that a statistical report that will be generated later this week will show significant losses occurring in every one of the 55 counties of the great State of West Virginia. 
   The Federal Government has established mechanisms that are intended to aid Americans in times of crisis. However, when these mechanisms are slow to work, difficulties have a tendency to grow, and greater assistance becomes necessary. As we have often heard, ``One stitch, in time, saves nine.'' In the case of farmers, if nothing is done, and the farmer is forced to abandon the land that he has worked, it is likely that this land will not be reclaimed next year or the year after as a family farm. A farm is not a machine that can be shut down temporarily until someone is ready to work on it again or conditions make it profitable. Farming is, by its very nature, a cyclical industry that every now and then needs the support of the Federal Government. 
   America can never afford to not help its farmers. Now is the time to help farmers and I speak particularly of West Virginia farmers, of course. If we fail to help them now, they will not be able to survive. Farmers are losing out on every side of their industry. Prices have been, and continue to be, low, the weather is slowing or eliminating crop production, crop insurance payback is so low that it may not even cover costs, and springs and farm ponds are drying up. There are no resources left from which to draw. 
   Farmers have always been an essential part of the fabric that makes America great. ``God made the country but man made the town.'' And from the country is where America gets much or most of its sustenance--not just America but also the world, many nations in the world. 
   We cannot forget these farmers. We cannot forget them now like a child forgets a once-treasured security blanket that has become worn and he has now outgrown. Therefore, I am urging that West Virginia be granted Federal disaster area status so that farmers will receive immediate Federal assistance that will enable them to continue to work their land and raise their animals. 
   I have talked with the Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. Glickman, and he has indicated that as soon as he is supplied with the sufficient data from the State, adequate and careful and prompt consideration will be given. But I have to say that time waits for no one and the clock waits for no one and the farmers' problems cannot wait. We must have help. We need it and the sooner the better. 
   Mr. President, I thank the Senate and I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on July 16, the Robert J. Dole Institute for Public Service and Public Policy at the University of Kansas hosted a discussion of civility and deliberation in the United States Senate. 
   Long subjects of interest to me, I was heartened to learn of this event. In an age of media and money-driven politics, it is important to remember that what we Senators must truly strive to be about has little to do with either the media or money. Discussions such as this one remind us all of the essential nature of this body in which we are so privileged to serve, and of the responsibility each of us bears to help this great institution, the United States Senate, continue to reflect the Framers' intent.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this week a delegation of British Members of Parliament will visit the Senate in the latest in a long line of biennial exchanges fostered by the British-American Parliamentary Group. My good and true and long-time friend, Senator STEVENS, and I serve as co-chairs for the American delegation. These exchanges date back to the aftermath of World War II, when both sides recognized the value of maintaining the kind of close working relationship that can only be realized through personal interaction and camaraderie. After graciously hosting Senator STEVENS and me in 1997, when we visited London and York with several other Senators, Lord Jopling later this week will arrive in Washington with Members from the House of Lords and the House of Commons. Lord Michael Jopling is a former Member of  the House of Commons. This weekend, I am pleased that the group will be meeting at the famous Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, to discuss defense, trade, and environmental issues of concern to our great nations. 
   As an avid student of history, particularly Roman and Greek history, Persian history, English history, and American history, I remind all who will listen that those roots are essential in understanding the development of the American Constitution. In the Senate chamber, and while walking through the halls of our columned Capitol building, I am daily reminded of the unique and enduring legacy bequeathed to Americans by our English, Scot, Welsh, and Irish ancestors. The Minton tiles paving the corridors as well as the very language of debate which rings across the Senate floor in sonorous spoken cadences recall this powerful legacy. Even the physical being of the Capitol building itself--its white marble and sunny sandstone gleaming amid graceful stands of stately trees and curving drives--owes a nod of thanks to informal and inviting landscaping design pioneered in Britain. 
   And, less visible but more pervasive, the strong skeleton of government and law in the United States carries the indelible genetic markers of British origin--its DNA shaped by centuries of struggle between monarchs and parliaments before mutating into a new form under the guidance of the British citizens that became our Founding Fathers. Though certainly not an exact clone, like Dolly the sheep, the American bicameral legislature and our legal system based upon British Common Law bear witness to this sturdy inheritance. 
   From the defining moment at Runnymede in 1215, when the English barons forced King John to give his assent to a charter of liberties, the belief in fundamental written guarantees of rights and privileges has become a treasured inheritance on both sides of the Atlantic. Unknown or unpracticed in many parts of the world, the concept of individual rights guaranteed by law is a jewel in the crown of British history. Other documents written since the Magna Carta, and comprising the unwritten English Constitution, including the Petition of Right, 1628, and the English Bill of Rights, 1689, have also found new life on distant shores in the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. And the concepts of ``habeas corpus,'' presentment and trial juries, ``just compensation,'' and the right against self-incrimination, all pillars of American jurisprudence, migrated to the United States from England and English law. 
   To my mind, however, one of the greatest legacies bestowed upon the United States by these generations of British lawmakers is in establishing control over the power of the purse in elected officials of the people, rather than in the executive. Seven hundred and two years ago, in 1297, Edward I reluctantly agreed to the ``Confirmation of the Charters,'' promising not to levy taxes without the common consent of the realm. 
   Parliament took on its original form during the reign of Edward I, 
   who has been called the father of Parliament. Parliament divided into the House of Commons and the House of Lords along about 1339, 1341-42, during the reign of Edward III, who reigned from 1327 to 1377, a total of 50 years. 
   Paired with this spending authority came the right to audit how funds had been expended. These powers of appropriation and audit, the fraternal twins of legislative might, shaped and tested by British experience, were united by the American Founding Fathers in a single paragraph of article I, section 9, of the U.S. Constitution. It states that, ``No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time.'' And so it is this sentence, together with the very first section of article 1, which invests in the Senate and the House of Representatives their broad scope to check the power of the Chief Executive and defend the interests of their various constituencies. 
   For this, as in so many things, I give thanks to my English forbearers, who shed their blood at the point of the sword in wresting from tyrannical monarchs the control of the power over the purse. That struggle lasted for hundreds of years, until finally, in 1689, under the English Bill of Rights, it was guaranteed. As for William of Orange and Mary, who assumed the joint rule over the British people, Parliament required that they accede to and agree to the Declaration of Rights, which had been drawn up in February of 1689. Once they agreed, then they were crowned joint monarchs. In December of that year, the English Declaration of Rights was put into statute form and designated the English Bill of Rights. 
   This is a pearl beyond price, and one which I hope to pass down unblemished to my descendants. Never again, after that English Bill of Rights had been put into statute form, would Kings levy taxes--excise or other taxes--upon the British people without the approval, the assent and consent of Parliament. I have fought with every ounce of energy that I could muster against such mutations of the legacy passed down to this country through a thousand years of blood and English history as the constitutional amendment to balance the budget and the line-item veto. 
   Our common past has built a history of cooperation between the British and the American people that has always prevailed over our differences. In this century, our sons, brothers, and fathers have stood shoulder to shoulder against common enemies from the battlegrounds of world wars to conflicts in the Persian Gulf and in the Balkans. Together, we have stood against the Soviet bear. We have stood fast through changes of governments and shifts in political power. While not always smooth, just as relations between family members are not always smooth, Anglo-American relations have weathered bigger storms than Bosnia, Kosovo, NATO expansion, and differences in how to approach the problem of global climate change. 
   Our blood ties are stronger than the vast and deep ocean of waters that are between us. And those unbreakable bonds will see us through to the next century and beyond, because we are brothers made so through the parenthood of historical experience. Exchanges like those fostered by the British-American Parliamentary Group are the nectar, the ambrosia, that sweetens and sustains the close ties between our nations. I look forward to this week's opportunity to join again at the flower of good fellowship. 
   I second the words of Winston Churchill, who said in a speech in the House of Commons on August 20, 1940:  
   The British Empire and the United States will have to be somewhat mixed up together in some of their affairs for the mutual and general advantage. For my own part looking out upon the future, I do not view the process with any misgivings. I could not stop it if I wished; no one can stop it. Like the Mississippi, it just keeps rolling along. Let it roll, let it roll on full flood, inexorable, irresistible, benignant, to broader lands and better days.  
   Senator STEVENS, our other colleagues who have agreed to join with us at the Greenbrier, and my wife Erma and I welcome Lord and Lady Jopling. My wife and I were in England--in York, as a matter of fact--in August of the year before last, on the day that Princess Diana was killed, and on which we returned to the United States after meeting with the British-U.S. Parliamentary Group. I had the pleasure of chairing the group when we Democrats were in control of the Senate. On that occasion, I took the members of the British group down to the Greenbrier, in Greenbrier County at White Sulphur Springs. We enjoyed it. We all look forward to going there again. 
   Again, I welcome Lord and Lady Jopling, and the British members of this year's exchange. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. 
   For months now, I and many of my colleagues, including the very distinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. SPECTER, have been alerting this Congress to the devastating nature of the steel import crisis that has plagued this Nation since the end of 1997. 
   A year and a half later, in yesterday's Wheeling Intelligencer headlines, we see the statement: ``Sixth Steelmaker Claims Bankruptcy.'' Let me repeat that headline from the Wheeling, WV, newspaper: a sixth U.S. steel mill has declared bankruptcy. 
   With that announcement, U.S. steelworkers in West Virginia, and elsewhere, are wondering when the Clinton administration and this Congress will realize that enough is enough. I have no doubt that the 1,800 people who are employed at Gulf States Steel, Inc., in Gadsden, AL--the sixth U.S. steel mill to declare bankruptcy since the steel import crisis began--are also wondering why no one is acting on a long-term basis to prevent the illegal steel dumping that has jeopardized their jobs. 
   I say enough is enough. Six companies declare bankruptcy, more than 6,200 jobs are jeopardized, and this Administration and this Congress still fail to act: 
   1,800 jobs in Gadsden, Alabama; 
   200 jobs in Alton, Illinois; 
   140 jobs in Holsapple, Pennsylvania; 
   2,400 jobs in Vineyard, Utah; and 
   540 jobs in Washington, Pennsylvania, and Massillon, Ohio. 
   For those who believe that the steel industry is not in difficulty, tell it to these families. Tell it to those workers who have lost their jobs. These men and women and their families are the human faces of the steel crisis. 
   They are not just numbers. They are not just statistics. These are real faces. These are real men and women. These are real children of the steel crisis. 
   While we do nothing, the list of the victims of the steel import crisis grows ever longer. I hear from U.S. steelworkers. They want to know how many more bankruptcies it will take to make the President of the United States and the Congress understand that immediate action must be taken against the tide of cheap and illegal steel imports into this country. How many more U.S. jobs must be lost before we tell our trading partners that enough is enough? 
   We already know that there will be no quota bill passed by this Congress. The House passed a quota bill. The Senate has not passed a quota bill and will not pass a quota bill. Penalties are not likely against Brazil and Russia, even though the Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission found them to be guilty of dumping steel illegally on American shores. Instead of finding a long-term, global solution, this administration chooses to promote piecemeal solutions and negotiate suspension agreements with those two countries. Changes in U.S. trade laws to strengthen enforcement seem even more unlikely. 
   According to the Wheeling, WV, Intelligencer, the U.S. steel industry is still holding on to the thin hope that the steel loan guarantee program, which the Senate has already approved twice, will quickly, hopefully, be approved in the House of Representatives. While this is only a short-term program to help U.S. steel mills that have been hurt by the steel import crisis, I thank my colleagues for passing the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program, authored by me, and a similar program, the Emergency Oil and Gas Guaranteed Loan Program, authored by Senator DOMENICI. 
   On June 21, the Senate requested a conference with the House on H.R. 1664, which contains the steel loan guarantee and the oil and gas loan guarantee, and conferees have been appointed by the Senate. I am hopeful that this conference will take place soon, and we have every right to expect that that conference will take place soon. 
   There was a commitment entered into not too long ago, at the time the emergency supplemental appropriations bill was in conference between the two Houses. A commitment was entered into by the leadership of both the House and Senate to call up the bill in the Senate. That was done. The majority leader of the Senate and the minority leader kept their commitments. The bill was called up in the Senate, and the steel loan guarantee program and the oil and gas loan guarantee program were passed by the Senate for the second time and sent to the House. It is to be expected that a conference will take place, as the Senate has requested. Hopefully, that conference will then meet and act, and act quickly, and hopefully, further, both Houses will quickly adopt a conference report and send it on to the President for his signature. 
   Illegal steel dumping has created exigent circumstances for the U.S. steel industry, and the loan guarantees will provide help to companies, small and middle-sized steel companies that employ thousands of hard-working Americans. These loan guarantees would work through the private market, help to sustain good-paying jobs, support our national security, and save taxpayers millions of dollars from lost tax revenues and increased public assistance payments for things such as 
   unemployment compensation, food stamps, and worker retraining. 
   The fate of the loan programs rests today in the hands of the U.S. House of Representatives. With great respect, I urge the House to act quickly. On behalf of U.S. steel mills and U.S. steelworkers, for those 1,800 steelworkers at great risk with Gulf States Steel in Alabama, for the thousands of other steelworkers and their families across the country who cry out for help, I urge the other body to take action and to support the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will vote against the Republican alternative to the Patients' Bill of Rights. All week long, I have supported amendments that would have strengthened the Republican bill and would have provided all privately insured Americans with meaningful patient protections. At each step along the way, the Democratic amendments were rejected. 
   There are major deficiencies in the Republican bill. The bill that will be passed by the majority covers only 48 million Americans who receive their coverage through self-funded plans. What about the 113 million that their bill leaves out? Don't those 113 million people deserve protections too? I believe that all 160 million Americans with private insurance deserve basic protections. 
   Another important weakness in the Republican plan, Mr. President, is that it does not provide patients the opportunity to hold their health plans responsible under state law. If a health plan's decisions lead to the injury or death of a patient, the plan should not be shielded from accountability.  
   I regret that the Senate narrowly rejected the Robb amendment, which I cosponsored. This amendment would have provided women with important access to their obstetrician/gynecologist (ob/gyn). The Republican bill does not allow a woman to designate her ob/gyn as her primary care provider. 
   Another major distinction between the bills is who makes medical decisions. Will it be the doctor or the insurance company? Unfortunately, the Republicans rejected our definition of medical necessity. Under our bill, plans could not deny benefits based on the insurance companies' definition of medical necessity instead of the doctors' definition. 
   The Democratic version of managed care reform includes access to clinical trials for patients with life-threatening or serious illnesses. The Republican bill provides access to clinical trials only for those suffering from cancer. In addition, their provision applies solely to 48 million Americans. Their bill leaves too many seriously ill Americans without the hope that experimental therapies through clinical trials provide. 
   I regret that the Senate has squandered this opportunity to enact a true Patients' Bill of Rights and provide important protections to all privately insured Americans. I feel I must vote against this bill that puts health plans' profits ahead of patients' well-being. I hope that we can revisit this issue one day and pass legislation that provides strong patient protections.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is finally considering managed care reform legislation. I believe that the Democratic version of the Patients' Bill of Rights is the right vehicle on which to bring reform to the nation. 
   Our colleague from Virginia, Mr. ROBB, has offered an amendment that highlights an important aspect of managed care that needs to be fine-tuned, and that is women's access to health care. This amendment would allow a woman to designate her obstetrician/gynecologist (ob/gyn) as her primary care provider and to seek care from her ob/gyn without needing to get preauthorization from the plan or from her primary care provider. Even though many women consider their ob/gyn as their regular doctor, a number of plans require women to first see their primary care provider before seeing their ob/gyn. This means that a costly and potentially dangerous level of delay is built into the system for women. This amendment would allow a woman's ob/gyn to refer her to other specialists and order tests without jumping through the additional hoop of visiting the general practitioner. 
   This amendment would also address the care a woman receives when undergoing the traumatic surgery of mastectomy. This provision would leave the decision about how long a woman would stay in the hospital following a mastectomy up to the physician and the woman. Some plans have required that this major surgery be done on an outpatient basis. In other instances, women have been sent home shortly after the procedure with tubes still in their bodies and still feeling the effects of anesthesia. This should not be allowed to happen. Plans should not put concern about costs before the well-being of women. 
   The Republican bill does not provide women with sufficient access to care. Plans would not be required to allow women to choose their ob/gyn as their primary care provider. In addition, the Republican bill would allow health plans to limit women's direct access to her ob/gyn to routine care which could potentially be defined by a plan as one visit a year. In addition, ``drive-through mastectomies'' would not be prevented under their bill. 
    Mr. President, the Robb amendment contains commonsense protections women need and deserve. I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the very distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Mr. LAUTENBERG. I compliment him on the battle he has been waging, and successfully, might I add. I am sorry he has elected not to return to this body. I wish he would change his mind on that score. 
   Let me just say at this point, I am pleased to join Senator LAUTENBERG in offering this amendment to the fiscal year 2000 Treasury and general government appropriations bill. The amendment would require that the Office of National Drug Control Policy's Antidrug Youth Media Campaign include ads regarding illegal underage drinking. It is absurd to me that our federally funded media campaign fails to include the No. 1 drug choice amongst children; namely, alcohol. I do not know how that could escape anyone's attention. I cannot understand why that is not included. 
   Large numbers of young people are drinking. According to the 1997 Monitoring the Future Study conducted by  the University of Michigan, approximately 34 percent of high school seniors, 22 percent of tenth graders, and 8 percent of eighth graders, report being drunk at least once in a given month. 
   Yes, Mr. President, drunk. I know that is a shocking statistic. It is also one that we should not tolerate. Alcohol is a gateway drug. Young people who consume alcohol are more likely to use other drugs. 
   Statistics compiled by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University show that 37.5 percent of young people who have consumed alcohol have used some illicit drug versus only 5 percent of young people who have never consumed alcohol. 
   Early alcohol use results in alcohol problems in life. A report by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism indicates that when young people begin drinking before the age of 15, they are four times more likely to develop alcohol dependence than when drinking begins at age 21. 
   I noted in I believe it was either Roll Call or the Hill earlier this week there was a story about interns who are visiting the ``watering holes''--visiting the watering holes. We all know what that means. These are not watering holes. These are places where these young interns are going to drink some form of alcohol, and many of them will end up getting drunk. 
   Most tragically, alcohol kills. It is deadly. Deadly! It takes the lives of more children than all other drugs put together. Yet, for some reason, this particularly lethal drug is left out of the media campaign. This administration has been leading a great campaign, a great crusade against tobacco, against smoking, and that is all right. That is well and good. But why doesn't the administration put its stamp on a crusade, on a great campaign against alcohol for youngsters? Why doesn't the administration lead in that crusade? 
   Let me repeat a story I have told many times. Russell Conwell, one of the great chautauqua speakers, told the story ``Acres of Diamonds'' 5,000 times. I have not told this story 5,000 times, but I have told it a number of times. 
   In 1951, when I was a member of the West Virginia Senate, I asked the warden of the State penitentiary in Moundsville to let me be a witness to the scheduled execution of a young man by the name of James Hewlett. 
   Under the laws of West Virginia at that time, a certain number of witnesses were required to be at an execution. The warden acceded to my request. 
   Why did I want to witness an execution? I often have the opportunity to speak to young people. I often speak to these pages who are sitting right now on both sides of the aisle looking at me. I speak with them out in the halls. I try to tell them wholesome stories from Tolstoy or from other great authors. I try to give them good stories. I try to teach them good lessons so they will leave here having heard someone--and I am sure there are other Senators who do the same thing--talk with them about values. 
   It was for that reason that I wanted to see this execution. I often speak to young people in 4-H groups, Boy Scout groups, Girl Scout groups, and other groups, and I wanted to be able to tell them something that would help them in later life. 
   I went down and talked with the man who was to be executed. He had hired a cab driver to take him from Huntington, WV, over to Logan. On the way, he pulled a revolver and shot the cab driver in the back, robbed him, dumped him by the side of the road, and left him there to die. 
   Later, Jim Hewlett was apprehended in a theater in Montgomery. He was brought to trial, convicted, and sentenced to die in the electric chair. 
   He was asked if he would like a chaplain in his cell. He scoffed at the idea of having a chaplain in his cell. He did not want any part of it. But when the Governor declined to commute his sentence, then the young man became serious about a chaplain. He wanted a chaplain in his cell. 
   On this occasion, the warden permitted me to go down to the cell of the young man, and I talked with him. I told him I had the opportunity to talk with young people on many occasions, and I asked if he had something that he could tell me that would 
   help these young people, some advice that I could pass on to them that might assist them in avoiding trouble in later life. 
   Jim Hewlett said yes. He said: ``Tell them to go to Sunday school and church.'' He said: ``If I had gone to Sunday school and church, I wouldn't be here tonight.'' 
   Our conversation was very short. The hour of 9 was rapidly approaching, and he was to step into the electric chair at 9 o'clock. As I started to go, after thanking him, he said, ``Wait a minute. Tell them one more thing. Tell them not to drink the stuff that I drank.'' Those are his exact words. I have spoken them hundreds of times: ``Tell them not to drink the stuff that I drank.'' 
   I said: ``What do you mean by that?'' 
   The chaplain spoke up and said: ``Senator''--I was a State senator at that time--``Senator, you see that little crack on the wall up there? If he were to have a couple of drinks, he would try to go through that crack in the wall. That is what it does to him. He was drinking when he shot the cab driver.'' 
   I went back to the warden's office. 
   The rest of the story, of course, is obvious. The young man was executed, and I have been passing these words of Jim Hewlett from Fayette County, WV, on to young people during these almost 50 years since: ``Tell them not to drink the stuff that I drank.'' 
   Why do we have to tippy-toe around it? Why does the administration have to tippy-toe around it? Why do the people in the administration who have responsibilities along this line have to tippy-toe around it? Alcohol kills! Not only does it sometimes kill the person who imbibes but it also kills others--wives, children, old people who are trying to go to the grocery store or to a child-care center. These are people who are innocent. They are not doing the drinking. But the person who drank and then got behind the wheel, that person has killed others. 
   Every year at commencement time, when high schools are holding their commencements all over the country, we read stories in the newspapers. They are the same year after year: a group of youngsters, having just graduated, have a big party, and they get drunk and they crash their automobile that is going at a speed of 100 miles per hour into a tree. The automobile wraps itself around the tree and there are the mangled, bleeding, dead bodies in the twisted wreckage. And in the car is also found some alcohol. 
   It is time this country awakens. It is time the churches of this country awaken and tell our young people: Don't do it. 
   When I give a Christmas message, I do not say: Don't drink and drive. I simply say: Don't drink. I am not expecting everybody to feel as I do or to do as I do, but at least we ought to do what we can to educate the young people of this country as to the evils, the dangers, and the sorrows that will come from the use of alcohol--alcohol. 
   There are some young people right now listening to me on the television somewhere who have heard me pass along the advice of the condemned man, Jim Hewlett: ``Tell them not to drink the stuff that I drank.'' I hope those young people will listen. I hope they will take it to heart and not drink alcohol. 
   This amendment is a commonsense amendment--a commonsense amendment--to address the staggering statistics regarding youth alcohol use. We need to send a strong message to the nation's youth that drinking has serious consequences, and all too often they are deadly consequences. 
   I thank Mr. LAUTENBERG for his statesmanship, for his courage, and for his common sense. I appreciate very much his allowing me to cosponsor this amendment. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. BYRD. I will take a couple of minutes to express my appreciation to the two managers of this bill. I chaired the subcommittee on appropriations for the District of Columbia for 7 years, beginning in 1961 and ending in 1968. 
   This is not just an ordinary city, as we all know. I have traveled in many areas of the world, as have most Senators. I have been in many cities of the world, but this is the only Federal city in the world. This is the only Federal city in the United States. 
   Referring to the words of the Constitution, article I, section 9, it is the seat of the Government of the United States. It is not ``a'' seat of the Government of the United States, it is ``the'' seat of the Government of the United States. 
   So it is a unique city. It is the only city of its kind in this country. It is the only city of its kind in the universe. 
   I compliment these two Senators. It is 20 minutes after 9 o'clock on what will be the last day the Senate will be in session until after next week. These two Senators are here discussing important matters. 
   As I sat here, I thought this bill is one that the Senate should vote on. Senators should be here and should vote on this bill. 
   Next year, all things being equal, it is my intention at the present time to see that we have a vote on this bill, a rollcall vote. I think Senators should indicate that much interest in ``the'' city of the Federal Government of the United States. 
   I happen to agree with the distinguished Senator from Illinois in respect to his comments concerning a tax cut. Senators will not find me supporting very many tax cuts, whether it is for the District of Columbia or elsewhere. I will have plenty to say about that in due time. But every Senator has a right to his own viewpoint. Every Senator is here representing his own State, trying to do the best he can. That is what I am trying to do. But we all have a responsibility toward this city. 
   I referred to the job of the distinguished Senator from Texas, Mrs. HUTCHISON, and the distinguished Senator from Illinois, Mr. DURBIN, as being a thankless task. What did I mean by that? That was not spoken in pejorative terms, it was not in derogation of the District of Columbia, but it is a thankless task insofar as getting any credit from the folks back home is concerned. It doesn't get any Senator any votes back home, if that is what one expects. So in that respect, it is a thankless task. 
   But we all, all 100 Senators and every person in the United States, owe our thanks to the Senators who give of their time to fulfill this responsibility. It is a responsibility; it is a duty. Nobody wants this job. I didn't want it, but I held it for 7 years and gave it my best because I thought that the District of Columbia was entitled to the best of my talents, my energy, and whatever limited wisdom I possessed. So we owe that to the District of Columbia. It is our capital. It is our seat of our Federal Government. 
   So I thank both Senators. They spend a lot of time on this matter, I can tell you, and it is not easy. And they are subject to many criticisms from editorials in papers in the District and from editorials, probably, in their own States. They are subject to these criticisms. In return, as I say, they won't get many thanks. But they get my thanks. I hope to call this to the attention of the Senate, as I am now trying to do, as I am saying to the people of the United States who may be watching at this hour: These two Senators are entitled to the thanks and the congratulations of the people of the United States and the people of the District of Columbia. 
   There are people in the District of Columbia who do not look back with great satisfaction on certain recent years. There is a Delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives. She has the privilege of the floor. She is not sitting in the gallery. The rules say that we cannot call attention to people in the galleries. I hope Senators will read that rule and refresh their memory. I trust the Presiding Officers will keep that in mind in the future and call it to the attention of any Senator who refers to people in the gallery; a person, name those persons. But we can refer to an elected Delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives who has the privilege of this floor. I do that now with respect to Delegate ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON. She is highly respected, highly regarded, and she gives the best of her talents and services to the people of the District of Columbia who elected her. I salute her. 
   Again, I close by thanking the two fine Senators who have labored here and worked so late. I daresay the Senator from Texas would probably be on her way home, home in Texas. And the Senator from Illinois, I am quite sure, would be on his way home in Illinois. But he had a job to do here. He had a responsibility. I salute him, I thank him, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today marks another milestone in the remarkable career of a remarkable man--former Senator James Sasser of Tennessee. Today, after three-and-a-half tumultuous years, Jim Sasser formally relinquishes his post as U.S. Ambassador to the People's Republic of China and prepares to return home. 
   I am told that Henry Kissinger gave a speech in Beijing the other day and called Jim Sasser ``the best Ambassador we have sent to China.'' Having served with Jim for 18 years in the United States Senate, I am not surprised at the accolades he has received for his service as U.S. Ambassador in one of the most difficult and sensitive posts in the world.  
   Jim Sasser is a man of decency, integrity, and honor. Throughout his globe-spanning career, as a lawyer, a United States Senator, and a diplomat, he has never strayed far from his rural west Tennessee roots, where he learned the core values that have guided his actions ever since. In 1989, when I became chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Jim took over the chairmanship of the Senate Budget Committee. Together, we successfully tackled many of the thorny budget and appropriations issues that arose in the early 1990's. I was privileged to work closely with him for many years on the Senate Appropriations Committee, where he served with distinction as Chairman of the Military Construction Subcommittee. 
   It is clear that the hard work, talent, and leadership that he demonstrated throughout his Senate career served Jim well when he took over the post of Ambassador to China in 1996. U.S. relations with that nation have experienced dizzying swings during Jim's tenure, reaching their lowest point when the U.S. embassy in Beijing came under siege during the Kosovo conflict, but Jim has always remained above the fray, earning the respect of U.S. and Chinese officials alike. Few of us who know him can forget the haunting photograph of Jim Sasser standing behind the shattered window of the embassy at the height of the anti-American demonstrations in China just two months ago. 
   Mr. President, four-and-a-half years ago, I stood in this spot to bid Senator Sasser farewell upon his retirement from the Senate. Today, I am pleased to welcome him home to America again. He has served our nation with distinction, and I am confident that he will continue to do so in the coming years wherever the future may lead him.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Republican leader for his willingness to have a session on tomorrow in order that I and other Senators might make speeches which we have not had an opportunity to give during the previous busy days of this week. But I thought it better, if it could be done, that we complete our speeches today and not cause the Senate to have to be in session on tomorrow. 
   I did want to thank the majority leader for his willingness to have the Senate come in. 
   Mr. President, I thank those who have stayed to listen, and may God bless all the Members of this body and all the staff people who work to help us to serve our constituents. May he continue to bless this great country, and may we as Americans never forget that this country has been a favorite in God's masterful design. God bless America. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise to urge a speedy resolution to the conference the House- and Senate-passed versions of H.R. 1554, the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act. I hope that the conferees will meet soon, and that the Congress can take final action on this matter. 
   This is a much needed measure to enhance the satellite television industry's ability to compete with cable television. Currently, cable has a commanding 85 percent share of the multichannel video programming distribution market. Satellite serves only 12.1 percent of the market. The 1988 Satellite Home Viewer Act enacted in 1988 put in place certain impediments to satellite carriers being truly competitive with cable. This measure alleviates those roadblocks and will promote real competition. This is good news for consumers. Prices should come down, and the diversity of programming offered should increase. 
   The Senate version of H.R. 1554 would remove the 90-day waiting period for receipt of broadcast network signals that consumers currently face when switching from cable to satellite television reception. It would authorize satellite carriers to offer local television station broadcasts to their customers. This provision would go a long way toward leveling the playing field between cable and satellite television. One of the major deterrents to purchasing satellite television has been the inability to watch local broadcast programming. The bill also contains a ``must carry'' provision, meaning that all local stations must be carried by the satellite carriers by January 1, 2002. 
   But, Mr. President, the aspect of this legislation that my constituents are most immediately concerned about is their current access to distant network signals through their satellite television systems. As I drive through the mountains of West Virginia, I am awed by their beauty and majesty. West Virginia truly is an amazing state in which to live, sometimes described as ``all ups and downs.'' Flattened out as you would a crumpled piece of paper, a topographic map of West Virginia would move up the ranks from one of the smaller states in the Union to one of the largest. This awe-inspiring geography presents unique challenges to my constituents. One of those challenges is the ability to receive over-the-air broadcast signals. Many of my constituents, through no fault of their own, are having those signals terminated. While they may live in an area that is supposed to get a signal from the local broadcast station, many times geography and other factors result in a picture that is not acceptable. Under current law, if a household should be able to receive broadcast network signals with an antenna, that household is ineligible to receive distant network signals from their satellite provider. This leaves many West Virginians with little recourse. Their street address or zip code indicates that they should be able to receive local stations with a rooftop antenna, but the steep hillsides that form their backyards make that impossible. 
   In an effort to address this issue, under the Senate-passed version of H.R. 1554, customers who were receiving a distant network signal before July 11, 1998, would receive those signals until December 31, 1999. After that date, the affiliate network signals of customers residing within the Grade A contours, the areas closest to the broadcast station, would be cut off. This bill will allow satellite subscribers outside of the grade A contour, but within the grade B contour, to continue to receive their distant network signals after December 31, 1999, subject to an FCC rulemaking. I believe this is a fair way to deal with subscribers who, through no fault of their own, would otherwise have distant network signals terminated. 
   I am a strong supporter of local broadcasters, and I believe that they perform an important function for local communities. The local news and emergency services broadcasters provide are invaluable and should be protected. While I understand the concerns expressed by local broadcasters, I am not convinced that the grandfathering provision included in the Senate bill will constitute significant harm to their livelihoods. 
   I urge the conferees to complete action so that Congress can quickly enact this legislation to provide relief to the many people throughout West Virginia and the Nation. 
   I apologize to all officers, Senators's aides and Members of the staff for the late hour, but I think that is perhaps better than being in session tomorrow.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I take this time to call the attention of our colleagues and our viewing audience to the forthcoming Independence Day, July 4. 
   What is July 4 all about? The Declaration of Independence in U.S. history was a document that proclaimed the freedom of the Thirteen Colonies from British rule. It was the first formal pronouncement by an organized body of people of the right to govern by choice. 
   On July 2, 1776, the Second Continental Congress, meeting in Philadelphia, approved Richard Henry Lee's motion for independence, and on July 4--which later came to be celebrated as Independence Day--it approved the declaration. Signing of the declaration took place over the course of several months, beginning August 2. Ultimately, the signatories numbered 56. 
   The Declaration of Independence, written primarily by Thomas Jefferson, and modeled largely on the theories of John Locke, have affirmed the national rights of man and the doctrine of government by contract, which Congress insisted had been repeatedly violated by King George III.  
   Specific grievances were listed in support of the contention that the Colonies had the right and the duty to revoke. The declaration was paid little attention to at the time, but it proved influential in the 19th century, and in the United States has enjoyed an esteem second only to the Federal Constitution. 
   Mr. President, all across the United States and in U.S. embassies around the world, lawns are being mowed and outdoor furniture is being hosed off as Americans prepare to celebrate our biggest open air holiday, Independence Day. The fireworks stands have been doing brisk business selling everything from smoky uncoiling snakes to dazzling sparklers to rockets and fountains that shriek and pop as they dispense multicolored bursts of flame and sparks. 
   The one great constant in our national lexicon, it seems, is the Fourth of July. With some variations in the side dishes, the core menu reliably consists of juicy hamburgers and crisp-skinned hotdogs slathered in ketchup and mustard, served with creamy potato and macaroni salads, potato chips, onions, sweet corn on the cob dripping with butter, and icy, icy, icy, icy watermelon wedges that provide the ammunition for seed spitting contests. How great it is. 
   Whether eating with friends or family at a picnic site, in one's backyard, or tailgate style, the feasts are followed by games to fill the endless wait until the skies darken and become a fitting backdrop for the big show of the day--the fireworks displays. 
   The sight of fireworks, those great blossoming stars of sparks that burst and then fall like rain from the sky, never fails to remind me of the words of the Star Spangled Banner, written by Francis Scott Key after witnessing the artillery bombardment of Fort McHenry during the War of 1812: ``..... and the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air, gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.......'' Francis Scott Key was being held by the British, having sailed out to their fleet, staged off Baltimore, in an attempt to free a local doctor taken hostage earlier. The British officers did finally agree to free the doctor, but decided that Key and his companions had seen too much to be released before the attack began. 
   The beauty and excitement of the fireworks that many of us will see this weekend, therefore, evoke for me the great battles that were fought to make our Nation free and to defend her from harm in those dangerous early years of the republic. It is when I see fireworks that I most fully appreciate the great risks hazarded by our forefathers when they declared independence from the Crown. They risked everything--their lives, their fortunes, their lands, their families, their sacred honor. 
   I recall Nathan Hale, who responded to the call of George Washington, the commander of the armies at Valley Forge. George Washington wanted someone to volunteer to go behind the British lines and draw pictures of the breastworks and bring them back to him, George Washington. It was a dangerous undertaking. It meant risking one's life. And so Nathan Hale, who was a schoolteacher, volunteered. He went behind the British lines. He succeeded in what he had gone there to do, but the night before he planned to return to the American lines he was discovered and the papers were discovered on him, and the next morning he was brought before the scaffold. The British officer, whose name was Cunningham, and who denied Nathan Hale's last wish, his wish for a Bible, said to him: Have you anything to say? 
   Well, there at the foot of the scaffold, Nathan Hale could see the rough-hewn wooden coffin in which his body would soon lie. He said, ``I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.'' Think of that. ``I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.'' 
   That is the kind of patriot who gave this country its independence, and many of us can't even give our country one vote on election day. What a pitiful example we sometimes set as a people on election day when we don't bother to go to the polls. Whether we are Democrats or Republicans or Independents, we should owe that much, that much to our country and to the memory of Nathan Hale. 
   I talk to our young pages here and sometimes I borrow a history book from those who are here when they are attending school. I want to see what kind of history books they are reading in this day and time. When I was talking with these young pages a few days ago, I said, Who was Nathan Hale? Who here knows, who can tell me about Nathan Hale? 
   Well, sorrowfully, many of the history books today don't even mention Nathan Hale's name. Those are not history books. They are social science textbooks. Nathan Hale; and so he said, ``I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.'' 
   Those men and women risked everything, as I say--their lives, their fortunes, their lands, their families, their sacred honor, even the populations in the States they represented--when they boldly inked their names on the Declaration of Independence. 
   In the percussive thuds and whistling screams of today's fireworks I can hear--Can you hear?--the distant thunder of 
   cannons and the crack of flintlocks as the first major land battle of the Revolutionary War was pitched at Point Pleasant, West Virginia. When I see the great fireworks displays put on here in the Nation's capital, I see the shadows of the Capitol dome consumed in flames, as it was in August 1814. If I look out on the wide Potomac dotted with pleasure craft bobbing gently at anchor as still more people enjoy the fireworks, I can easily imagine General George Washington and his ragged Army struggling to cross the Delaware River for their daring Christmas day raid in the bitter cold of December 1776. And when I catch the scent of black powder drifting by as the night sky grows cloudy with the smoke from the explosions, I get the tingling sensation of fear and nerves that must have accompanied every soldier awaiting advancing Redcoats at Lexington and Concord. 
   What courage and what bravery were displayed by the people of this fledgling Nation, when first they undertook to break away from Great Britain. What great good fortune I, and everyone else who is listening, have, to be able to enjoy the fruits of their boldness, their courage, their willingness to give their lives. From coast to coast this weekend, we are able to freely gather, to celebrate, to rejoice, and, yes, to watch fireworks in a peaceful imitation of those perilous days over twenty decades ago. In this great land and its marvelously balanced Constitution, we have inherited a treasure beyond price. It is a treasure that we honor with our service and which we defend with our blood if need be. 
   So, while I enjoy the parades and picnics and fireworks of this happy holiday, I will also be offering my thanks to all those through the years who are responsible for struggling and winning the battles to secure our more perfect union, that we might be free to pursue health, happiness, and the blessings of liberty. My thanks also go to those men and women who today guard our freedom and who offer hope to others who fear the loss of their liberty, their lives, and their families. 
   I thank Nathan Hale who died on September 22, 1776, and who willingly would have died many times for his country. 
   We are a great and prosperous nation. We ought to thank God for his watchfulness over us, for the blessings he has showered upon our great country from its beginning, even before the Republic was instituted. 
   Just this week we have learned anew how prosperous we are, as the administration heralded new long-term estimates that paint a very bright economic picture of rising surpluses and falling debt. I must confess I am pretty wary of economic estimates. That is a science even far less exact than weather forecasting or even, it seems, astrology. It does seem clear that for the near term, at least, we may expect a small on-budget surplus that was not previously anticipated. I urge that we Senators support an effort to designate a substantial portion of these newly found resources to the Department of Veterans Affairs in order to support veterans health care. I have talked to my good friend and colleague, Mr. STEVENS, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and we are in agreement. But the fact that we are in agreement does not mean that the matter is settled. We have a tough uphill battle before us.  
   Veterans health care, a promise of lifetime care made to everyone who serves faithfully and well in the defense of our Nation, faces a funding crisis that threatens the quality and continuity of the health care that these men and women have come to depend upon. Veterans service organizations and others knowledgeable about the needs of America's veterans have pointed out that the fiscal year 2000 budget request for veterans health care is far below what is needed to meet demand and to allow the Veterans Administration to respond to new requirements levied by Congress. The budget resolution conference report adopted by the Congress earlier this year made a commitment to provide additional funds for veterans health care, but a budget resolution is a nonbinding document. Platitudes, good intentions, and fireworks do not pay doctor's bills. The funding caps passed by Congress have left the Appropriations Committee hamstrung, unable to provide more funding for this and other worthy causes. But now, if additional surpluses not associated with Social Security become available, I believe that we should try hard to honor our commitment made in the budget resolution, and honor our debt to the veterans who, in the spirit of those patriots of the Revolution, dared much, risked much, and sacrificed much that we might enjoy the blessings of freedom. They treasure our country and honor it with their service and their blood. I feel certain that my colleagues share with me a commitment to our Nation's veterans that is stronger and deeper than any allegiance to an arbitrary budget figure or cap that is based on a very different set of economic assumptions. 
   Mr. President, I have been fortunate to have traveled across the globe. I have seen many other lovely and ancient places, from Rome to Cairo to London to Tokyo to Moscow to that great crossroads of east and west that is Istanbul. I met warm and charming people in all these places and more. But, like Americans who will gather in far flung outposts around the globe next Monday to toast their homeland, and on Sunday to fly that flag in front of our homes, I am always glad to come home. No spot on earth calls to me like the mountains of my home, West Virginia, where the ground rises to meet my feet and the trees spread dappled umbrellas to shade me from the Sun; where glittering rivulets of clear, cold water flash like gems set in a verdant tapestry of ferns; and where birdsongs chime the hours away. In a gentle eternal symphony, raindrops hitting leaves provide the timpani and wind through the tossing branches serves as strings. The woodwind notes of mourning doves gently welcome the Sun each morning and whippoorwills pipe its setting in the evening. It is music for the heart as well as for the ears. 
   Nowhere are the people more dear to me than in West Virginia, where church doors are always ready to welcome the traveler and where in grocery stores there are clerks who still greet me by name and ask about my family. West Virginians are a proud people, proud of their heritage, proud of their home State. Wherever you may find them around the world--and I have found them in Afghanistan, in India, all across the globe--they are always proud to proclaim themselves Mountaineers. 
   I close with a favorite poem of mine by Henry van Dyke, ``America for Me'': 'Tis fine to see the Old World, and travel up and down Among the famous palaces and cities of renown, To admire the crumbly castles and the statues of the kings,-- But now I think I've had enough of antiquated things. 
 So it's home again, and home again, America for me! My heart is turning home again, and there I long to be, In the land of youth and freedom beyond the ocean bars, Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of stars. 
 Oh, London is a man's town, there's power in the air; And Paris is a woman's town, with flowers in her hair; And it's sweet to dream in Venice, and it's great to study in Rome But when it comes to living there is just no place like home. 
 I like the German fir-woods, in green battalions drilled; I like the gardens of Versailles with flashing fountains filled; But, oh, to take your hand, my dear, and ramble for a day In the friendly western woodland where Nature has her way! 
 I know that Europe's wonderful, yet something seems to lack: The Past is too much with her, and the people looking back. But the glory of the Present is to make the Future free,-- We love our land for what she is and what she is to be. 
 Oh, it's home again, and home again, America for me! I want a ship that's westward bound to plough the rolling sea, To the blessed Land of Room Enough beyond the ocean bars, Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of stars.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, my views on foreign assistance are well known. I don't like it. I understand there are circumstances in which the United States needs to extend a helping hand to other nations facing political and economic strains that we thankfully do not have to endure. I simply think that the United States spends too much of its citizens' hard-earned tax dollars overseas, and that is why I traditionally vote against the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill. 
   My reluctance to send U.S. tax dollars overseas leads me to scrutinize closely those programs that we do fund. One of the largest recipients of U.S. foreign assistance is the Middle East, and in particular Israel, and to a lesser extent, Egypt. These nations are our strongest allies in a troubled region, and I firmly believe that maintaining a strong relationship with them is in the best strategic interests of the United States. We cannot forget that it was Egypt and Israel that negotiated the Camp David Accords, an historic breakthrough in the efforts to  bring peace to the Middle East. As part of the Camp David Accords, a concept was reached regarding the ratio of United States foreign assistance between Egypt and Israel. This formula has been followed since the signing of the Accords. 
   I have believed for many years that the United States is spending too much on foreign assistance to Egypt and Israel. I have tried in the past, to no avail, to reduce the level of assistance being sent to Israel. I am pleased that the United States has finally embarked on a program of reducing economic assistance to both nations, with the agreement of those nations. However, maintaining proportionality between Egypt and Israel as the level of foreign assistance is reduced is vitally important, and never more so than now, when the recent elections in Israel offer fresh hope of restarting the peace process. 
   Unfortunately, the mechanism by which United States foreign assistance is currently being provided to Egypt and Israel has resulted in an imbalance to that program in that Israel has the unique advantage of having immediate access to an interest bearing account while Egypt has not been accorded the same treatment. This, I believe, is a procedure which can be interpreted as a departure from the standard of fairness that is central to United States assistance under the Camp David Accords. 
   Mr. President, this is an injustice that should be corrected. Speaking frankly, it is my opinion that neither Israel nor Egypt should be earning interest on United States foreign assistance. But, under the principles of parity that underlie the Camp David Accords, both nations should receive the same treatment. Egypt and Israel are pivotal allies in the Middle East, and the United States should accord them equal treatment in disbursing its foreign assistance.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today we honor 20 years of service to the Senate by its Chief Reporter, Ron Kavulick. For 16 years, beginning in 1979, Ron  worked on the Senate floor as a reporter of debates, where he distinguished himself as a friend to everyone and as one who labored mightily to accurately report Senators' statements for publication in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. He was a stickler for detail and bent over backwards to make sure every aspect of his work was correct, as he strove to preserve Senate history to its fullest. 
   As a result of his tenacity and dedication, Ron was promoted to Chief Reporter in 1995. In that position, Ron was invaluable to the Senate in his dedication to the accuracy of the CONGESSIONAL RECORD. He gave of himself unselfishly to be a fair and considerate supervisor. 
   Ron now retires to be with his wife, Pat, and their two married children, Jeff and Susan, and granddaughter Allison. 
   The Senate today says thank you to Ron and his family for his exemplary service to the Senate and its family. He truly is our friend.

   Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I support the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   Let me thank my friend from Illinois, who is one of the newer Members of this body. He has had much experience in the other body. He comes to this body with a tremendously versatile mind. He can speak almost at the drop of a hat. He is very conversant on every subject. He fights today for a cause which is important. I congratulate him. He has been speaking on the floor for several days on this subject. He speaks with great eloquence. I congratulate him and look forward to hearing him on other occasions. I hope in this situation he and we will be successful at some point. 
   I support the Patients' Bill of Rights. This is important legislation that, if enacted, will provide important protections to the many millions of Americans who receive their health care from managed care companies. It is therefore critically important that the Senate conduct a full debate on this issue. I am saddened that supporters of this legislation have been put in the position of offering this measure to an appropriations bill, thereby temporarily stalling progress on funding programs that are a priority for yet other Americans. 
   While I consider a vote on the Patients' Bill of Rights imperative in this Congress, I am also very concerned that putting important issues at loggerheads with one another may ultimately interfere with the smooth operation of the government. We should all strive to avoid a repeat of the train wreck that resulted in last year's Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations bill. Putting the Senate in the position of having to choose between competing critical needs is a dangerous game that we should not play. It is bad public policy. There is still enough room on the calendar for both a thorough debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights and for timely progress on the important work of passing the Fiscal Year 2000 appropriations bills. I urge the leadership to move forward in a fair manner--to allow this bill to be fully considered and debated, and to let amendments to the Patients' Bill of Rights be called up and debated and voted on--voted up or down or amended again. 
   Action on the Patients' Bill of Rights has been delayed for too long. As the Congress stalls, problems with managed care companies increase. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation/Harvard University survey, the number of people reporting having problems with their health plan, or who know someone who has had a problem with their health plan, rose from 96 million in 1996 to 115 million in 1998. With 85 percent of all insured employees in managed care plans, this issue is too far-reaching to be delayed. 
   While managed care has been successful in stemming health care inflation in recent years, it has too often compromised patients' health care needs. Unfortunately and tragically, some health insurers have put saving money ahead of patients' well-being. Instead of patient care, we are getting ``investor care,'' with health plans keeping a constant eye on shareholder profits. Our Patients' Bill of Rights would provide important and necessary protections for families to ensure they get the care they need. 
   Too often, managed care plans erect barriers that interfere with patients getting the medical services they need when confronted with an emergency. Under this measure, patients do not have to fear that their emergency room care will not be covered if they have reason to believe they need emergency care. They will not have to call for permission first and waste precious time hoping for clearance. Someone who experiences chest pain and believes he or she is having a heart attack should not have to check to see whether the health plan will cover the emergency room care. The ``prudent layperson'' standard gives patients the ability to seek emergency room care with the assurance that it will be covered. 
   Comprehensive managed care reform legislation should also provide women in managed care plans important protections. Oftentimes, women use their ob/gyn as their primary care provider. Having managed care plans recognize this fact will eliminate time-consuming and costly administrative barriers women face in getting the care they need. A woman and her doctor should be able to make the decision, for example, as to how long she needs to stay in the hospital after a mastectomy, not some health plan bureaucrat. 
   In recent years, health plan coverage of patients' participation in clinical trials has declined. This is a troubling trend. Under S. 6, of which I am a cosponsor, health plans would be required to cover the routine costs associated with a patient's participation in certain clinical trials. This is an important provision because in some cases clinical trials may be the only option for patients who have not responded to conventional treatments. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights also has special protections for children's access to care. The bill provides guaranteed access to pediatric specialists. When a child has a chronic condition our bill allows standing referrals to pediatric specialists which eliminates the extra step of seeking the consent of the primary care provider. Under our bill, if a pediatric specialist is not included in the health plan's network, your child would have the right to see a specialist outside the network without having to pay more. 
   Patients undergoing treatment need to know that, if their doctor is dropped by the health plan or if their employer changes their health plan, they can still see their doctor. S. 6 offers continuity of coverage by requiring a 90-day transition period during which treatment is continued. For example, a terminally ill patient should not have to go through the disruption of changing doctors as that patient faces death. 
   I have long been concerned about West Virginians' access to health care and, over the years, I have been successful in bringing facilities and technologies to the State to expand my constituents' access to quality care. Marshall University's Rural Health Center; the VA hospitals and clinics; and Mountaineer Doctor Television (MDTV), West Virginia's Statewide telemedicine program, are projects that have broadened West Virginians' ability to receive quality care in West Virginia. As managed care continues to grow in the State, it is important that common-sense protections are in place so that patients can get the care they need. 
   The Republicans have introduced their own managed care reform legislation in response to the Democrat's Patients' Bill of Rights. But, the Republican plan would leave over 100 million Americans without protection. By applying reforms only to self-funded employer plans, the Republican bill leaves those most in need of protection--people who buy their insurance without the assistance of their employer and those who work for small businesses--out in the cold. 
   Scope of coverage is not the only weakness of the Republican plan. Even the protections provided to a limited number of Americans under their plan  do not go far enough. While differences exist in the shape and scope of the reform proposals, one thing is clear. There is a crying need in the lives of real Americans for action to address these health care problems. We need a thorough debate, an open debate about this issue, a debate which is not constrained by limits on amendments or by a desire to hold such a critical matter hostage to partisan politics, and we need it now. We also need to move forward on appropriations bills which fund important programs all across the spectrum of American life. I can only hope that reason will prevail in this body, and that we will allow all of these important matters to proceed in a timely and sincere manner as soon as possible. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania. I am one of the original cosponsors of the quota bill. I urge my colleagues to support cloture. I compliment my very able colleague, JAY ROCKEFELLER, for his diligent work on this matter. I also compliment Mr. SANTORUM, our colleague from Pennsylvania, for his equally good work. 
   The quota bill is a critical measure in addressing the steel import crisis that is confronting U.S. steel mills, and I am mystified by statements suggesting that the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Bill is a competing interest against the quota bill. 
   I am here to set the record straight. 
   As a result of global financial chaos, in 1998, a record level of 40 million tons of cheap and illegally dumped imported steel flooded the U.S. market. That represents an 83 percent increase over the 23 million tons average for the previous eight years! The result has been the loss of 10,000 steel jobs, and the bankruptcy of several U.S. steel mills. 
   While both bills are before the Senate because of the steel import crisis--one has been passed and the conferees thereon were appointed yesterday--the quota bill and the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Bill serve vastly different purposes, and both deserve support from every member in the Senate. 
   The quota bill is a long-term solution to the steel import crisis. The quota  bill would cap steel imports at a level that equals the average amount of steel that came into U.S. markets in 1995, 1996, and the first half of 1997. The measure would take effect immediately and prohibit any country from sending more steel to the United States than it did in July of 1997. The quotas would terminate in three years. The President could achieve these import limits by imposing quotas, tariff surcharges, negotiated enforceable voluntary export restraint agreements, or other means. 
   The Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program which passed the Senate last week is a helping hand to U.S. steel mills that have been injured by the cheap and illegal imports. It is a short-term assistance program to aid U.S. steel mills during their hour of need. It does not address the underlying critical problem of both cheap and illegally dumped imported steel that continues to adversely impact U.S. steel mills. While essential to aiding thousands of hardworking Americans, the steel loan guarantee program is no substitute, nor was it intended to be, for the long-term solution that is offered by the quota bill. 
   The House of Representatives passed the quota bill by a vote of 289 yeas to 141 nays. Now it is the Senate's turn to send a vigorous message to our trading partners that this nation will not idly sit by while another American industry is shipped abroad. 
   Last week, I strongly urged my colleagues to support the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program. It is a fair and important measure for the U.S. steel industry and thousands of hardworking Americans. Let there be no mistake: members can not hide behind one vote and claim to have solved the crisis in our domestic steel industry. The Senate must act to help the U.S. steel industry on a long-term basis as well. This Senate acted wisely in passing the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program. It provides a cash flow for financially damaged steel companies and it will enable them to invest in further modernization. It will save jobs that are at risk from illegal imports. Likewise, this Senate should ensure that the need for the loan guarantee program is minimized by casting a vote that will stop the illegal dumping of foreign steel. The quota bill will stop the cheating and finally provide U.S. steel mills with an international playing field that is fair. 
   I thank the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. SANTORUM, for his courtesy and kindness. I thank my colleague from West Virginia, Mr. ROCKEFELLER, for his leadership in this matter. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this bill on which we are about to vote is a buy-American bill. A vote for this bill is a buy-American vote, a vote of confidence in American steel, American workers, and American families. But a vote against the bill sends a very different message. It says buy Russian, buy Japanese, buy South Korean, buy from our foreign competitors and send our steel industry and our steel jobs overseas. I urge my colleagues to vote American. 
   Now, if I have any time remaining in the 2 1/2 minutes, I wish to compliment Mr. NICKLES, Mr. GRAMM, and others who were the opponents of the bill. They were honorable opponents, and I think they made good contributions, especially in our discussions yesterday. Their proposals improve the bill. I was happy to support their proposals and to join as a cosponsor of the amendment. 
   I especially wish to thank Senator STEVENS and Senator DOMENICI. Senator STEVENS has kept his word. He is a man of his word. Senator DOMENICI has done a great job in proposing a similar program for the oil and gas industry. I hope that he will be able to speak likewise at some point. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, this is an appropriations bill. I believe Mr. STEVENS at some point in the afternoon will be on the floor to manage the bill. Mr. DOMENICI, who is very deeply involved in this bill as well, and who is on the Appropriations Committee, will be on the floor and will, as between himself and Mr. STEVENS, manage the bill. I am not managing the bill, but until one of those Senators comes to the floor, I have a few things I can say about it. 
   First, I thank the majority leader for making it possible for us to take up this bill at this time. I also thank the minority leader for his cooperation in that regard. 
   I thank the majority leader for keeping his word with respect to calling up this matter. I will have possibly a little more to say about that later, so I will explain what I mean in having said that. 
   I thank Mr. STEVENS, who was chairman of the Senate side of the conference, which occurred on the emergency supplemental appropriations bill a few weeks ago. I thank the House chairman of the conference, Mr. BILL YOUNG of Florida, for his many courtesies that were extended upon that occasion, and for his fairness in conducting the conference, and for his cooperation in helping to work out a way in which we could at that point let the emergency supplemental appropriations conference report be on its way and be sent back to the House and Senate for the 
   final consideration of both of those Houses. I thank him for his efforts in bringing about an agreement whereby that emergency supplemental appropriations bill was let loose--if I may use that term--from the chains which at the moment had it locked in an impasse in conference. 
   The provision in this bill, which is before the Senate, and in which I am very interested, is what we refer to as the ``steel loan guarantee provision.'' There is a similar provision which Mr. DOMENICI was able to include in the bill, and it is similar to the steel loan guarantee except that it has to do with oil and gas. It provides a loan guarantee program for the oil and gas industry. He will more carefully and thoroughly explain that part of the bill later on. 
   Both of these provisions had been included in the emergency supplemental appropriations bill. Both of these provisions were in the emergency supplemental appropriations bill when it passed the Senate. Senators had an opportunity, when the emergency supplemental appropriations bill was before the Senate, to offer amendments to the steel loan guarantee language and to the oil and gasoline guarantee language. Senators had that opportunity. 
   No amendments were offered to those provisions when that bill was before the Senate. Those provisions were put into that bill when that appropriations bill, the emergency supplemental appropriations bill, was marked up in the Senate Appropriations Committee. Therefore, those provisions, as I have already said, were included in the bill when it reached the floor, when it came before the Senate. The Senate passed the bill. No amendments were offered to those provisions at that time. 
   That bill went to conference with the House in due course. It was a period of several weeks before the House-Senate conference took place on that bill. When the conference did occur, these two provisions--the steel loan guarantee provision and the oil and gasoline guarantee provision--were gradually put off until the very end of the conference. 
   The conference on that bill lasted for several hours over a period of 3 or 4 days. But it was the wish of both Chairman YOUNG and the chairman of the Senate conferees, Chairman STEVENS, to delay consideration of those two parts of the bill until other matters in the bill, other differences between the two Houses, had been resolved. 
   As a consequence, as I say, it was toward the very end that we finally got around to those two provisions, the loan guarantee provisions. 
   In the conference, a vote occurred on the steel loan guarantee provision late one evening. I think the vote really occurred after midnight, so it was 12:30 or 1 o'clock in the morning of the next day that we finally voted on the steel loan guarantee provision, which had been written in the Senate Appropriations Committee, which had come before the Senate, which had been adopted by the Senate. 
   When that vote occurred, all of the Democratic conferees on the House side voted to accept the steel loan guarantee provision which was in the Senate bill; three of the Republican House conferees voted to accept the steel loan guarantee provision. So by a vote, I believe, of 13-10, the conference adopted the steel loan guarantee provision. 
   The next day when the conferees met, a motion was made to reconsider the vote that had occurred the previous late evening and the motion to reconsider carried. Two of the Republican House Members of the conference switched their votes from the previous position of supporting the steel loan guarantee to their new position of opposing that guarantee. As a consequence, my steel loan guarantee provision lost, I think, by a vote of 12-11. It lost by one vote. 
   An impasse prevailed. Senator DOMENICI's oil and gas loan guarantee provision had been rejected by the House conferees; on the second vote, the steel loan guarantee provision, which I had authored, was rejected by the House conferees. There was an impasse. The House conferees wouldn't give and the Senate conferees wouldn't give. 
   Therefore, rather than see the emergency supplemental appropriations bill die in conference, I suggested we have a recess and try to work out an agreement whereby we could find a way to let that emergency supplemental appropriations bill fly with its wings out of the conference, go to the President's desk. In that bill, there were appropriations for the military in Kosovo, there was a pay increase for the military, and there were various and sundry disaster relief provisions which were intended to help people in South and Central America and in the United States, as well--American farmers and so on. It was certainly not my desire to kill that bill; it was not my desire to delay. 
   I said: Let's have a recess, Mr. Chairmen--addressing my remarks to the two chairmen--let's have a recess and see if we can't work things out.  
   We had a recess and met down below, on the next floor of this Chamber, where we stand now. I met in the Appropriations Committee room with the House chairman, Mr. YOUNG, the Senate chairman, Mr. STEVENS, being present, along with the House minority, the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, Mr. OBEY, being present, and with the Senate minority or ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, myself, being present, together with a couple of other House Members representing the majority and the minority and a couple of other Senate Members representing the majority. 
   It was there that we agreed to take our hands off the emergency supplemental appropriations bill and let it go to the President and be signed. We wanted a commitment that these two provisions which had worked their way through the legislative process, coming before the Senate, going to conference, 
   be given a chance to pass and become law aside from the emergency appropriations supplemental. 
   I talked with our majority leader, Mr. LOTT, and our minority leader, Mr. DASCHLE. They both agreed that it was very important to let the emergency supplemental appropriations bill be on its way and that they would help me and Mr. DOMENICI soon get a freestanding appropriations bill up before the Senate which would have in it the steel loan guarantee provision and the oil and gas loan guarantee provision. 
   With that assurance from the two leaders here, I proceeded to ask Mr. YOUNG, the chairman of the House conferees, if he and Mr. OBEY and Mr. CALLAHAN, a Republican member of the House conference, could proceed to talk with the Speaker of the House and get a commitment out of the Speaker that would let us deal with a freestanding appropriations bill that would give these two provisions I referred to a chance for consideration in both Houses, and hopefully for passage in both Houses. 
   The Speaker committed himself to calling up the bill within 1 week if it came over from the Senate; committed himself, secondly, to appointing conferees in the normal fashion so that there would not be stacked conferees; committed himself, thirdly, to having a vote on a conference report on the measure promptly. 
   With those commitments, we let the emergency supplemental appropriations bill fly on its way to the White House and the Oval Office where it was signed into law. 
   Now came the time for the leadership and the Senate to keep its commitment. It did. That is what I was referring to when I thanked the majority leader a few minutes ago for having kept his word. He and Mr. DASCHLE kept their word. Of course, as we all know, the main responsibility and power rests with the majority leader in the Senate in things of this kind. Mr. LOTT arranged for us to call up this bill, have this bill before the Senate now. Cloture was invoked on it last Friday by an overwhelming majority, 71-28, on the motion to proceed. The motion to proceed was then adopted by voice vote. So the bill is before the Senate this afternoon. 
   I see my good colleague, Mr. DOMENICI, is on the floor, ready to proceed. Let me just add one or two things. 
   Having made the explanation here as to where we are, how we came to be here, let me say that because of the circumstances which have been obtained from the beginning and which I have outlined and which resulted in the two provisions in this bill having already been before the Senate, having passed the Senate, without amendment in the Senate, I would hope there would be no amendments to this bill by the Senate today. 
   The Senate has already had its chance to make a run at these two provisions. Senators have already had their chances to offer amendments to these two provisions when they were before the Senate in the emergency supplemental appropriations bill. Now the majority leader has carried out his commitment of helping to get the bill up. The minority leader has carried out his commitment. I hope we will have the support of the two leaders, but they have carried out the spirit of their original commitment. 
   Now the commitment by the Speaker remains. But he didn't make a commitment to this bill if it is loaded down with a lot of amendments when it goes back over there. He did not make any commitment on that score. Whatever we put into this bill, whether it be nongermane or germane, he made no commitment on that kind of thing. He made a commitment with respect to these two provisions, the steel loan guarantee and the oil and gas loan guarantee. 
   I want the Speaker to keep his commitment, but I want him to be able to keep his commitment. I don't want us to load this bill down with nongermane amendments and send them back over there. We can't expect the Speaker to keep his commitment on that kind of thing, because he didn't make any such commitment. He only made a commitment with respect to these two provisions. That is not saying that the two provisions cannot be improved. Perhaps they can be. And I may support an improvement. I think, if they were improved upon, the Speaker would, I have a feeling--I haven't talked with him--would still feel that came within his commitment. But we can't bring in an amendment by every Tom, Dick, and Harry and add it and let it run the gamut of whatever the subject matter may be, nongermane, and expect the Speaker to take this bill up within 3 days, or whatever it was, promptly after it goes over there. 
   So help us to help the Speaker to keep his commitment. I urge all Senators to be conscious of the facts as I have attempted to state them and see that we have an obligation. I think the Senate has an obligation, having passed these two provisions once, and in the face of losing my grip on the emergency supplemental appropriation bill. I had that bill in these two fists, and so did Mr. DOMENICI. We didn't want to kill that bill. But we let that bill go, as we should have done. After all, we are all interested, first of all, in our country, and we want to see legislation passed that is in the best interests of our country. Senator DOMENICI and Senator STEVENS and I, and other Senators on the conference, came to that conclusion. We did the right thing. 
   Now I think Senators have some obligation. I understand their rights. Senators have a right to offer any amendments they want. There is no rule of germaneness in the Senate with respect to circumstances as they prevail at this moment. But it seems to me there is an unwritten obligation on the part of Senators to play fair, and to play fair here is to let our provisions be debated, and if they can be improved upon, fine. But let's not muddy the waters by offering amendments that are not germane, because when we do that, as I say, we can't expect the Speaker just to take anything we send over there and let his commitment earlier govern his actions. 
   I think that is about all I have to say at the moment. I will have more to say on the steel loan guarantee provision later. Mr. DOMENICI, as I have already indicated, can far 
   better explain the somewhat similar loan guarantee on the oil and gas provision. 
   I do have a luncheon I am supposed to attend. I am supposed to speak there now. I have discussed this with my friend. Senator DOMENICI has indicated that, if he can, he would watch the floor and help me to be away a little while. He has to be away some, too, as does Mr. STEVENS. 
   Having said that, I thank all Senators for listening. I thank my friend from New Mexico, who is a valiant comrade and colleague and formidable opponent and a very worthwhile and desirable supporter. I prefer to be on his side rather than not. I thank him for all of the courtesies and considerations that he has given to me in this bill, as well as in thousands of other instances in which we have worked together.

   Mr. BYRD. I merely want to thank the distinguished Senator for his support in this matter. He comes from a State and represents people who are very much like my State and my people. He understands the problems of the steel industry and the fact that many steelworkers have been laid off, others have lost their jobs permanently. 
   I have to leave to be elsewhere for an hour or so. I will not be able to listen to the Senator's speech. That is why I interrupted him, to apologize for not being here to hear his speech, but to thank him for speaking, thank him for his support in this matter, and also to express my exceedingly high regard for him as a Senator, as a gentleman, and as someone who is dedicated, sincere, conscientious, and always courteous and helpful.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I also thank the very distinguished Senator from Alabama, Mr. SESSIONS, for his comments and for his work on this bill. I thank, as well, Mr. SHELBY, the senior Senator from Alabama, for his support and for the work that he has contributed to this legislation. 
   I feel very good about having their support. They are both very able Senators, and they are utilizing their talents in the best interests of the Nation in supporting this legislation. 
   American steelworkers earn their daily bread by the sweat of their brow. That is in accordance with the edict that was placed upon man when God evicted Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. Steelworkers are earning their daily bread by the sweat of their brow amid the glow of productive glass furnaces filled with molten steel. American fortunes were built on their backs. Their collective might forged a national defense and a national economy second to none. 
   Today, after almost 20 years of downsizing and rightsizing and modernizing, just 160,000 steelworkers are employed in state-of-the-art American steel mills, compared to some 400,000 --400,000--in 1980. The industry, which retooled to adapt to international market changes, is now a world class--a world class--competitor, even while adhering to high U.S. safety, labor, and environmental standards. But the ranks of American steelworkers, it appears, are in danger of future cuts that could undermine their ability to support U.S. priorities. 
   This situation is not, as some would have us believe, due to a failure of the steel industry to economize or to increase efficiency. America's steel industry serves as a model in the art of modernizing to enhance competitive prowess. America's steel producers have sacrificed, they have trimmed, and they have automated, investing nearly $60 billion in the process. In return, they have been forced to compete on a playing field that is tilted--tilted--by the weight of the unfair and illegal trade practices of foreign competitors. 
   Last year, a record 41 1/2 million tons of cheap and illegally dumped steel  flooded the U.S. market. Piles of this foreign-made, below-cost steel amassed at our ports. It drove U.S. producers to drop prices, to impose layoffs, to shut down furnaces, and to slow down production. 
   Those cold mounds of steel represented an 83-percent increase in the amount of steel imported into this country--83 percent over the 23 million tons, on average, imported in each of the previous 8 years. 
   Contrary to some reports, this Congress was notified of signs of a potential flood of both legal and illegal steel imports in January 1998. I, in conjunction with the Senate steel caucus leadership, have worked during this year and a half to lay a foundation that would provide meaningful help to the U.S. steel industry. The chairman of that steel caucus is Senator SPECTER, and the ranking member, or vice chairman, is my colleague from West Virginia, Senator JAY ROCKEFELLER. I have joined the Senate steel caucus in writing numerous letters to the administration and in holding hearings and discussions to provide testimony about the impact of the crisis. 
   I commend Mr. SPECTER and my colleague, Mr. ROCKEFELLER, on the work that they have done. 
   Although prices for steel have been dropping below domestic manufacturers' costs to produce due to the flood of imports, the U.S. market still offers an outlet for surpluses generated by very sharply depressed demand in Asia and elsewhere. A poor market is better than no market, so rather than idle their own furnaces and mills, foreign exporters are flooding the U.S. market. The United States was the principal destination in 1998 for Japanese-finished steel mill exports that were diverted from the depressed Asian market--to the tune of 4.2 million tons of the 4.7 million tons that Japan had exported to Asia just 1 year earlier. 
   In 1996, Japan exported just 18,190 net tons of hot-rolled sheet steel to the United States each month, on average, a modest increase over 1995. But, in 1997, that figure of 18,000 net tons rose to 43,095 net tons each month, on average. 
    From January through September 1998, that average monthly figure had skyrocketed to 192,812 net tons. Over the same period, however, the value of each ton of Japanese hot-rolled sheet steel fell, from $460 a ton in 1995, to $409 in 1996, to $367 in 1997, to $295 a ton in 1998. At the same time, Japan's domestic market remains virtually closed to foreign steel, allowing Japanese steel mills to command unusually high prices at home. 
   A similar story can be told in the case of Russian hot-rolled sheet steel. In 1995, the average monthly import volume was 46,661 tons. In 1996, that figure had climbed to 67,587 tons per month. In 1997, it was 165,268 tons per month, and from January through September 1998, the average monthly import volume of Russian hot-rolled sheet and plate-in-coil steel was 286,311 tons. At the same time, the price per ton fell from $316 in 1995 to just $240 in 1998. That is a lot of cheap steel to absorb, and that is just one particular type of steel product. 
   Our government's response to this threat was to handle cheating--cheating--foreign competitors with kid gloves due to concerns that the economies of those foreign nations have been in distress. 
   Now, who pays our way here? Who pays the fare for our trip from Sophia, WV, to Washington, DC? Who pays the fare from Arkansas to Washington, DC? Who pays the fare from Kansas, for those who represent Kansas in the Congress, to Washington, DC? Not those foreign competitors, I can assure you, as far as I am concerned. They don't pay our way. They don't pay our fare. They don't pay us. We are not on their payroll. The people of West Virginia send me here, and the road that leads to Washington leads back home. 
   I am going to be first, last, and always interested in the people of our own Nation who look to us for leadership, look to us to help them with their problems--not the foreign competitors. 
   The argument has been made that caution must be exercised so as not to push these teetering economies over the edge. I understand concerns about the intertwined economies of an increasingly global marketplace, but my heart will not bleed for cheaters. My heart aches for those American men and women who have worked and sacrificed and followed the rules, only to have their futures and the futures of their families, their communities, and their steel industry thrown into question. 
   The illegal dumping of steel on American shores is real. It is not imaginary. It is not something we are just dreaming about. It is not something we are seeing visions about. It is real. The crisis does exist. 
   Our domestic steel industry has been seeking remedy through antidumping and countervailing trade cases. The Commerce Department has ruled on or is investigating cases against Japan, Russia, Brazil, South Korea, France, Italy, India, and Indonesia. On June 11, just last Friday, the International Trade Commission, by a 6-0 ruling, found that imports of dumped hot rolled steel from Japan are ``materially injuring or threatening material injury'' to the U.S. steel industry. 
   Based on this determination, duties will be retroactively applied to imports from Japan that enter the United States after February, 19, 1999, but the international trade system established to help domestic manufacturers recover from trade-induced damage has thus far failed our steelmakers. The process is too painfully slow. 
   When I was a boy I read a book, ``The Slow Train Through Arkansas.'' We are talking about a slow process here, and it has failed our steelmakers. The process is too painfully slow to avert long-term financial disaster for many U.S. steel mills. 
   One of the opponents to this bill said the other day: Well we have a process here. 
   Yes, we have a process. I am saying it is too painfully slow to avert long-term financial disaster for many U.S. steel mills. 
   That is why we have come to the floor with this bill, this provision that will help in the short-term. Damage must be done before a case can even be filed. Now, that is the process; damage must be done before a case can even be filed, and the investigation and the adjudication takes months. 
   Even if our steel companies succeed in getting our trade laws to support them by levying tariffs on unfair competitors or otherwise reducing their attempts at undercutting our domestic market, these steel mills will not receive any of those tariffs to make up for their losses or to help out their workers. The damage has been done. The damage has been done. 
   At best, they will get an eventual reduction of illegal imports that will allow them to compete in their own country, at least until some other nation decides to flood our markets. It is not fair. It is not right. It is not right for our steel industry. It is not right for our steelworkers. It is not fair to our steelworkers. Nor will communities that are hard hit by layoffs and threats of layoffs receive any direct compensation from the tariffs that are paid by illegal dumping. The damage has been done. 
   The little community of Weirton has been hard hit. The Weirton Steel Company employed 14,000 men and women a few years ago; today, it is down under 5,000. The Weirton Steel Company is the lifeblood of Weirton, WV. Without it, the community would be dead, dead, dead! 
   There are other communities. But these communities, as I say, that are hard hit by layoffs--and there have been additional layoffs at Weirton; 800 steelworkers laid off since last November because of this illegal dumping of below-cost steel into American ports by those foreign countries that wave their nose at the trade laws. Communities hard hit by layoffs and threats of layoffs will not receive any direct compensation from the tariffs paid by illegal dumpers. 
   Now, that is the process. They say, well, let the process work. 
   The recent years of uncertainty that deterred people from buying houses, buying cars, buying anything they might have to finance longer than their job might last, no one can make up for those kinds of losses that ripple through a community, affecting jobs, affecting lives that are directly linked to a steel mill paycheck. 
   This crisis may not be abating, as some would have us believe. Foreign steel markets are not yet rebounding to their previous levels, and oversupply remains very high. Nearly all of the recent import declines are due to antidumping cases against just three countries. Historically, such cases have  eventually caused increased imports from other exporters and for other steel products. We have seen that in this instance, as well. 
   When the Commerce Department investigates import surges of a particular type of steel from a single source, that exporter temporarily cleans up his act. You see, he gets religion fast. He cleans up his act with regard to that particular type of steel. But he makes up for it. The right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing in that case. While he cleans up that act, he makes up for it by flooding the U.S. market with a different steel product that is not under investigation, or another nation steps in to fill the opening provided by tariffs placed on a foreign competitor. 
   So no sooner is one dog leashed than another dog is on the attack. For many months, manufacturers and steelworkers lobbied and protested and cried: ``Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'' 
   They protested and tried every conceivable approach to draw the U.S. Government's attention to their plight, and their pleas were met by dawdling and disbelief. 
   We cannot afford to continue hemming and hawing, as the fires die down in the blast furnaces at Weirton, WV, or in Illinois or Indiana or Missouri or Alabama or Pennsylvania or Ohio. This is an emergency. That is why it was put into an emergency appropriations bill. It requires urgent action. We have responded to emergencies in other industries and in other nations; why can we not respond to a critical situation in our own steel industry? 
   Do you remember the story of Joseph and Mary, who went from Nazareth up to Judea to pay their taxes? They went to Bethlehem. Their baby was born and wrapped in swaddling clothes and laid in a manger. Why was it laid in a manger? Because there was no room at the inn. There was no room for the baby at the inn. It had to be laid in a manger because there was no room for Joseph and Mary and the baby at the inn. No room at the inn. So to the steelworkers, there is no room for the steelworkers at the inn, no room at the inn. 
   This crisis cannot be merely dismissed as a West Virginia matter, as some sought to do earlier. I know the word went around, well, this is just to help workers in West Virginia; this is just to help Senator BYRD from West Virginia. That is not the case. That is not the case. 
   So this crisis cannot merely be dismissed as a West Virginia matter. This is a national matter. It affects Kentucky. It affects Virginia. When one industry hurts in this country, the whole country hurts. When steelworkers are thrown out of jobs, there is a great ripple effect. When jobs are lost 
   in Indiana and Illinois and West Virginia, it hurts in Kentucky. It hurts in Virginia. This is a national matter involving an industry that stretches across the Nation. 
   When you see those television pictures of the tanks in the Balkans, those tanks are not made of pasteboard. They are not made of nylon. They are not made of plastic. They are made of steel. I know what it is to weld that steel, having welded in the shipyards in World War II. It was this mighty country with its steel mills and its experienced steelworkers and its efficient steel companies that made the ships to carry the manpower and the weaponry to Europe in World War I and in World War II. Let another war come. We will send tanks of pasteboard? 
   The ill effects that have been visited upon this industry loom in Utah, Illinois, Arkansas, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Alabama, California, and other States. It touches the lives of all Americans. Just read the newspapers and the trade publications from around the Nation. 
   Bankruptcy looms for Gadsden, AL, based Gulf States Steel. Last month, Laclede Steel shut down its Alton, IL, pipe and tube plant, putting 200 employees out of work because of high levels of imports. 
   In April, FirstMiss, a Pennsylvania steel producer of high-grade specialty steel, announced plans to shut down, putting 140 people out of work. 
   These are Americans. These are people of flesh and blood, just as you and I are flesh and blood. 
   Geneva Steel Company of Vineyard, UT, filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy in February, citing the surge in steel imports as the cause of its financial distress. Geneva Steel employs roughly 2,400 workers in Utah making hot-rolled and plate steel. In December 1998, Geneva officials had conceded that they would be unable to make January's interest payments on senior notes. 
   Bethlehem Steel officials announced in January that the steel import crisis caused them to decide to close two plants--in Washington, PA, and Massillon, OH--and eliminate a total of 540 jobs. Not surprisingly, no buyer could be found for the Massillon mill, given the poor market prospects. 
   In November 1998, Bethlehem Steel temporarily shut down facilities in Burns Harbor, IN, and Steelton, PA; it cut back shifts at facilities in Sparrows Point, PA, and idled production lines in Coatsville, PA, that employed 1,000 people, all because of unfair, illegal competition from imported steel, and unfair competition from foreign countries. 
   The Scriptures say that charity begins at home. We don't want charity. We simply want a fair, level field so the American steelworkers, whose efficiency is as great or greater than that of any other workers in the world, can make their way, can earn by the sweat of their brow their daily bread. 
   I have been in the Senate 41 years. I have never turned my back on any other State or any category of people in this country who are hard up and who are out of work and who need help in order to earn their bread by the sweat of their brow. 
   Whether it is in my State or not, if it is somewhere else in America that an industry, that the farmers need help, that the farmers need loans, that the homebuilders need loans, I am here to help, always have been. I do not say it does not help my people. I do not say that. The chain is as strong as its weakest link. I say help them if it is on the west coast, if it is on the east coast, if it is in the North or the South--wherever. If it is America, count me in. 
   In November, LTV officials announced that the company would permanently close some operations at their Cleveland Works facility, eliminating 320 jobs, because, in part, of dumped imports. The previous month, LTV had temporarily laid off an additional 320 workers on a different production line. U.S. Steel also cut back operations in November, laying off several hundred of the 850 workers at the Fairless, Pennsylvania, plant. These are not West Virginia plants, but if it hurts Pennsylvania; it hurts me; it hurts West Virginia. 
   National Steel announced the idling a blast furnace producing 1.1 million tons of iron at its Great Lakes Division last October, reducing the steelmaking capacity there by 25 to 30 percent. Last September, California Steel Industries reported that it had lost 15 to 20 percent of its sales volume, and had reduced production operations proportionally. Also last September, Illinois-based Acme Metals, Incorporated, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, halting production at a new, $370 million slab caster designed to take advantage of its high-quality blast furnace operations while linking it to low-cost, mini-mill style casting and rolling equipment. So much for modernizing to remain competitive! We have done it. The steel industry has done it. They have modernized the steel mills. The lesson steel makers have learned is that their investment decisions to remain modern and efficient can be undercut at any time by foreign producers driven by their own interests, or subsidized by their own governments, to increase their market share by driving under the domestic competition. 
   I could go on, but I think I have made my point. These American steel companies are suffering not only from the kind of depressed export market that has led the administration and this Congress to provide emergency relief to our Nation's farmers, but also from unfair, below-cost imports that are squeezing our steel industry out of our domestic market. Why is it this Congress can so readily support funding for direct low-cost loans to farmers--and I am for that--in order to help them survive the tough times, but some Members balk at providing loan guarantees to allow an equally critical industry--one that is necessary to maintain a robust defense as well as a robust economy--to obtain market rate loans to restructure debt and tough out a battle against depressed  markets and unfair competition? I confess that I simply do not understand this logic. 
   Help the farmers. We have heard that cry from the steeple tops, and my vote has been there. I do not have large farms in West Virginia, but when the call comes to help the farmers, my vote has been there. I have never opposed help for all the farmers. 
   I have been on the Appropriations Committee 41 years, Mr. President. You do not find me opposing aid to farmers just because West Virginia does not have big farms. Why provide loans and grants for foreign governments? What is the logic in the U.S. Government providing loans, direct loans in many instances, guaranteed loans and grants to people in foreign lands, foreign governments? Why help them, when there is no room at the inn for American steelworkers? 
   Think of it. I would be ashamed--ashamed--to deny our own people when we do not deny foreign governments. I have a list of the direct loans. I have a list of the guaranteed loans. I have a list of the outstanding loans to foreign governments. And then a Senator will stand in this Chamber and vote against guaranteed loans for an American industry, the steel industry, steelworkers, steel families. I know some Senators do not like to hear it, but listen to me. If you do not hear me, you will hear from them, the people for whom there is no room at the inn. 
   Opponents of this loan guarantee program would have us believe that this is an excessively costly solution to a nonexistent problem. It is neither. The loan guarantee program outlined in this bill would provide qualified steel producers access to loans through the private market that are guaranteed by the federal government in the same way that the federal government now guarantees loans made to homebuilders, farmers, even foreign governments. These guarantees are needed because banks, seeing the same flood of low-priced imported steel, are not willing to make loans or restructure existing debt when their collateral--the steel made and sold by the borrowers--is so devalued. both the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget, acting under the credit reform provisions of the Budget Enforcement Act, have calculated the budget authority estimates of this program at only $140 million, reflective of the fairly low risk of default and the value of the potential collateral to be offered. This cost, as has been stated time and again, is fully offset. 
   The steel loan guarantee program will be established and administered by a distinguished board of directors--namely, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Commerce, who will serve as chairman of the board. This board will be given flexibility to determine the percentage of the federal guarantee, the appropriate collateral, as well as the loan amounts and interest rates. 
   This board will disburse loans of not less than $25 million, subject to a waiver, and not more than $250 million to any one company, and the total amount of all guarantees will not exceed $1 billion. As the loans are paid off, funds will become available for additional lending. All loans, however, must be repaid within 6 years, with interest. 
   This loan guarantee program is GATT-legal. We are still playing fair. We are not subsidizing our steel industry. We are not undermining someone else's domestic steel industry by dumping steel at below production cots. This program would operate within the international trade rules. 
   This emergency loan guarantee program is an important tool to help these companies deal with the immediate effects of this crisis as they pursue their legal cases and as other legislative remedies are being considered. By itself, this program will not solve this crisis, but it is needed to ensure that these companies can make it through some very tough times and keep their employees--our fellow citizens--working. 
   Which of you, the Scriptures say, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Which of you, being a father, if your son asks for fish, will give him a serpent? Which of you, if your son asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? 
   When I say to Senators, these steelworkers are our fellow Americans, our fellow citizens, they are asking for the opportunity to earn their daily bread, in the sweat of their brow, are we going to give them a stone? 
   So, what do we have to lose here by ensuring that funding is available for a crisis that our own Department of Commerce verifies is upon us? If the money is not needed, not one red cent will be dispersed from the Treasury. But if we do not act, and steel companies start to go under, you can bet that we will not be able to act quickly enough to save some of those companies, some of those jobs, and some of those steel towns that will be pulled under by the rip current of our failure to respond. 
   It cost us at most $140 million to act decisively now to avert a crisis that is within our shores. Our failure to act will surely cost us much more as a nation. I speak not only of the tangible costs of inaction--in increased unemployment, cuts in services, and bank losses, in addition to increased spending for welfare, food stamps, Medicaid, housing assistance, child care assistance, community adjustment assistance, worker adjustment assistance, and so forth, but also of the intangible costs. What does it mean if we let our steel industry fail? What does it mean if we allow it to be sliced away mill by mill by mill until only the biggest survive? What does it mean for our future to have another critical defense component delivered from a ship arriving from distant shores? Ships from distant shores will bring the steel. Can our space launch capacity be held hostage to specialty materials and components produced overseas? Can a new stealth bomber still be produced without a foreign partner? 
   What does it mean when we let trade theory or consideration for foreign trading partners allow us to tie our own hands and let foreign competitors unfairly or illegally pull the rug out from under American citizens? Should American steelworkers and their families go on unemployment or even welfare in order to allow foreign steelworkers to retain their jobs? I do not think so. 
   I think our people should come first, as far as I am concerned. This country has been very charitable to the rest of the world. This Nation has helped other nations when disasters came upon them. This Nation has helped other nations to rebuild after destructive wars. But we should not ask this Nation to give up its industries and ship those industries overseas. We should not ask our steelworkers to give up their jobs in order that steelworkers somewhere else, thousands of miles away, across the deep waters, may have their jobs. 
   The people who send us here place a trust in us. Those who send us here can bring us back home. They ought to bring us home if we do not listen to their pleas. They place a trust in us that we will stand for issues important to them, their lives, and their livelihood. 
   I cannot, in good conscience, turn my back on America's steelworkers, just as I cannot turn my back on the oil and gas workers. And I cannot turn my back on the farmers in this country. But I hope that each of you will not turn your back on our steelworkers. The time will come when you may come to my door, saying: I need your help. I may have that rollcall on how you voted when the steelworkers needed your help, when their families needed your help in order that they might have bread to eat, clothes to wear, and the other necessities of life. Let's not forget we have to help one another. 
   The questions for every Member of Congress are these: do we care if we have a domestic steel industry? Does it matter? Or should we throw in the towel and allow foreign competitors to chip away at our steel industry until we are forced to depend on foreign steelmakers for our every steel need in the next century? Let us not dither. Let us not believe there is no problem here. Let us not play politics. 
   Let's leave philosophy to Socrates and to Plato and the other great philosophers. Let's tend to things closer to home. Let us act. I urge the adoption of this legislation. 
   My colleague, my friend, PETE DOMENICI, who is on the floor at the moment, who represents the great State of New Mexico, will speak for oil and gas. I fully support him--fully support him. What affects his oil and gas  industries affects me and my people, affects West Virginia. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. As the distinguished Senator from Alaska will recall, I voted with him previously. But as I explained earlier today, had we amended this bill with a nongermane amendment, it would have killed the iron and the oil and gas guarantee bill. It would have been dead. Because the Speaker made no commitment to help bring up a bill that would have other matters included in it. He only made his commitment with regard to the iron and oil and gas guarantee. So I thank the Senator. 
   I had to vote against the Senator from Alaska on this occasion because I wanted to save the bill before the Senate.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in little more that six months time, each and every American is going to be impacted by one of the simplest, yet most complex technological problems we have ever faced. The so-called Y2K computer problem--simple to understand, but enormously complex in terms of its solution--has the potential to adversely affect every facet of our lives. Yet, while no one can say with absolute certainty what consequences will flow from the new year, there is one thing our litigious nation can be sure of: Come January 1st, many Americans will seek redress in our nation's courtrooms. 
   At the very time when businesses will need to focus their attention on mending computer problems and helping others deal with service disruptions, too many companies will, unfortunately, find themselves distracted from that important task by the threat of legal action. Equally troubling is the possibility of hundreds of thousands of law suits being brought in a matter of weeks or months; a situation which could simply overwhelm our judicial system. 
   Consequently, I am concerned that, unless we act now, our legal system may not be able to adequately address the ramifications of the new year in an efficient, fair, and effective manner. But beyond the courthouse doors, I am also deeply concerned about the potential long-term effect on our nation's computer industry. 
   Mr. President, a generation ago, the United States was the world's preeminent producer of manufactured goods. At one time, we were unrivaled in our construction of automobiles, aircraft, consumer electronics, communications equipment including satellite technology, and steel, to name but a few. For various reasons, though, we have lost our dominant position in each of these important areas. No longer do foreign companies immediately look to the U.S. when seeking to purchase an airplane or a role of steel. And no longer do consumers around the world automatically purchase an American-made television, an American-made radio or an American-made camera. Those days are gone. 
   Yet, despite that circumstance, unsettling as it may be, the fact remains that the United States is predominate in the world of computers and computer technology. Companies such as IBM, Microsoft, Intel, and Compaq, are household names around the world, and for good reason. They, among many others, are American success stories that have produced enormous benefits to our nation's economy and provided our workers with good, high-paying jobs. 
   Like many of my colleagues, I am troubled by the fact that some small businesses may suffer as a result of a Y2K failure. But it also troubles me to think that we may be on the verge of litigating our computer industry into submission. Where are we if, in our zeal to place blame, we cripple these corporate entities, some of which may be big and rich, but most of which are small? And how do we preserve what may be our last industrial stronghold if we are willing to treat the overwhelming majority of these companies, which have worked diligently and in good faith, the same way we treat those few unscrupulous firms that do not wish to accept their responsibilities? I believe that the protections afforded small business in the bill, while not as I would have written them, are adequate. 
   We must acknowledge that what is at stake here is of enormous long-term importance to the economic well-being of every American. Each of us has a duty to ensure that our technological and industrial base flourishes, not just in the coming months, but for decades. In weighing those factors, I sincerely hope that my colleagues will come to the same conclusion as I and support this legislation for the good of our economy, our workers, and our nation.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for his insistence upon order. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture on this bill and to vote for the bill. I am going to direct my remarks to that portion of the bill, insofar as I can in this brief period, that deals with the steel loan guarantee. Mr. DOMENICI and others will speak about the similar oil and gas loan guarantee. 
   There is a real need for this legislation, for this assistance to American firms and to American workers, and that need is now. A crisis does exist in our own steel industry. The illegal dumping of below-cost steel into our country is real. 
   Our domestic steel industry has been seeking remedy through antidumping and countervailing trade cases. The Commerce Department tells us these cases are being considered, but it takes  time. Opponents of this loan guarantee program would have us believe this is an excessively costly solution to a nonexistent problem. It is neither. The loan guarantee program outlined in this bill would provide qualified steel producers access to loans through the private market that are guaranteed by the Federal Government in the same way the Federal Government now guarantees loans made to homebuilders, farmers, even foreign nations such as Mexico, Israel, and Russia. It sets no precedent. Similar programs have been successfully implemented for New York City, Lockheed, and Chrysler. 
   Both the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget have calculated the budget authority estimates of this program at $140 million, reflective of the fairly low risk of default and the value of the potential collateral to be offered. This cost is fully offset. I want to stress that. This cost is fully offset. The total amount of all guarantees will not exceed $1 billion. All loans must be repaid within 6 years with interest. The program also contains a funding mechanism for the borrowers to pay for the cost of administering the program. Importantly, this loan guarantee program is GATT legal. We are still playing fair. We are not subsidizing our steel industry. 
   I respect those who will oppose this measure. But let me ask this question: Are we going to ship another U.S. industry overseas? We have already shipped the shoe industry, the leather industry, the pottery industry, the textile industry and other industries. Are we going to ship another U.S. industry overseas, the steel industry this time? Are we going to allow foreign entities to make ghost towns of our steel-dependent communities? 
   These are loan guarantees, similar to the guarantees we have provided for all manner of national endeavors in the past whenever it was in our national interests to do so. We have provided such guarantees to foreign nations as well whenever we deemed it to be necessary and beneficial to our international interests. I am not against doing that, if it is in our national interests. This bill is a short-term helping hand to a vital American industry which is being severely damaged by illegal--illegal--foreign dumping. Can we not act here to stand up for American businesses and for American workers? This is a pro-American-business vote as well as a pro-American-jobs vote. 
   We have already lost 10,000 jobs in the U.S. steel industry since last November. How many more must we lose before we act? When we continue to lose these industries and these jobs, are you going to explain it on the basis that you voted against cloture? Good luck!

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last afternoon, Senator STEVENS cast his 12,000th rollcall vote. Many of my colleagues joined in commending Senator STEVENS on this very worthwhile and considerable accomplishment. I was not on the floor at that time. Today, I join in commending Senator STEVENS on having cast his 12,000th vote. 
   Since arriving in the U.S. Senate on December 24, 1968, Senator STEVENS has worked tirelessly on matters relating to defense and national security. Having served in World War II, as a pilot in the China-Burma-India theater, Senator STEVENS was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross twice, two air medals, and the Yuan Hai medal awarded by the Republic of China. 
   He joined the Appropriations Committee on February 23, 1972, and 3 years later he began service on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, where he has served continuously since that time, and served with great distinction. Since he became chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee in 1981, Senator STEVENS has served either as chairman or ranking member of that vitally important subcommittee. As of January 1997, Senator STEVENS assumed additional responsibilities that come with being named chairman of the Committee on Appropriations. 
   I have worked by his side on many, many occasions on subcommittees, particularly on the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee. I have served with him on matters that have come before the Committee on Appropriations, where I now serve as his 
   ranking member. In addition, for many years, I have been privileged to have the honor of serving with Senator STEVENS on the Arms Control Observer Group, as well as on the British-American Parliamentary Group. 
   Senator STEVENS works indefatigably to ensure that his State of Alaska receives appropriate consideration in all matters that come before the Senate. He does that work and does it well. The people of Alaska can be preeminently proud of the service that their Senator, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee of the Senate, performs. He works for Alaska every day, and he works for the Nation every day. 
   Not only do I consider him one of the most distinguished and one of the most capable Senators with whom I have served in more than 41 years now, I also count him as a dear and trusted friend. I was in the Middle East when TED STEVENS was in the airplane crash in which he lost his wife, and I called him from the plane in which I was flying in the Middle East on that occasion. He was in the hospital. I talked with him and, of course, I was glad that he had survived the tragic accident.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I send two amendments to the desk and ask for their immediate consideration. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-byrd-wv-2-19990608</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk. 
   The Department of Defense operates over two million separate computers and 25,000 distinct computer systems to conduct its mission. These computer systems are integral parts of a wide variety of Department of Defense (DOD) programs. Many of these programs are critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions; but other vital activities also affected include command and control, satellites, inventory and transportation management, medical equipment, payment of checks, and personnel records. 
   The Department is now becoming aware that attacks on these systems may be capable of significantly affecting our military power, just as surely as a direct physical assault. Experience with ``hackers'' and DOD exercises indicate that defense systems, often globally-linked and readily-accessed, are vulnerable to unauthorized penetration of their information networks. Newspapers have been filled with reports in recent days about ``hackers'' attacking the web sites of the FBI, the White House, the Department of Interior, and even the Senate. 
   For example, I am told that by using unsophisticated ``hacker tools,'' intruders are able to crack systems passwords, establish super-user status (network control), search for and turn on microphones or cameras on personal computers connected to the installation campus area network. Hackers may then capture intra-office conversations and live video and download it to their computers. A simple test of the microphone sensitivity revealed low-level conversations were easily heard from roughly thirty feet away. This is particulary critical in areas where classified and sensitive information is stored and discussed. 
   The compelling need for controlling access to our Nation's vital information networks through computers becomes immediately evident when one considers just one battlefield scenario--the possibility that one of our important command and control outposts on the ground is overrun by hostile forces. Just imagine what leverage that would provide to a computer-sophisticated enemy. And, I am told that the Department has learned from its experience in Kosovo that this kind of a threat is not limited to major world powers. 
   At the present time, the basic process the Department relies upon to protect its computer systems are some kind of card and/or passwords including random characters. Users often are required to have several such cards or passwords in connection with their work. This approach to information security has some serious drawbacks for the long run. Passwords can be forgotten, shared, or observed, and cards can  be lost, stolen, or duplicated. Moreover, as the need for even more security grows with advancing technology, the situation will become more cumbersome and less effective. On the other hand, more sophisticated means are expected to become available to make unwanted intrusions, necessitating even more complex password and card systems. 
   There is an emerging technology available to the Department that promises to provide a more effective information security system, and that is biometrics. Almost everyone is familiar with fingerprints. Fingerprints are a biometric signature. Others are voice, face recognition, the iris of the eye, and keystroke dynamics or typing patterns; and I understand there are others as well. With this approach, access to a particular computer or network of computers is controlled by comparing one or several biometric signatures of the person asking to use the machine, with a template on file in a central location that contains the biometric identification of the authorized user of that computer. There is no card. There is no password. The test is whether the potential user is who he or she claims to be. The system authenticates a claimed identity from previously enrolled patterns or distinguishable traits. I understand that in the commercial world there are some examples of biometric identification already in use. Some ATM machines, for instance, now rely on iris signatures to permit access rather than the familiar card we all carry. 
   The Army has a particular interest in developing an effective control over the access to its information systems through computers, because of the far flung nature of its forces, and because its battle systems are becoming increasingly dependent on information networks. 
   This bill already includes $5.0 million in the Other Procurement, Army, appropriation for an initial biometrics computer information assurance system prototype project. I understand that the Army has exhibited strong leadership in the exploration and development of technologies in the biometrics arena, and is a natural leading candidate to be considered as the executive agent in this work for the Department of Defense and perhaps the federal government. The amendment I am offering is intended to respond to the immediacy of the critical information assurance requirement of the Army, and to build on the Army's leadership role in biometrics technology. The amendment also builds on the biometrics prototype project to explore a more focused and synergistic effort to develop information assurance technology. Finally, it also builds on and anticipates a working relationship with the Criminal Justice Information Services Division of the FBI, which houses and operates the world's finest single biometric data base--fingerprints. Specifically, my amendment provides an additional $10.0 million for an immediate assessment of biometrics sensors and templates repository requirements, and for combining and consolidating biometrics security technology and other information assurance technologies to accomplish a more focused and effective information assurance effort.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I believe the Joint Computer-Aided Acquisition and Logistics Support, JCALS, program is one of the most successful joint defense programs in the information technology area. It was begun in 1991 to automate the acquisition and logistics processes that support the Defense Department's weapon systems--  to provide a paperless acquisition and procurement process across all major defense agencies and commands. For example, at the Defense Logistics Agency, the Electronic Folderization Contract used to require 126 tons of paper and 100 days for an acquisition cycle. As a direct result of JCALS, the process is now paperless and the acquisition cycle takes just 15 days. The DOD estimates that JCALS will save $2.3 billion through 2014 just by digitizing documents that now are prepared in paper form. 
   Is my understanding correct that the FY 2000 Defense Appropriations bill now before the Senate contains the President's budget request of $154.1 million for JCALS, with $121.8 million in the Army Operations and Maintenance account and $32.3 million in the Army Other Procurement account?

I am advised that to the maximum extent practicable, the contractor plans to use these funds in Hinton, West Virginia, to further develop JCALS capabilities to support weapons systems.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I commend the able managers of this bill, Senator STEVENS and Senator INOUYE, for producing a balanced and comprehensive bill that addresses some of the most pressing needs of the U.S. military. 
   Together with the emergency supplemental spending bill that Congress sent to the President last month, and the Defense authorization bill that the Senate passed prior to Memorial Day, this Defense appropriations bill marks a major commitment to our men and women in uniform by funding a wide array of vital defense programs. In acting quickly and decisively on these three bills, the Senate has sent a strong message of support to the military, particularly to those forces currently engaged in the air war over Yugoslavia. That support is richly deserved. Once again, America's military forces have demonstrated their superior skills and leadership in the Balkan conflict. We are indebted to them for their service and dedication to their country. 
   This appropriations bill represents a strong effort on the part of the managers to balance the very real needs of the Defense Department against the pressing needs of other domestic programs in the budget. This is a tough year for the appropriators. We are working under very tight budget caps to meet a whole host of escalating infrastructure needs--both physical and human--in this nation. Senator STEVENS was able to trim slightly more than $3 billion from defense spending to allocate to other programs without damaging the integrity of this bill. Even so, it will be difficult to pass all 13 appropriations bills for Fiscal Year  2000 within the constraints of the current budget caps. I do not know what the resolution to this problem will be, but I commend Senator STEVENS for the steps he has taken so far, and I look forward to working with him on the remaining appropriations bills.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the United States is engaged in a dangerous air war against Yugoslavia. More than 30,000 members of the U.S. military have been deployed to the Balkans to prosecute this campaign. While we read the latest news from the front every morning in the comfort of our homes and offices, American men and women in uniform are living the harrowing details day in and day out. 
   It is fitting that the Senate, in the midst of this conflict, enact without delay the National Defense Authorization Bill. This bill-- which includes a significant pay raise for the military as well as a healthy increase in funding intended to improve military readiness--sends a strong signal of support to the men and women of the United States military, and to their families. 
   I commend Senator WARNER, the new and capable Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Senator LEVIN, the able ranking minority member, for their leadership in producing an excellent bill. This legislation bears testament to the skills and willingness of both of these distinguished Senators to craft meaningful policy decisions in the context of bipartisan consensus. 
   Earlier this week, the Senate Appropriations Committee, of which I am the ranking member, approved a Defense Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2000 that goes hand-in-glove with this measure. Last week, Congress sent to the President an emergency supplemental appropriations bill to fund the Kosovo operation. Together, these bills take great strides toward giving our military forces the tools that they need and the support that they deserve to protect the national security of the United States and to execute the military's many critical missions both at home and overseas. 
   While the air war over Yugoslavia is on the front pages of the newspapers every day, we must never forget that behind the headlines, scores of other U.S. forces are engaged in difficult, and often dangerous, missions around the globe. From the peacekeeping patrols in Bosnia to the dangerous skies over Iraq to the tense border between North and South Korea, U.S. military personnel face the potential peril of combat every day. Resources have been stretched thin while operating tempos are constantly being accelerated. These are difficult times for the military, and I salute the dedication of the men and women who serve their nation so diligently. These are the individuals who stake their very lives on the policies and programs that we debate here in the Senate. These are the individuals to whom we must dedicate our best legislative efforts. 
   Mr. President, this bill delivers the goods. It includes a 4.8 percent pay raise for the military, and it restores full retirement benefits to service members. It adds more than $1.2 billion to the nuts-and-bolts readiness accounts--base operations, infrastructure repairs, training, and ammunition--that are so vitally needed to improve the long term readiness of the armed forces. It funds the purchase of essential equipment and weapons systems. And, through the efforts of the newly  established and forward looking Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, on which I am pleased to serve, it invests in programs to combat the ever increasing threat to the United States of terrorist attack, information warfare, and chemical and biological weapons. 
   Mr. President, we cannot put a price on the sacrifices and contributions of our military, but we can make sure that the best fighting forces in the world have the necessary tools of their trade. That is the purpose of this bill. We are sending a message to the troops that we have heard their concerns and we have responded to them. I urge the Senate to move quickly to pass this legislation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have listened carefully to the debate on this amendment, and I appreciate the wrenching emotion that has motivated those on both sides of this issue. 
   The NATO operation in Kosovo is a difficult issue for many of us to come to terms with. Our hearts ache for the suffering of the Kosovar Albanians who have been banished from their homeland by the forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. At the same time, we fear for the safety of U.S. and NATO military forces who are engaged in a perilous mission in a corner of the world that has been torn by ethnic conflict for centuries. 
   We cannot foresee the outcome of this operation. We have a duty to watch it carefully, to debate it fully on the floor of this Senate. But in our concern to do what is right, we should not act in so much haste that we run the risk of making a fatal mistake. 
   There may come a day when I will stand on the floor of the U.S. Senate with the Senator from New Hampshire and call for a cutoff to the funding of U.S. operations in Kosovo. But that day is not today. That time is not now. A decision of that magnitude must not be taken on the run, after a hastily called 60-minute debate among a handful of Senators. 
   Mr. President, this amendment sends the wrong message at the wrong time. By all means, let us debate the U.S. involvement in Kosovo. But let us do it with deliberation and forethought. I urge the Senate to table this amendment.

   Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. 
   Mr. President, the distinguished ranking member, Mr. LEVIN, knew my position on this matter, but he accommodated me by suggesting that I might proceed at this time while he is away from his chair. I thank the distinguished Senator from Texas for yielding time to me. 
   I am strongly opposed to the inclusion of section 806 in the fiscal year 2000 Defense authorization bill. This section would substantially undermine Federal Prison Industries--the Bureau of Prisons' most important skill-developing program for inmates. 
   I believe that this matter should not be included in the defense authorization bill. It is a matter that is being considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee. I am advised that the Criminal Justice Oversight Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by the senior Senator from South Carolina, Mr. THURMOND, conducted an oversight hearing on this matter on May 24--yesterday. 
   The Attorney General of the United States, in a letter addressed to the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has indicated that she is concerned about this legislative provision. The Attorney General's letter asserts that the legislative provision would have a negative impact on Federal Prison Industries,  
   ..... which is the Bureau of Prisons' most important, efficient, and cost-effective tool for managing inmates and for preparing them to be productive, law-abiding citizens upon release from prison.  
   I am also advised that the administration has taken a strong position in opposition to section 806 because of the harm it would do to the FPI program, which is fundamental to the security in Federal prisons. The administration believes that to ensure Federal inmates are employed in sufficient numbers, the current mandatory source requirement should not be altered until an effective alternative program is designed and put into place. 
   Mr. President, in the State of West Virginia there are three Federal prisons--the Federal prison at Alderson, the Robert C. Byrd Federal Correctional Institution at Beckley, and the Robert F. Kennedy Prison at Morgantown. And each of these has an FPI operation. At these three Federal prisons alone, the Bureau of Prisons is able to keep more than 500 inmates productively occupied, and employ nearly 40 staff at no cost to the taxpayer. How about that! That sounds like a good deal to me. 
   Mr. President, a somewhat similar amendment was offered to the Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 1998. The Senate instead adopted a substitute amendment offered by the distinguished senior Senator from Texas (Mr. GRAMM), which required a joint study by the Department of Defense and FPI on this matter. That study has recently been completed and transmitted to the Senate Armed Services Committee. The joint study made several recommendations that could be accomplished within existing authority, without requiring legislative action. 
   In summary, I am opposed to section 806 to the Defense authorization bill because it is unwarranted, and not only is it unwarranted, but it would have a debilitating effect on Federal Prisons Industries. This is a matter within the jurisdiction of the Senate Judiciary Committee and should not be included in this bill.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Alaska, the senior Senator, Mr. TED STEVENS, the manager of the bill and the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He is my longtime friend. I have served many, many years in the Senate and on the Appropriations Committee and on various subcommittees of the Appropriations Committee with Senator STEVENS. 
   He was fair and he was dedicated to the positions of the Senate throughout the discussions on the supplemental appropriations bill when it was in conference with the other body. He stood up for the Senate's positions, and he was remarkably effective. I am proud to associate myself with him. First of all, he is a gentleman. His word is his bond. His handshake is his bond. I like that. 
   He is not so partisan that partisanship overrides everything else. We are all partisan here to an extent, but to some of us party is not everything, party is not even the top thing. Party is important, but there are other things even more important.  
   Mr. President, I intend to support this emergency supplemental conference report accompanying H.R. 1141. It is the result of a long and difficult conference with the House of Representatives. There are a number of matters in this agreement that I do not support, and there is one provision which is not included in the agreement but which I believe was as deserving as any emergency contained in the conference agreement. 
   That provision is the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program. Senators will recall that the Senate substitute to H.R. 1141 included the amendment that I offered to establish a 2-year $1 billion loan guarantee program to assist the more than 10,000 U.S. steelworkers who have already lost their jobs as a result of a huge influx of cheap and illegally dumped steel during 1998, last year. 
   This matter had strong support by the Senate conferees during the House-Senate conference. After a thorough discussion of the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program, the House conferees voted to accept this Senate provision. Not all of the House conferees. All the House Democratic conferees and three of the Republican conferees voted to accept this provision. However, that vote was subsequently overturned the next day, and the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program remained a matter of contention until the very end of the conference. 
   In order to expedite the completion of this very important emergency bill, not everything which I support in the Senate, but I am going to support the bill, and because of the need to get it to the President as quickly as possible, I agreed to drop the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program in return for a commitment from the House and Senate congressional leadership that this loan guarantee provision would be brought up as a freestanding emergency appropriations bill in the very near future. 
   Pursuant to that agreement, I hope and expect that such an appropriations bill will be brought up in the Senate prior to the upcoming Memorial Day recess. I hope, because it is vitally important, that we act expeditiously, this being a real emergency. 
   The plight of many of the steel companies in this country is serious. The Speaker of the House has agreed to permit a motion to go to conference within 1 week of receiving the Senate-passed bill and has agreed to allow normal appropriations conferees to be appointed and to permit the resulting conference report to be brought up before the Houses. 
   Subsequent to Senate adoption of the substitute on H.R. 1141, the House Appropriations Committee marked up a second emergency supplemental appropriations bill to provide emergency funding principally to support the military operations, refugee relief, and humanitarian assistance relating to the conflict in Kosovo 
   and for military operations in Southwest Asia for fiscal year 1999. 
   In light of the House action in relation to the Kosovo supplemental, and in hopes of being able to move both the Central American emergency spending bill, H.R. 1141, as well as the emergency funding for Kosovo, it was determined by the joint leadership that the Kosovo funding should be taken up directly by the House-Senate conferees on H.R. 1141. As a consequence, the Senate Appropriations Committee never marked up the funding measure for Kosovo, nor did the Senate have an opportunity to debate that measure at all--no opportunity to amend it, no opportunity to debate it, no opportunity to vote it up or down. In other words, the first time the Kosovo funding has been before the Senate is today in the form of this conference agreement on H.R. 1141. 
   I generally do not support the handling of appropriations matters in a manner that does not allow the Senate to work its will on each of the issues in appropriations bills, but in this instance, I agreed to allow this procedure to be followed because of the importance of the matters contained in this particular conference report. 
   This conference agreement contains appropriations totaling some $15 billion, of which $10.9 billion is for the support of our men and women in uniform in Kosovo and Southwest Asia and $1.1 billion is for Kosovo-related humanitarian assistance. These amounts represent an increase of $6 billion--$6 billion--above the President's request for Kosovo-related appropriations. The $6 billion in emergency funding above the President's request contains a congressional emergency designation, but will only be available for obligation if the President agrees with that emergency designation, only if the President also requests these funds and declares them emergency spending. 
   In addition to the $12 billion for our Kosovo-related expenditures, both in military and humanitarian assistance, the pending measure also includes $574 million in emergency agriculture assistance programs, some $420 million higher than the administration's request. For the victims of Hurricane Mitch in Central America and the Caribbean, the conference agreement includes $983 million, of which $216 million is to replenish Department of Justice operation and maintenance accounts which were used to provide immediate relief to the hurricane victims. Finally, the agreement contains $900 million in emergency funding for FEMA in order to address the needs of the American people who suffered from the recent tornadoes in Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and Tennessee. 
    Mr. President, as I have stated, this was a very difficult conference that consumed many days and late nights to reach agreement. This was the first time that the present chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Mr. BILL YOUNG of Florida, had an opportunity to serve as chairman of the conference. I must say that he performed his responsibilities very capably. During the many contentious debates that took place, he was always fair and evenhanded and respectful of all members of the conference, just like our own chairman, Senator STEVENS. Yet, at the same time, he displayed the necessary firmness in order to keep the conference moving toward completion. So, I compliment Chairman BILL YOUNG for his excellent work on this difficult conference. 
   Let me again compliment Senator STEVENS, but also I compliment the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, Mr. DAVID OBEY, whom one will never find asleep at the switch. He is always there. He is always alert, combative enough, to be sure, and loyal to his own body, the House of Representatives, and the Democrats whom he represented in the conference. His work is always effective and very capable. 
   In closing, let me again say that Chairman STEVENS stoutly defended the Senate position on all of the matters throughout the conference and also made certain that all Senate conferees were able to express their view on each of the issues. 
   I hope that the Senate will support the conference report. As I say, there are some things in it I do not like, some things that were left out of it that I very much wanted and believe in and believe constitute as much of an emergency as some of the other items that are designated as such in the conference report. But I want to support this. I urge all Senators to support it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Because Senator MOYNIHAN is truly a man of eloquence and wit and vision and grace. We are going to miss him. He has been a powerful influence in this Senate. He has served in the executive branch, served with brilliance and with honor. And, like Christopher Wren--``if you would see his monument, look about you''--Senator MOYNIHAN leaves many monuments. Perhaps the greatest monument of all is that mark he has left upon the hearts of his colleagues who will miss  him and his powerful influence, his wisdom, his vision, when he has left this Senate. 
   I congratulate the Senator on offering this resolution. I will be very grateful if he will allow me to be a cosponsor. It is one of the least things I can do to honor my colleague, one whom I love, one whom I revere, one whom I respect, and one who has shown himself to be a leader in this Senate. 
   I thank the Senator.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I regret that, earlier today, I was compelled to vote against the Majority Leader's cloture motion with respect to S. 96, the Y2K litigation reform bill. I did so, however, for the simple reason that I believe it is vitally important that the Senate first complete its business on the juvenile justice bill before moving on to other business. We are on the verge of finishing our work on this much-needed legislation, and it would have been, in my opinion, a grotesque waste of time and effort to simply throw that away in some artificial rush to proceed to the Y2K bill. Despite my vote, I look forward to having the opportunity to turn our attention to the Y2K litigation problem as soon as we have finished our work on the issue of youth crime and violence.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this proposal by Senator KOHL and myself simply authorizes the attorney general of a State to go into Federal district court and seek an injunction against any person importing alcohol into that State in violation of that State's law. Unfortunately, recent Federal court decisions have held that States do not necessarily have the power to seek such an injunction despite the fact that the 21st amendment to the Constitution and the Webb-Kenyon Act give States the power to prohibit alcohol importation. As a consequence, many States are at a loss when it comes to enforcing their own laws. 
   For those who may have concerns with this proposal, let me state unequivocally that the amendment will not restrict the lawful manufacture, advertisement, sale, transportation, or importation of any alcoholic beverage. As long as a distiller, or a brewer, or a winemaker complies with the laws of the given State, they will have no additional restrictions placed upon them by this amendment. The only ones who need to fear this amendment are those who are conducting their business in an unlawful manner, particularly those who are willing to sell alcohol to our children. 
   Mr. President, as the Senate considers this juvenile justice bill, designed to reduce the scourge of youth violence and crime, I beseech my colleagues to remember that alcohol use and abuse constitute an important facet of this national problem. Let us not overlook the pernicious effects that alcohol has on our young people. Let us not turn our backs on them by foregoing this opportunity to put a stop to those who choose to evade our laws. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I have scoured the newspapers in recent days in an effort to begin to unravel the pieces of the puzzle that led two young teenage boys to commit such senseless atrocity at Columbine High School. It is long past time to stop wringing our hands over this issue of school violence. We can no longer afford to sit idly by, watching our nation's schools being infiltrated by hoodlums and hate groups more concerned with converting schools into places of fear than maintaining them as havens of learning and enlightenment. This Congress and the American people must join forces and take action now to protect our young. 
   Now, that is very easy to say--very easy to say. And I think everyone would agree on that, that they must join forces. We must find ways to restore discipline. Now, that is a little tougher. That is a little harder to bring about. We must find ways to restore discipline. 
   The ancient Romans practiced discipline. And it began in the home where the children were taught to venerate their ancestors, to respect their gods. They were pagan gods, but nevertheless they were the gods of the Romans. And the young men and women in the homes were taught to revere their parents and to respect the law. Each Roman believed that the gods had designed a destiny for Rome. And each Roman believed that it was his duty to help bring about the fulfillment of that destiny which the gods had designed for the Roman state. That discipline overflowed from the home and into the Roman legions, and it was in great part because of that iron discipline that the Roman legions were enabled to conquer all of the nations around the Mediterranean Sea and to subjugate them. It was that discipline that was first learned at the hearth, in the family circle, in the home. That is where it has to start today. That is exactly where it has to begin today--in the homes. 
   We must instill in our children basic values and provide them with the knowledge and the skills to confront the many demands that are placed upon our society. We must prevent, if we can, a recurrence of these ruthless slaughters that continue to rock the institutional base of our Nation's education system.  
   It is now time to do what we can. I am only one, but I am one. I cannot do everything, but I can do something. And what I can do, by the grace of God I intend to do. 
   It is time to do what we can do, and to search out additional avenues that will return peace and tranquility to our schools and our society. So, today, I heed my words, and come to this hallowed chamber to take an essential step forward in this unfolding national debate by joining with my colleagues Senator LIEBERMAN and Senator MCCAIN to call for the convening of a National Commission on Youth Violence. 
   I know we appoint lots of commissions. I spoke of the Romans a while ago. So did they; they appointed commissions. I make mention of the Romans many times. Of course, I could speak of our English forebears as well. But I mention the Romans because Montesquieu thought that the ancient Romans were a unique people. The framers were acquainted with Montesquieu. He admired the ancient Romans so much that he wrote a history of the ancient Romans. It was back several years ago, when we were discussing the line-item veto, I thought that, inasmuch as Montesquieu had studied with thoroughness the ancient Romans, I would do the same. And it was there that he learned about checks and balances, and separation of powers--in his study of the Romans. So they appointed commissions as well. 
   This amendment, which I am pleased to learn has been accepted into the managers' package, focuses on the formidable challenge of identifying and reconciling the root causes, the underlying motives, and the influences fueling this widening streak of lawlessness plaguing the heart and soul of America. 
   By gathering together men and women of the highest caliber of expertise in law enforcement, school administration, child and adolescent psychology, parenting and family studies, we call upon all parties--all parties--to listen and learn, galvanizing a true national discussion on school safety. This National Commission will seek difficult answers to some difficult questions--What drives children to commit such violence? 
   When I was a little boy and when I was a young man, we never heard of such violence. We would never have thought of carrying a gun to school. 
   The most outrageous thing I ever did in school back in that little two-room school--I was always glad when the teacher appointed me as one of the two boys who would go over the hill to the spring house and bring back to the school a bucket of water, out of which we all drank. We all drank out of the same bucket and with the same dipper. One day, I decided to put a few tadpoles in my pocket and put those tadpoles on the desk of one of the little girl classmates. Well, I thought it was funny, but when the teacher got through with me, it wasn't so funny. She didn't think it was funny. 
   On another occasion, when I was in high school, I was asked by one of my teachers, whose name was Margaret McKone, a question. I said, ``Huh?'' And I went on reading at my desk. I was not aware of the fact that she walked to the back of the room, came up the aisle, and had gotten just level with me until she slammed me in the face with a hard smack of her hand. I can feel it still, and I can feel the embarrassment that went along with it. She said, ``ROBERT, don't you ever say `huh' to me again.'' I did not give her any back talk, and I never said ``huh'' to her again. 
   My old coal miner dad said: If you ever get a whipping in school, you will get another one when you get home. I knew something about his whippings. He started out with a hickory limb. Later, as I became a little older, he used a razor strap. 
   One day, we had a substitute teacher. We never thought of doing violence in school. Violence? Why, it wasn't allowed in our school. Nobody talked about violence. I took a piece of paper and I folded it and made myself a toy airplane. When I saw the teacher's back was turned--this was a substitute teacher, as I say--when the substitute teacher's back was 
   turned, I sailed that paper airplane across the room. 
   The teacher turned just in time to see the airplane still suspended in air and my outstretched hand. He said, ``ROBERT, come up here.'' He called me to the front of the class. He put a chair up there. He said, ``ROBERT, get up in that chair.'' He drew a circle on the blackboard and said, ``Stick your nose in the center of that circle.'' I did. When I did, there were resounding whacks on my posterior which I will never forget, after which I turned to my seat red faced amid the snickers of my classmates. They were somewhat veiled snickers, but I heard them. It was embarrassing. I got just what I asked for. 
   What would you think of the things some children are doing in school these days? They are not sailing paper airplanes. And up until a few years ago, we did not have these outrageous, violent crimes being committed by youngsters. 
   My old coal miner dad never bought me a cap buster at Christmastime. I was lucky to get an apple, or an orange, or a piece of candy. He never bought me a cap buster. He never bought me a cowboy suit. He always got me a drawing tablet or a watercolor set or a book. He taught me to learn. He urged me to learn so I would not have to work in the coal mine. 
   Those were the two people who raised me. They were religious people. They were not of the religious left, not of the religious right. They did not make a big whoop-de-doo over their religion, but they were religious. How did I know? Many times when the lights were out and in my early boyhood, the house was lighted by a kerosene lamp. We did not have any running water in the house, no electricity. But when the light was out, I would hear that great lady who raised me praying. I would hear her praying in another room. I knew she was on her knees. I had seen her many times on her knees. When my old coal miner dad left this world, he did not owe any man a penny. 
   They taught me to be honest, pay your debts, and work, work hard. It never hurt anybody. It may have killed John Henry, but that is about all I can recall. We were taught to work, to be honest, to revere our father and mother. The Bible says: Honor thy father and thy mother. We were taught to do that, not talk back. 
   Thank God I am one of those few Americans left who grew up in the Great Depression, who knows something about the Great Depression, who was in school during the Great Depression. 
   I was the coal mining community's scrap boy. I went around the coal town and gathered the scraps from the coal miners' tables and fed my dad's pigs. He always bought about 10 to 12 Poland China pigs. I would feed those pigs. I would gather the scraps year round. I was the village scrap boy. Some people called it the village ``slop boy,'' the town's ``slop boy.'' 
   When we were in school, we always had prayer every morning and pledged allegiance to the flag of the United States. I am the only Member of 535 Members of this Congress today who can say that I was here, in Congress, on June 7, 1954, when the House of Representatives voted to insert the words ``under God'' into the Pledge of Allegiance--``under God,'' on June 7, 1954. The Senate followed suit the next day, and on June 14 it became a law. 
   The first thing we did was have prayer. They do not do that these days. It did not hurt any of us. It was good for us. If there is anything about which I would amend the first amendment, it would be that. I am not above amending the Constitution, but I think we had better be very slow about it. 
   Don't do it very often, certainly. But that is one thing that I think would help, if the Nation returned to God first. 
   ``Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord. Bring up a child in the way that he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it.'' 
   When we parents are looking around wringing our hands and we politicians are looking around and wringing our hands saying, ``What should we do?'' let's return to some of the country's basics, the fundamentals that made this a great nation. 
   The Bible says remove not the ancient landmark which thy fathers have set. That is one of the old landmarks. We have gotten too far away, drifting too far from the shore. My friend from Alabama will remember that old hymn--drifting too far from the shore. 
   I will tell you, there is nothing wrong with this Nation that some old-time religion will not cure. It does not have to  be my religion; it does not have to be a Baptist; it does not have to be Methodist, Presbyterian, whatever--just a basic belief in a Creator. 
   Now, you might say: Well, Charles Darwin didn't believe that. You read his books. Read his books. He mentions the Creator in ``The Origin of Species.'' And in ``The Descent of Man,'' he said he made a mistake in ``The Origin of Species,'' he had exaggerated, he had gone too far. 
   We can pass all the laws that we can pass, all the laws we care to pass, but it has to start out in the home. In the home, that is where it begins. That is the root. 
   So what drives children to such violence? Why are students taking the lives of their classmates? How do we prevent future incidents like those at Columbine High School from recurring? I hope the commission can find some prescriptions for change as a result of these explorations. But perhaps, most important of all, the commission's mandate will serve as a catalyst for our Nation's parents, teachers, industry leaders, and their communities, to each--each; you, me; each; him, her; each--take responsibility in protecting our Nation's children. 
   One of the many charges delegated to the National Commission is an exploration of the ever-important role of school teachers and administrators in the lives of their students--school teachers. Part of the cure, I believe, lies in the need to restore basic discipline--basic discipline--to the classroom. 
   When I was a young boy, I attended to my lessons and I attended to my lessons. I threw a paper airplane once in a while, but I attended to my lessons. And in a two-room schoolhouse my teachers were my role models. I wanted to be the best in the algebra class; I wanted to be the best in the geometry class; I wanted to please my teacher, and I wanted to please that old couple who took me to raise. They were my role models. 
   I have met, in my long political career, with kings and shahs and princes and queens and Presidents and Governors and men and women of the highest station in this world, but one of the few great men whom I ever came to know was that old coal miner dad who raised me. He was a great man. I never heard him say God's name in vain in all the years I was with him--not once, not once. 
   So those teachers, along with my adoptive parents, taught me the so-called ``old values'' of integrity, honesty, respect, and loyalty that I carry with me to this very day. 
   Now, I am no paragon. I do not claim to be a paragon of rectitude or whatever, but, as Popeye used to say, I am what I am. My old dad and mom, they taught me to be what I am, and they taught me to believe in a higher power, taught me to believe in God. 
   Now, if parents ingrain that kind of teaching in the child, they may stray from the righteous path from time to time but they will come back, they will come back. 
   The classroom was a sacred precinct where a quiet and wholesome environment prevailed, and where students came to learn. They came to learn the fundamentals of math and science and grammar and literature and history. Discipline was expected and discipline was enforced. 
   And on that little report card that I took back home, there was one item, deportment--deportment. I was always careful that my dad would see a good mark in every category, and particularly in deportment. 
   When disorder broke out, as it did very rarely, the teacher had the authority and the command of the classroom to bring students to upright and full attention. 
   Mr. President, I know that it is easy to hear someone from my generation speaking of morals and values and the way things used to be and simply dismiss those words and sentiments as being old-fashioned or out of step with the world today. Well, in some things I do not want to be in step with the world today. Let the world go its way. But for the sake of our future, I think we can learn from our past. 
   Today, the discipline that we once knew has eroded to the point that students no longer resolve conflicts with words, but with weapons. The normal angst of adolescence has given way to anger and outright violence. As a consequence, we have teachers who fear the very environment in which they one day thrived, wondering whether they, too, might be caught in the line of fire. 
   I remember there was a class in agriculture when I was in school in Spanishburg, WV, may I say to the distinguished Senator from Missouri, who is presiding over the Senate today with a degree of dignity and skill that is so rare as a day in June. The teacher was talking about the potato and about the eyes of the potato. He called on me and asked me a question. I thought it would be funny if I said that the potato got dirt in its eyes. I thought that was kind of funny. And he said, ``ROBERT, stand up. Now, you apologize to the class for what you just said.'' See, I was making a little light of a serious matter. I thought I was being a kind of showoff, which I did not particularly try to do many times. But he said, ``You stand up and you apologize to the class.'' And I apologized to the class. 
   Mr. President, our teachers deserve the opportunity to teach just as our children deserve the opportunity to learn.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I would like to briefly explain my reasons for voting in favor of amendment No. 344, offered by Senators HATCH and CRAIG, to S. 254, the juvenile justice bill. I am extremely disappointed that the amendment does not close the loophole permitting sales of firearms at gun shows without background checks. I supported, and continue to support, the amendment offered by Senator LAUTENBERG, that would close the gun show loophole once and for all. I regret that the Hatch amendment does not go as far as that of my colleague from New Jersey. 
   Nonetheless, I recognize that there are not yet the votes in the Senate to pass the Lautenberg amendment and I do not wish to overlook the positive crime-fighting proposals that the Hatch amendment makes. These include establishment of the CUFF (``Criminal Use of Firearms by Felons'') program, which will provide $50 million for tougher enforcement of existing gun laws, and expansion of the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative, to facilitate the identification and prosecution of gun traffickers. The Hatch amendment also sets tough penalties for gun offenses involving juveniles and seeks to facilitate background checks for gun purchases. These are important, worthy provisions, and they are the reason for my voting in favor of the Hatch amendment.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have not asked for any action on this amendment, but I did want to have it read for the information of the Senate, and I want to speak on it briefly, after which I shall return to my office. 
   Mr. President, over the past few days, many of my colleagues have come to this Chamber and, with heartfelt passion, offered proposals aimed at addressing the scourge of juvenile crime and violence. We have seen efforts to reduce the pervasiveness of violence and indecency on television and in the movies. We have seen efforts to provide the tools parents need in order to make the Internet a safe and educational environment for their children. We have observed proposals to increase criminal penalties for those who would seek to subvert our youth by introducing them to gangs or the drug culture; and we have had attempts to limit children's access to guns. 
   Each of these has been, I believe, an honest effort toward seeking a much-needed solution to this national problem. And yet, despite these proposals, I am deeply concerned that we have overlooked an important element of this crisis--the problem of teen alcohol use--the problem of teen, t-e-e-n, alcohol use--more appropriately, perhaps, alcohol abuse. 
   I have long been concerned about underage drinking. 
   As a matter of fact, I am not an advocate of drinking at any age, but I recognize that not everybody seeks to pattern their own viewpoints and lives after my viewpoints. But especially--especially--I speak with reference to underage drinking. 
   It takes an immense toll on our children and our society. The younger a child starts drinking, the more likely that child is to run into bad, bad trouble down the road. Research has shown, for example, that children who begin drinking before age 15 are four times more likely to develop alcohol dependence than those who abstain from such activity until the legal drinking age of 21. We also know that too many kids are drinking. 
   If one kid is drinking, that is too many. I am not saying that with reference to this legislation. Obviously, if one is drinking, that is one too many. But for the purposes of this statement, let it stand as I say. We also know that too many kids are drinking. 
   During the last month, approximately 34 percent of high school seniors, 22 percent of tenth graders, and 8 percent of eighth graders, have been drunk. 
   That is hard to imagine. I started school in a two-room schoolhouse. I have said that many times, but I like to repeat it because there are still some of us here who remember those times. When I was later in high school, that would not have been tolerated. The parents would not have tolerated it. The community would not have tolerated it. The school principal, the teachers would not have tolerated it. 
   Let me read that again. 
   During the last month, approximately 34 percent of high school seniors--now that is a third of high school seniors--22 percent of the tenth graders; in other words, one-fifth of the tenth graders, and 8 percent of the eighth graders--think of that, 8 percent of the eighth graders--have been drunk! 
   What is going on here? Drunk. How can that happen if there is a parent who observes the responsibilities of a parent? How can a drunk child avoid the observation of the parent? 
   Yes, I said drunk! And, in the most tragic of statistics, we know that, in 1996, 5,233 young people ages 15 to 20 died in alcohol-related traffic accidents--5,233 lives cut short for what? Mr. President, 5,233 young people ages 15 to 20 died, and that means for a long, long time--died in alcohol-related traffic accidents. These statistics should be a cause for great concern not just among Senators, but for everyone throughout this Nation. 
   Everybody. The churches ought to be up in arms about it. Legislators ought to be up in arms about it. The administration ought to put forth a crusade, not just a word here and there, tippy-toeing around. There ought to be a real crusade like the crusade that has been effectively carried on against smoking. Why not have a national crusade against drinking and especially concerning young people in school? Something is wrong. 
   Mr. President, we should also be concerned that, with direct-to-consumer sale of alcohol, children can now get beer, wine, or liquor sent directly to their homes by ordering from catalogues or over the Internet. 
   What a shame. Again, I have to point my finger at the parents. What a shame. Children can now get beer, wine or liquor sent directly to their homes by ordering from catalogs or over the Internet. 
   Unfortunately, these direct-to-consumer sales work to undermine the extremely important controls currently in place in many of our States. 
   Consequently, I am offering this amendment, on behalf of myself and Senator KOHL, in an effort to give States the opportunity to close that loophole and go after those who sell alcohol illegally to children. The Webb-Kenyon Act, a Federal statute dating back to the early part of this century, makes clear that States have the authority to control the shipment of alcohol into the State. Unfortunately, recent court decisions have maintained that the statute provides no enforcement mechanism. In the 1997 case of Florida Department of Business Regulation v. Zachy's Wine and Liquor, for example, the State of Florida was prohibited from enjoining four out-of-State direct shippers on the grounds that neither the 21st amendment to the Constitution, nor the Webb-Kenyon Act, gave the State a Federal right of action for failure to comply with State liquor laws. Thus, as a result of this and other court decisions, the ability of States to vigorously enforce their prerogatives under the 21st amendment and the Webb-Kenyon Act against out-of-State defendants is extremely limited at the very time when illegal alcohol shipments are burgeoning. 
   This amendment would remedy this problem by stating unequivocally--no ands, ifs, or buts; unequivocally--that States have the right to seek an injunction in Federal court to prevent the illegal, interstate sale of alcohol in violation of State law. 
   I am not saying you cannot sell it. I am simply saying that we should obey State laws by not selling alcohol to children--or expect to pay the consequences. 
   This amendment is based on legislation originally introduced earlier this year by the distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. HATCH. The distinguished Senator from Utah has been at the forefront of this issue, and I thank him for his leadership on this important matter. In addition, Senator KOHL is a  cosponsor of my amendment and I sincerely thank him as well for his steadfast support. 
   Beyond my colleagues here in the Senate, though, this legislation has garnered diverse support. Organizations favoring this amendment include the American Academy of Pediatrics, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America, the National Beer Wholesalers Association, the National Licensed Beverage Association and the National Alcohol Beverage Control Association. 
   Mr. President, let me be clear about what my amendment does. It simply clarifies that States may use the Federal courts to obtain an injunction to prevent the illegal shipment of alcohol. It does not overturn or interfere with any existing State law or regulation. It would have no impact on those companies that are selling alcohol products in accordance with State laws. It would not impede legal access to the marketplace. In fact, there are distributors who have offered to sell the products of any wine manufacturer, no matter how small that company might be. My amendment would have no impact on those who are using the Internet to sell alcohol products legally. 
   In sum, companies would remain free to utilize any marketing or sales process currently permitted under State law. That is why companies that legally sell alcohol over the Internet, such as Geerlings and Wade, have endorsed this legislation. The legislation would only impede those who use the Internet or other marketing techniques to avoid compliance with State alcohol laws. 
   Mr. President, as the Senate addresses the pernicious problem of youth crime and violence, I urge my colleagues to join me in addressing this important facet. We should not--indeed, we cannot--turn a blind eye to those who would, and do, violate State laws governing the sale of alcoholic beverages. The laws regulating alcoholic beverages are in place because such products can be--can be--a dangerous product. It should not be shipped to minors. It should not be shipped into States in violation of those States' laws. Congress should act now and ensure that the laws regulating the interstate shipment of alcohol are not rendered meaningless. 
    Mr. President, that completes my statement. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, May 2-8 is National Tourism Week, and I would like to take a few minutes to encourage anyone planning their summer vacation--and this is the time; this is the time to plan the summer vacation. Let me tell you where the place is. This is the place: West Virginia. Anybody who is planning the summer vacation--or looking farther ahead to next year's winter vacation--should consider my favorite destination: West Virginia. 
   I have been in Rome. I have traveled to Agra. I have seen the Taj Mahal. I have walked in the shadows of the pyramids. I have seen the Pantheon and the Parthenon. I have met with great leaders all over the world, face to face, such as the late President Sadat and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek. I joined with the Generalissimo and the madam on their birthday up at Sun Moon Lake many years ago. But let me tell you, after having been to these four points of the compass, my favorite destination is still West Virginia. And I have visited Texas, may I say to my friend, the senior Senator from the Lone Star State. I made 26 speeches in the Bible Belt of Texas in 1960. I traveled over the northeastern part of Texas making speeches--26 in 3 days. I even took my fiddle with me and played a few tunes. Anyhow, there is just nothing like West Virginia. That is my favorite destination. 
   Within an easy drive of much of the Nation, West Virginia offers one delight after another, whether for families, adventurers, romantic couples, or groups.  
   If you are interested in history, may I say to my Senate 
   colleagues, West Virginia has plenty, from delicate millennia-old fern and trilobite fossils embedded in her coal seams and rock outcroppings to the monumental burial mounds of the mysterious Adena people that date back to 1000 B.C. And I can tell you about history that goes much farther back than that. 
   Frontier forts that mark West Virginia's time at the leading edge of American expansion are scattered across the State, and are populated with costumed, re-enactors who can weave fascinating true stories of the sometimes harrowing escapades experienced by our Nation's early settlers. Point Pleasant, WV, marks the site of the first land battle of the Revolutionary War. Numerous Civil War battlefields abound from West Virginia's tumultuous birth as a State, none more famous than Harper's Ferry, where in 1859 abolitionist John Brown led a raid on the U.S. arsenal, sparking a chain of events leading to that epic struggle. 
   Industries that sparked a different kind of revolution still operate in West Virginia, from the steel mill in Weirton, WV, where we have the largest ESOP in the world--that is, Employee-Stock Option Plan--to the coal mines in southern West Virginia. In Beckley, you can visit a coal mine and see firsthand the danger and effort involved in extracting the compressed energy that still provides almost half of the Nation's electricity. And those who love classic locomotives would feel at home there, as several steam excursions offer the opportunity to chug behind a puffing engine as it clickety-clacks through scenes of pastoral harmony. 
   West Virginia's history sings through the music festivals scheduled across the state throughout the year, ranging from classical to country, bluegrass to jazz. History also comes to life in the fine crafts produced in small village potteries and quilting bees as well as by storied West Virginia glass makers whose wares have been presented to presidents and foreign heads of state. And history continues to be made by her artisans, musicians, and writers, many of whom are accessible at craft and music festivals, or through factory tours. 
   West Virginia is not just for lovers of history, however. It is also for lovers of fun. The state boasts a great array of state parks with lodges and cabins perfect for family entertainment. All these one can see in West Virginia. At these public parks, as well as at many privately-owned facilities, activities can be found to suit everyone in the family, from golf courses designed by the greats in the game to horseback riding along mountain trails, from fishing in coursing streams or placid lakes to hiking to breathtaking vistas, and, of course, skiing at five major ski resorts. 
   Every season in West Virginia offers its own attractions. In the springtime, coursing white water thunders through rocky causeways bedecked in snowy rhododendron and dogwood, vibrant redbud and delicate trillium. In summer, cool springs bubble in shadow-filled woods where wild ginseng grows, while in meadows, Queen Anne's Lace, purple coneflowers, golden Rudbeckia, and blue chicory weave a madras plaid of wildflowers as ruby throated hummingbirds flit among the honeysuckle. In the fall, West Virginia's sugar maples, tulip poplars, sweetgums, and hickories flame in colors rivaling any in New England, and herds of whitetail deer and flocks of elusive wild turkeys fatten on the beechnuts, walnuts, and acorns. Winter's snows fall thick and white, creating an austerely beautiful palette of linear grey, black, and blue shadows on the hillsides that make the color and light of numerous Christmas festivals a welcome contrast. 
   If enjoying the scenery is not enough for the daredevil in you, then see if you can tame Seneca Rocks with a pair of climbing shoes, a bag of chalk, and a length of rope. Venture into the depths of Organ Cave in Ronceverte, where Thomas Jefferson, when he visited, did little more than sample the over forty miles of passages that have been mapped to date. Or challenge the mighty Gauley River, or the wild and scenic New River, in a raft or kayak, to learn just how powerful and devious a few thousand cubic feet of water can be when they are moving at great speed over car-sized boulders. Set your mountain bike upon trails that will strain your thighs as well as your bike brakes. Then, to relax, float lazily down the South Branch of the Potomac River in West Virginia, where it still looks as it must have to the early settlers, with mist rolling off the crystal waters as they wend their way between canyon-like walls, with bald eagles soaring overhead. 
   When the day is done, you can count on good food and a soft pillow anywhere in West Virginia. Bed and Breakfast establishments cater to every fancy, from homespun log cabins bedecked in quilts to antique-filled `stately ladies' whose names reflect their historic pasts. Romance is easy to find before a crackling fire laid on a stone grate or on a porch swing overlooking the last violet rays of sunset. Hidden in the hills, too, are grand resorts and spas offering every amenity for the weary traveler. Some colonial-era spas are still active, while others have been more recently developed, but all offer blissful relaxation. Some also offer award-winning water. Berkeley Springs was founded by George Washington and others and originally called Bath after the spa town in England. The world famous Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs lists royalty as well as Presidents, Senators, and Governors in its guest book. 
   The comforts of your home away from home may make it difficult to get out of bed, but the allure of shopping is strong in those hills. Outlet malls with true bargains compete with artist studios, artisan workshops, and factory stores to fill your car trunk, but with only a little planning, your Christmas and birthday giving may be highlighted by unique and thoughtful treasures. 
   Of course, the greatest treasure in West Virginia is her people. Friendly, smiling, and helpful, they can even make getting lost a pleasurable adventure. So do come, do come and share in the beauty, in the history, in the romance, in the adventure that is West Virginia. Come a tourist and leave a friend. 
   I hope I have sparked a little curiosity in the state that I am so proud to represent. As long winded as politicians are reputed to be, and it may be the case in my instance, I could filibuster for days on the things to see and do in West Virginia without beginning to name everything. For more information, come by and visit my office. 
   My staff will give you a telephone number for the State's official travel guide so you can visit West Virginia, and you can also find a lot of these things on the World Wide Web. 
   I yield the floor and I thank Senators for listening.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, over the weekend, a glimmer of light broke through the war clouds shrouding Yugoslavia. That light was kindled by the release of the three American soldiers who have been held hostage in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia since their capture by the forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on March 31. The individual responsible for this remarkable turn of events is the Reverend Jesse L. Jackson. For his efforts, he has earned the thanks of a grateful nation. Due to the faith and determination of Mr. Jackson, the Reverend Joan Brown Campbell of the National Council of Churches and the delegation of religious leaders that Mr. Jackson led to Yugoslavia, in this one small corner of a terrible conflict, good has triumphed over evil. 
   I have no doubt but that the motives of President Milosevic in freeing the American servicemen will be analyzed, dissected, and ruminated on by the commentators in the coming days. Despite all the conjectures, we may never know what he was hoping to achieve. Surely Milosevic will be disappointed if he believes that this gesture, welcome as it is, will blind the United States and the rest of NATO to the atrocities that he is inflicting on the ethnic Albanian population of Kosovo. 
   But in contrast to Mr. Milosevic, we do know what the Reverend Mr. Jackson was hoping to achieve. 
   He has faced some of the most ruthless strongmen in the world, including Syrian President Hafiz Assad, Cuban President Fidel Castro, and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
   In 1984, Mr. Jackson won the release from Syria of Navy Lieutenant Robert Goodman Jr., who was shot down over Lebanon. That same year, he persuaded Castro to release 48 American and Cuban prisoners. In 1990, he helped to win freedom for more than 700 foreigners who were being detained as human shields by Saddam Hussein following the invasion of Kuwait. His trip to Yugoslavia marks the fourth time that Jesse Jackson has won freedom for hostages. 
   In the faces of the freed soldiers and their families, I am reminded once again that faith can move mountains. I salute the Reverend Mr. Jackson and his delegation for their remarkable success.  
   Mr. President, as a mark of respect for Mr. Jackson and the delegation of church leaders, I am today submitting a Sense of the Senate Resolution commending Mr. Jackson for the deep faith that marked his mission to Belgrade, and for his successful efforts to free Staff Sergeant Andrew A. Ramirez of California, Staff Sergeant Christopher J. Stone of Michigan, and Specialist Steven M. Gonzales of Texas. We welcome these soldiers home with open arms. We also salute the brave men and women of our armed forces who remain in harm's way in the Balkans. Their courage and patriotism, and the dedication and sacrifice of their families, are appreciated and honored by all Americans. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may send the resolution to the desk and that it be held there until the majority leader and the minority leader decide upon a proper disposition of it, but that it can't be held longer than a day, the end of business today.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona. I thank him for his courtesy. I thank him for his leadership on this resolution and for his leadership on many of the great issues that we have debated in this Senate from time to time. There are occasions when I vote with Mr. MCCAIN. There are occasions when I feel that we do not see eye to eye. That is not to say that I do not have the greatest respect for his position, for his viewpoint. I do have. 
   Mr. President, I commend Senator MCCAIN, and I commend the other Senators, Senator BIDEN and the others, who have cosponsored this resolution, for having the courage of their convictions and for standing up for that in which they believe. I am sorry that I cannot agree on this occasion, but there may be a time down the road when we will be working together and I can agree and they can agree with me. 
   I shall not use more than 5 minutes, Mr. President. 
   The course of action that they are advocating--giving the President blanket authority to use whatever force he deems necessary to resolve the Kosovo conflict--is a bold and possibly risky stroke. But whatever the outcome, they are forcing the Senate to confront the Kosovo crisis head-on, and that in itself is noteworthy. 
   Unfortunately, this resolution troubles me for a number of reasons. First, in my judgment, it is premature. In response to a request from the President, the Senate authorized air strikes against Yugoslavia in March. To date, the President has not requested any expansion of that authority. In fact, he has specifically stated on numerous occasions that the use of ground troops is not being contemplated. 
   I think that has been a mistake from the very beginning, virtually saying to the Yugoslavian leader that we have no intention whatsoever of confronting you with ground troops. That loosens whatever bonds or chains Mr. Milosevic may otherwise feel constrain him. But the President has not announced that. 
   Now it is deep into our spring, and by the time we put ground troops on the ground, I assume it will be nearing winter in the Balkans. I think that the President has made a mistake from the very beginning in saying we have no intent. I would prefer to let Mr. Milosevic guess as to our intent than tell him we have no intent of doing thus and so. 
   If the intent of this resolution is to send a message to Slobodan Milosevic that the United States is serious about its commitment to the NATO operation in Kosovo, there are better ways to accomplish that objective. Swift action on the emergency supplemental appropriations bill to pay for the Kosovo operation would be a good first step. 
   Second, this resolution has the practical effect of releasing the President from any obligation to consult with Congress over future action in Kosovo. With this language, the Senate is effectively bowing out of the Kosovo debate and ceding all authority to the executive branch. 
   My friends may say that the Senate is not entertaining any debate anyhow, but at least it might do so. I do not think this is in the best interest of the Nation. The President needs to consult Congress, but nobody can seem to agree on just exactly what ``consultation'' means. 
   The President has had a few of us down to the White House upon several occasions. I have gone upon three occasions, and I have declined to go upon one, I believe, but those consultations, while they are probably beneficial and should be had, are really not enough. But the President does need to consult with Congress, and if he determines ground troops are needed in Kosovo, he needs to make that case to the American people. 
   He has to make the case. Nobody can make that case for him. The Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, cannot make the case. The Vice President cannot make the case. Who is going to listen to Sandy Berger? I am not going to listen very much. So who can make the case? Nobody but the President can really make the case. We in the Senate will do the President no favor by giving him the means to short circuit the process. 
   Third, this resolution goes beyond policy and infringes on the power of  Congress to control the purse. If the Senate gives the President blanket authorization to ``use all necessary force and other means'' to accomplish the goals and objectives set by NATO for the Kosovo operation, the Senate has no choice but to back that up with a blank check to pay for it. 
   I think I have to agree with the distinguished Senator from Arizona in most of what he said. Practically speaking, he is exactly right. He is precisely correct when he says that the only real check that the Congress has upon the President is the power over the purse. Money talks. That is the raw power. Congress alone has that power. 
   If we were to adopt this resolution, we would be essentially committing the United States to pay an undetermined amount of money for an unknown period of time to finance an uncertain and open-ended military offensive. Mr. President, that, by any standard, is not sound policy. 
   I believe there are better ways for the Senate to address the conflict in Kosovo, ways in which we can encourage the administration to work with Congress and to listen to the views of the American people as expressed through their representatives in Congress. I have repeatedly urged the President to provide Congress--and the American people--with more details on the Kosovo strategy, including the projected level of U.S. involvement in terms of personnel and equipment, the estimated cost and source of funding, the expected duration and exit strategy, and the anticipated impact on military readiness and morale. 
   Of course, we heard the promises made in connection with Bosnia: We were only going to be there a year. Repeatedly, we put that question to the administration people and they assured us, ``It will only take about a year.'' 
   We have heard those promises before. We do not pay much attention to them anymore. Those assurances do not mean anything. 
   The President has certainly made a good faith effort to date to consult on this matter, with Members of Congress, but we are only in the opening stages of this operation, and the path ahead is very unclear. The President would be well served to continue consulting closely with Congress and to seek Congressional support for any decision that he contemplates involving ground forces. For its part, the Senate should not take any action that would jeopardize this dialog, as I believe this resolution would do. 
   Mr. President, again I commend Senator MCCAIN and Senator BIDEN, and the other Senators who are cosponsors, for seeking a straightforward determination of the role that Congress will play in the Kosovo conflict. 
   There is no question where the Senator from Arizona stands. He steps up to the plate, takes hold of the bat, says, here is how I stand, this is what I believe in. He is willing to have the Senate vote. I admire him for that. I admire his patriotism. I admire his determination to have the Senate speak. But I do not believe that this resolution is the appropriate action to take at this time. I urge my colleagues to table it. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as we consider this resolution before the Senate to remember those who lost their lives just one short week ago in Littleton, Colorado, we are once again reminded of an event which is heart-wrenchingly tragic and one that bears out the need for educators, parents, and government officials to work together to ensure that the classroom is a safe place for all students. 
   The tragic events last Tuesday at Columbine High School serve as yet another warning that something has gone terribly wrong in our nation. Schools are not the idyllic places that they once were. They are less and less safe havens, conducive to study, but, rather, increasingly, are proving to be unstable communities, teetering on the brink of violent outbursts. 
   It makes me long for the old high school which I attended and from which I graduated 65 years ago. It makes me long for the little two-room schoolhouse in which I began my studies along about 1923. Sometimes I think schools are too large these days. They don't allow for the personal attention that teachers could otherwise show students. They are conducive, I think, by their very largeness to the creation of gangs, hate groups, and so on. 
   The scene of screaming students rushing outside through schoolhouse doors, some hobbling or clenching a gunshot wound to the arm or leg, and others overwhelmed with fear for their own lives, has become all too familiar to this nation during the past few years. From West Paducah, Kentucky, to Jonesboro, Arkansas; Springfield, Oregon; and now to the community of Littleton, Colorado, gun shots have shattered the silence and tranquillity of an otherwise typical high school day, abruptly ending the innocence of youth, and launching families and friends into some of the most difficult days of life that no human being should have to confront. 
   We would have never dreamed of this kind of thing in my school days. 
   Mr. President, there is a crying need to do more to protect our children. But, the unfortunate reality of the situation is that there is no single-step panacea to prevent further bloodshed at schools across the country. One could make many suggestions. Many suggestions are readily obvious. But the problem of school violence does not begin and end on school grounds. It is much more pervasive. It reaches beyond the schoolyard gates, into our communities and into our homes. 
   It is unfortunate that we live in a country where criminals find ways to get around the law and do evil, but it happens. Hatred is a powerful demon that can draw people to do things we do not truly understand. I have seen it in my own lifetime, and, I try, whenever possible, to help teach young people to avoid such egregious mistakes. Of course, the young are not alone in the making of these mistakes. But mine is only one voice. But it is one voice. 
   I often take time out to talk with the pages here. I don't have to do it. Nobody makes me do it. Nobody tells me to do it. But I like to talk to these young people. These are fine young people, these pages of ours on both sides of the aisle. I often pause to take a half hour with them to talk about wholesome experiences, and to relate good stories from Chaucer, and from other great authors, as I feel that if I can do a little good with these young people here, who knows where this influence will stop? 
   While it is my intention to make any and all efforts to prevent this kind of tragedy before it visits another region of the country, it is essential that we take up the effort and the responsibility to raise our children, to nurture them, to protect them, to guard them as much as we can from these evil influences that are always ready to prey upon them, and it is my desire always to try to provide these young people with a solid foundation, 
   to encourage them to engage in wholesome pursuits and to read from good literature, and in this way I think adults can help to  provide them with a solid foundation--spiritually, emotionally, and intellectually. We have to indulge with caution any idea that there can be morality without religion. Protecting our Nation's children should be a team effort, not simply a matter of public policy. 
   If we ever have a hope of preventing violence in the classroom, parents must take an active role in their child's life and monitor their child's behavior for unusual actions or alarming conduct. Teachers carry similar responsibilities and must no longer ``chalk up'' unusual behavior to the simple conclusion of a student having a bad day. We have witnessed too many oversights like this which have snatched the lives of other innocent children caught in the line of fire. 
   Moreover, we should not be surprised, given the excessive and mindless violence--I 
   tell you, it is excessive, because I see it when I turn on the television--mindless violence, excessive violence. We should not be surprised then, given the excessive and mindless violence infiltrating, permeating, the television airwaves and now the Internet, that we really have a problem in today's society. 
   It is not a hidden fact that I am no fan of the muck that spews out over the tube or the obscenities rumbled by so-called actors and actresses in a TV drama, but there is little that we in Congress can do to regulate children from jumbling their brains with this nonsense. 
   Parents must no longer give their children free rein of the remote control or unmonitored access to dial up those polluted websites running rampant over the Internet. Children, with their inquisitive young minds, too often repeat what they see on TV or read about over the Internet, and with little guidance from parents, it is next to impossible to prevent this often fatal ``copycat'' action from recurring. 
   Probably most disappointing to me is that in watching the news recently, it seems that the tragic news of a school shooting has become somewhat of a feeding frenzy for the media to hit the airwaves with explicit details, often those that are too easily digested by a listening youngster experiencing emotional distress. It seems counterproductive, even dangerous, to offer what amounts to free advertising by reporting on the Internet websites that hand out free explanations on how to make a bomb or where to obtain a gun. Mr. President, when is enough enough? 
   Efforts to end school violence can be, and will likely be, undone by this practice of revealing too much information with little thought of the future implications. I urge the media to think about the possible consequences of their actions before trying to beat the other news team to the latest punch line. Supplying children with information that could lead to the perpetuation of school violence is not the solution. Children need not be confronted with all of the finite details of the gory pictures as they sit down to the breakfast table with their parents. 
   The tragedy at Columbine High School may be impossible to ever, ever truly understand. But that should not deter us from seeking answers and working for solutions. It is time to stop wringing our hands over this issue and take action so that we in Congress can support measures that might prevent a recurrence of this nightmare. 
   I am concerned that we may be approaching the day when our nation's students spend more time in the classroom thinking about the potential for a gun pop than a pop quiz. A day when teachers are too preoccupied with their own fear of a gun emerging into their classroom to teach their students the basic grammatical structure or algebraic formula properly. Today's children deserve the opportunity to get an education. Today's teachers deserve the opportunity to teach. They deserve this just as much as the children and the teachers of yesteryear. We must all do whatever we can to ensure that today's children and those of the future have an opportunity to excel academically in an environment free from guns, knives, and other weapons. 
   I look forward to working with Senator LIEBERMAN in the upcoming weeks to author legislation that would establish a National Commission on School Violence to help get at the root of this problem if that is possible. It is my hope that by joining forces between educators, children, parents, media, and others, we will gain a more vivid perspective on what leads to violent behavior behind the schoolhouse doors, and that we can begin to remedy this harrowing problem overtaking our nation's schools. I urge teachers and parents, church and civic leaders to do the same. This type of disaster can occur anywhere--we must act now if we are to prevent a replay of this nightmare in another American community. 
   I hope parents throughout the Nation are thinking soberly, soberly about this problem. 
 I took a piece of plastic clay And idly fashioned it one day 
 And as my fingers pressed it still It moved and yielded to my will. 
 I came again when days were past. The bit of clay was hard at last. 
 The form I gave it, it still bore, And I could change that form no more. 
 I took a piece of living clay And gently formed it day by day. 
 And molded with my power and art. A young child's soft and yielding heart. 
 I came again when years were gone, He was a man I looked upon. 
 He still that early impress wore, And I could change him nevermore.  
   There is a lesson in this for all of us. I hope we will learn it. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I join with my distinguished colleagues, Senators MURKOWSKI, HAGEL, CRAIG, HUTCHINSON, GRAMS, and ROBERTS, in cosponsoring the Energy and Climate Policy Act of 1999 which was introduced earlier today. The legislation provided in this bill is one of a number of options that the U.S. could undertake to improve energy efficiency and security and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While the complex issue of climate change will not be solved by a single bill or action, this legislaiton provides additional funding for research and development for important programs that I have long supported, like clean coal technologies, an American-developed initiative. The bill would also take steps to coordinate and implement energy efficiency research as well as begin the process of better reporting greehouse gas reductions at the Department of Energy. 
   If substantial steps are going to be taken globally to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we must accelerate the development and commercialization of new technologies, anticipate changing conditions, and encourage public/private partnerships. Both developing and industrialized nations must find ways to tackle this complex and multi-faceted problem. There is no single answer--there is no one silver bullet to fix this issue. 
   Any viable climate change policy must include efforts to develop cleaner and more efficient fossil fuel-based energy production in order to meet growing energy needs. Clean coal technologies must be a part of that solution. When one examines the increase in global greenhouse gas emissions over the next several decades, the utilization of clean coal technologies is essential. Nations that are serious about reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the long term, especially many of the largest developing nations like China, cannot ignore clean coal technologies. 
   In 1984, I proposed, and the Congress adopted, a $750 million Clean Coal Technology program. Originally, the program was designed to achieve long-term, real reductions in acid rain. Since then, the program has expanded, thanks to a joint government-industry investment of more than $6 billion. This investment has led to 40 first-of-a-kind projects in 18 states, including an array of high-technology ideas that can spearhead a new era of clean, efficient power plants which will continue to burn our nation's abundant coal resources. Much useful technology has resulted from this synergy of effort between government and private investment by incorporating leading-edge federal laboratories and practical business applications. More needs to be done, and the Energy and Climate Policy Act of 1999 seeks to fuel this synergy by encouraging more public-private projects 
   in all areas of energy production and use. This boost will help to move ideas into reality. 
   It is critical that the U.S. find better ways to use our own energy resources by encouraging more research and development. These initiatives have both environmental and economic benefits. This bill provides an additional $200 million per year for ten years for research, development, and demonstration programs through competitive grants. It would also take further steps to coordinate and implement energy research and development. These programs build upon the many voluntary efforts that government at all levels and industry have already undertaken to improve energy use as well as to reduce, avoid, or sequester greenhouse gas emissions. All sectors of the economy should be able to benefit from these programs. 
   In addition to its many benefits at home, the clean coal technology program can also provide an economically beneficial and environmentally sound solution in the international market. According to the coal industry, coal production will continue to increase  worldwide. Coal can be a cost-competitive source of fuel for electricity generation, but, like other fossil fuels, it will require improvements in its environmental credentials. Developing nations are currently searching for cost-effective ways to upgrade their older, higher-polluting power plants and to expand their power production capacity. These nations can learn from our experiences and utilize our new technologies to combat these problems. I note that during the recent visit of Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, the U.S. and China both agreed that more should be done to employ clean coal technologies. 
   After 2015, China is expected to surpass the U.S. as the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Global warming is a global problem. It is not just an American problem. It is not just a European problem. And as such, it requires a global solution. Industrialized nations' efforts to reduce our own greenhouse gas emissions will be for naught unless reductions are also made by nations like China and India. Coal will continue to be a major source of their energy production; therefore, clean coal technologies are essential to their responsible growth. The U.S. must support further efforts to encourage clean coal and other energy efficient technologies and to take them from the drawing board to the marketplace. Funding for these programs is pointless unless our government works in conjunction with the private sector to break down market barriers and prove the viability of such programs in the global market. 
   Research, development, and demonstration programs provide numerous benefits to improve air quality standards, increase our energy efficiency, and reduce greenhouse gases. While the intent of this bill is independent of the Kyoto Protocol, this legislation, in addition to its many other benefits, could help the U.S. in addressing climate change challenges that might result from the implementation of any future treaty. 
   In its present form, the Kyoto Protocol does not meet the conditions outlined in S. Res. 98, which passed the Senate on July 25, 1997; namely, it must include developing country participation as well as provide sufficient detail to explain the economic impact of such an agreement for the United States. I recognize that the Protocol is a work in progress. The international negotiations to bring it into compliance with S. Res. 98 will require perseverance and patience and are part of a long-term effort to address global climate change. The Administration has not submitted the Kyoto Protocol to the Senate for its advice and consent and has indicated it has no intention of doing so in the foreseeable future. the Administration has indicated that it needs at least two additional years to complete negotiations on the Buenos Aires Action Plan which includes negotiating major aspects of the Protocol such as developing country participation, emissions trading, the Clean Development Mechanism, and forest and soil sinks. The Administration has also pledged not to implement any portion of the Kyoto Protocol prior to its advice and consent in the Senate. I hope that that pledge will continue to be honored. 
   Over the last year and a half, a number of economic studies have been completed, but we have yet to see a comprehensive analysis of the Kyoto Protocol. I remain firmly convinced that it is critical that the United States knows in some detail the probable costs and benefits of the specific actions proposed to address global climate change. 
   In summary, improved resource use, energy efficiency and security, and global climate change will all be critical issues for every nation in the new millennium. Market-based solutions and research and development funding will play a vital role in addressing these issues. By cosponsoring the Energy and Climate Policy Act of 1999, I hope that U.S. firms can receive additional funding to help increase research and development for important new technologies. These initiatives, in addition to other market-based solutions, could provide vehicles for real improvements in energy efficiency as well as reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and an important marketable solution for global participation in such reductions.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this weekend, the 19 member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  will gather in Washington to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the establishment of NATO. Some may see the juxtaposition of this summit against the images of NATO airstrikes over Yugoslavia as being ironic. I see it differently. I see it as prophetic. 
   The world has changed in the past 50 years, but as the events in Kosovo so graphically illustrate, the world has grown no less dangerous. NATO, likewise, has undergone significant changes over the years but remains no less important to the security of Europe. The key challenge facing NATO today is the dramatic change in the nature of the threat. The cold war is history; the Soviet Union is defunct; the Berlin Wall is just a pile of rubble. Forces massed along the borders have given way to flash points dotted around the globe. The tense but symmetrical standoff in Europe between the East and the West has been exchanged for the capriciousness of terrorists and tyrants. 
   Just as the nature of the threat has evolved, so must the structure and mission of NATO metamorphose if it is to remain relevant into the 21st century. 
   In 1949, when the alliance was formed, the Soviet Union and its satellites posed the only credible threat to Western security. It was the chilly dawn of the cold war era, and NATO was precision-tuned to meet the cold war challenge. In the ensuing decades, as NATO expanded from the original 12 to 16 member nations, the alliance grew in strength and stature to guard Western Europe against the formidable forces of the Warsaw Pact nations. 
   Conflict in Korea and Vietnam, turbulence in the Middle East, the growing influence of China--none of the cataclysmic events of the second half of the 20th century deterred NATO from its focus on the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. And, in the end, NATO's intensity and single-mindedness paid off handsomely, with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. 
   Through the years, NATO has adjusted its strategy and its mission to meet changing circumstances, but never has the challenge been as great or as far reaching as it is today. Where once NATO contended with the shifting fortunes of a cold war enemy massed along a single front, today the alliance is confronted with brush fires in its backyard, the threat of terrorism from geographically remote nations and organizations, and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in virtually every direction. 
   To meet this shifting political and military landscape, NATO has expanded on its primary focus of defending its members against the threat of attack by reaching out to its former foes to promote European stability and security. Only last month, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic were welcomed into the alliance. And nine other nations are clamoring for membership. 
   It is in this context that the 19 members of the alliance will gather in Washington to mark the anniversary of NATO and to discuss the future of the alliance. And it is in this context that the conflict in Kosovo can serve as a useful template for many of the challenges that the alliance is likely to face in the early years of the 21st century. 
   The lessons learned in Kosovo, preliminary though they may be at this point, should be brought to the summit table. The lessons that are still to come, as NATO prosecutes the attack on Yugoslavia, must be accommodated in any future strategy. 
   Several specific issues arising from the Kosovo conflict deserve careful consideration by the members of the alliance. And these include the following: 
   First, NATO should discuss the wisdom of establishing a more robust forward operating presence in Europe beyond alliance headquarters. Given their history, the Balkans are a logical choice. The time and logistical constraints built into ferrying people and equipment from the United States, Britain, France and elsewhere to the front are formidable. The result is a potentially serious disconnect in the ability of commanders in the field to respond rapidly and effectively to changing circumstances. One example of the problems this remote staging has caused is the agonizing wait for the U.S. Apache helicopters to arrive in theater--a delay that has cost NATO in terms of tactical flexibility and has given the Serbs in Kosovo a lethal window of opportunity to carry forward their ethnic cleansing activities. 
   Second, and in conjunction with a more aggressive NATO forward operating presence, the allies must accelerate their efforts to field common systems and increase interoperability. This does not mean that the United States should become an open-ended pipeline for the transfer of technology to our NATO allies, but there are basic military tools that should be available to, and designated for, NATO operations. 
   Third, the Kosovo operation should be the genesis for a top-to-bottom review of the NATO decisionmaking process. While the system seems to be working reasonably well considering that it is a conflict being fought by committee, there is no doubt in my mind that decisionmaking must be streamlined. It is, for example, far too cumbersome to give each of the member nations veto power over the list of military targets. It may be well for NATO to consider establishing subgroups of responsibility defined operationally and perhaps even geographically. At all costs, NATO should not blunder into the decisionmaking no-man's-land that has paralyzed the effectiveness of the United Nations. 
   And finally, NATO should continue to engage Russia as a vital partner in its quest for stability and security, and redouble it efforts to bring other former Soviet bloc nations into the alliance once they have met NATO membership criteria. This is the time to reach out, not to pull back. NATO's sphere of interest and influence no longer spans just the Atlantic Ocean; it spans a vast and complex territory never contemplated in 1949. In this new operating arena, a broader but still solid base will mean a stronger, more vigorous alliance. 
   We would be foolhardy to believe that Kosovo is an anomaly, just as we would be foolhardy to believe that Kosovo will be the only model of future conflict. The threats that face the NATO alliance at the beginning of the 21st century are many and varied, and they will doubtless proliferate in the coming years. The threat of nuclear attack from rogue nations, the possibility of so-called ``loose nukes'' falling into the hands of terrorists, the danger of chemical or biological warfare, the prospect of cyber-attack, the reality of increasing ethnic tensions amid shifting resources and contested borders--these are some of the threats that the United States and its NATO allies face in the coming years. And these are just the threats we can predict today. Who knows, ten years or twenty years from now, what perils the world will face and what shape our defenses will have to take. But as the conflict in Kosovo so sharply indicates, we must be prepared for the unexpected, even the unimaginable. If NATO has the staying power to celebrate its centennial fifty years from now, it will be in a world that few of us can image today. 
   NATO has served a worthy purpose since its inception in 1949. Its role in the future security and stability, not only of Europe, but also of the United States as well as far-flung corners of the world, is equally essential. And so I salute NATO on its 50th anniversary, and I urge its representatives to weigh carefully the future goals and mission of the alliance. NATO is at a crossroads: it can remain a force for security and stability in the world, or it can become just another relic of the cold war. For the sake of us all, I hope that NATO charts a course of action that will steer it safely through the turbulence of today and into the 21st century. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I am proud to join my colleagues from Michigan, Senators ABRAHAM and LEVIN, in sponsoring S. 531, legislation authorizing the presentation of a Congressional Gold Medal to Mrs. Rosa Parks. 
   As we approach the 21st century, it is only fitting that the Senate take this moment to recognize the efforts of Rosa Parks, who, on December 1, 1955, proved that one person can make a difference in the world in which we live. By refusing to give up her seat on a city bus, an act which put her in violation of the segregation laws then in place in her community, Mrs. Parks sparked a series of events that have helped to shape this nation's path. 
   For refusing to acquiesce to the systematic degradation placed upon her and other black-Americans, Rosa Parks was arrested. But rather than accept the status quo, this quiet lady from Montgomery, Alabama, chose to challenge the segregation order by seeking redress in our federal courts. During the court battle, Mrs. Parks was harassed, threatened, and even lost her job as a seamstress at a local department store. In the end, though, Rosa Parks won her battle when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled segregation unconstitutional, thus vindicating her simple, but monumental, pursuit of justice and equality. 
   Madam President, the actions of Rosa Parks were not staged for the television cameras. They were not part of a grand scheme to create a test case. On the contrary, they were the actions of a single individual determined to preserve her dignity as best she could. They were the actions of a simple lady who, at that moment in her life, decided that enough was enough. 
   It is fitting, then, that the Senate should award the Congressional Gold Medal to Rosa Parks, the highest award that the Congress can bestow on a private citizen, in recognition of her courage and her lifelong commitment to the Jeffersonian ideal that ``all men are created equal.''

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased to add my name as an original cosponsor of the bill introduced by Senator ROCKEFELLER that would provide the necessary authority to implement the trade drawback allowance based on the commercially interchangeable feature of two rubber vulcanization accelerators. 
   These two chemicals, commonly referred to as CBS and TBBS, are one-and-the-same for all practical purposes. CBS and TBBS belong to the same class and subclass of rubber vulcanization accelerator chemicals; they can be manufactured by similar industrial processes using the same active ingredients and identical process steps; and they generally cannot be distinguished by informed analysts once used in the finished rubber product. In short, CBS and TBBS are commercially interchangeable in function and use--the specified circumstances required under Section 202 of U.S. trade law to receive duty drawback benefits on a substitution basis. 
   By establishing the commercial interchangeability for CBS and TBBS, duty drawback law can be implemented. Under duty drawback law, a company would receive a refund of import duties--called a duty drawback--paid by that company on its imports of CBS, based on the exports of the company's production of TBBS, or vice-versa. In other words, for every ton of TBBS that a company exports out of the United States, the company would receive a refund of duties that it paid on a ton of CBS that was imported into the United States. A drawback allowance on the commercially interchangeable standard is granted on a case-by-case authorization. The bill I join Senator ROCKEFELLER in cosponsoring would simply provide the commercially interchangeable CBS and TBBS chemicals with the necessary authorization required by law. 
   This bill is vital to a West Virginia company, Flexsys, that produces both CBS and TBBS. Flexsys provides 230 jobs in West Virginia with an average annual salary of $42,000. Without the duty drawback, these jobs are at risk due to the increasingly competitive chemical market. The purpose of the drawback statutes is to permit American-made products to compete more effectively in world markets. The Congress adopted drawback provisions recognizing that U.S. manufacturers need the authority to enable them to select the most advantageous production methods. Flexsys meets the conditions set forth under drawback law, and my review of Flexsys has convinced me that it is the type of company that was in mind when this Body approved the drawback statutes. 
   In closing, I urge my colleagues to support our effort to aid hardworking Americans through passage of this bill. Enactment of this bill would fulfill the purpose of drawback law by advancing the continued operations at Flexsys and, as a result, the utilization of American labor and capital.

And if he catches me off the floor once, I will take my lumps. I ought to be here, and not keep everybody else waiting. I have a wife who is 81 years old. I am 81 years old. She is there waiting on me. I am here. I think Senators ought to have a little compassion and respect for one another. If the leader will just teach us one time, for those who are not here when that announcement is made, they are going to show up as absent, that will break Senators from imposing on other Senators by being late for votes.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in the report accompanying the budget resolution now before the Senate (Senate Report 106-27), the first paragraph on page seven contains this statement:  
   A budget resolution is a fiscal blueprint, a guide, a roadmap, that the Congress develops to direct the course of federal tax and spending legislation. It is a set of aggregate spending and revenue numbers covering the twenty broad functional areas of the government, over a long-term fiscal horizon. It is less than substantive law, but is much more than a sense of the Congress resolution.  
   Unfortunately, this budget resolution, this guide, this blueprint, is a roadmap which, if followed for the next ten years, will wreak untold devastation. Having just achieved the first year with a unified budget surplus ($70 billion) in thirty years, last September 30--the end of Fiscal Year 1998--and having been unable to pass a congressional budget resolution for this fiscal year, fiscal year 1999, at all, we now have before the Senate not the usual five-year budget resolution, but a much more ambitious ten-year budget to carry us for the period fiscal years 2000-2009. Over that period, we are told by the Congressional Budget Office that unified budget surpluses will total just over $2.5 trillion. Of that amount, Social Security surpluses make up some $1.8 trillion, or 72 percent. Non-Social Security surpluses, according to CBO, will total $787 billion over that period. For fiscal year 2000, there is, in fact, a non-social security deficit of some $7 billion. That is, there would be no surplus at all in Fiscal Year 2000 except in the Social Security Trust Fund. 
   What does the blueprint now before the Senate, the Republican budget resolution, propose that we do with these multi-trillion-dollar surpluses? Keep in mind that these are only projections; they are not real, and we will not know until after the fact as to whether any of the surpluses projected for any of these 10 years will come to pass. No human being can ever project accurately what Federal revenues or Federal spending will be. No one can know what interest rates will be, or unemployment, or GDP growth. We have had tremendous variances historically with CBO projections, even within one year. To count on their projections for not one, not five, but for 10 years is extremely unwise. 
   But, let us look at the budget resolution now before the Senate. This budget resolution proposes a Federal tax cut which, according to the committee's report, will approximate $142 billion over the next five years, and $778 billion over the next 10 years. The resolution includes a reconciliation instruction to the tax writing committees instructing them to report out these huge tax cuts in a reconciliation bill. Pursuant to that reconciliation instruction, a tax bill of the magnitude contained in the resolution, some $800 billion, will be before the Senate later this year. If enacted and signed by the President, those tax cuts will go into effect regardless of whether any of the projected surpluses take place. 
   This is the height of irresponsibility. Just when we have succeeded in turning the corner on the multi-hundred-billion-dollar annual deficits of the 1980's, here comes the Republican budget resolution saying let us take the as-yet, unachieved future budget surpluses and cut Federal revenues now, whether or not those surpluses ever occur. 
   On that basis alone, if for no other reason, I urge Senators to oppose this budget resolution. 
   But, that is not the only problem we find in this blueprint. There is the question of the levels of discretionary spending that will be made available over the next 10 years if we follow this budget resolution. 
   It is well known that the 1997 Balanced Budget Act placed severe constraints on discretionary spending for the period 1998-2002. Those caps were considered necessary in order to help rid ourselves of the annual Federal budget deficits and achieve surpluses. Nevertheless, it is my view that the discretionary caps for 2000, as well as for the following two years--2001 and 2002--are too tight and will require  massive cuts which should not be undertaken at the same time we are providing the huge tax cuts which I have just described. 
   This resolution calls for funding non-defense discretionary programs in Fiscal Year 2000 at a level of $246 billion, a cut of more than $20 billion, or 7.5 percent, below the present year. To make matters worse, the pending budget resolution would provide increases for a handful of favored programs, such as health, education, and other popular priorities. These plus-ups would mean that other vital, yet unprotected programs, would face cuts of more than 11 percent in 
   Fiscal Year 2000. Cuts of that magnitude, according to the Office of Management and Budget, would affect vital programs such as the following: food safety would be undermined with the lay-off of an estimated 1,000 meat and poultry inspectors; Head Start funding would be cut in excess of $1 billion--cutting services to as many as 100,000 children; the FBI would be cut $337 million, which could result in a reduction of 2,700 FBI agents and support personnel; more than 2,200 air traffic controller positions would be cut; IRS Customer Service would suffer a reduction of 5,000 employees; the number of students in the Work Study Program would decrease by 112,000; and the list goes on and on throughout the entire Federal government. 
   While making these cuts in vital human and physical infrastructure programs across the nation, this budget resolution would increase defense by $18 billion above a freeze in Fiscal Year 2000. Yet, even with this large increase in budget authority, the resolution comes nowhere near covering the outlays that would be necessary to fund the reently-passed pay increase for the military. 
   Mr. President, we are on a collision course, once again, when it comes to passing the thirteen annual appropriation bills. If you liked the omnibus appropriations monstrosity that was necessary to complete action on Fiscal Year 1999 appropriation bills, wait until you see the super-monstrosity that I believe will be necessary for Fiscal Year 2000, if we fail to provide relief from the massive cuts that I have just described. 
   You ain't seen nothin' yet! 
   And, as if Fiscal Year 2000 were not enough, the problems only worsen in the subsequent years. By 2004, OMB projects that this budget resolution would require cuts in non-defense discretionary programs of as much as 27 percent below a freeze. Furthermore, the current statutory discretionary spending caps expire in 2002 but, under this budget resolution, the cuts to non-defense discretionary programs would deepen to 29 percent by 2009, as non-defense discretionary spending would remain substantially below inflation each year through 2009. 
   In conclusion, while I appreciate the difficulties faced by the Budget Committee chairman, Mr. DOMENICI, for whom I have great respect, in crafting this budget resolution, I nevertheless have concluded that it is a roadmap leading us back to the 1980's--a period when we saw trillions of dollars of tax cuts enacted by the Reagan administration, based on faulty projections of budget surpluses which never came to pass, as well as spending cuts which were too extreme and likwise never occurred. Consequently, once those tax cuts were enacted, we entered a period of unprecedented budget deficits with their accompanying tripling of the national debt and the interest on that debt rose to where it is today--a level of almost $1 billion per day. We have turned the corner after many years of hard work and a number of deficit reduction packages. We appear to be headed to a time of budget surpluses which should be used for reducing the debt and providing necessary increases in our national physical and human infrastructure that are so vital to the 21st Century. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this ill-conceived journey along the road back to a repeat of the budgetary disasters of the 1980's. Surely we can do better than this.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, our worst fears have been realized. Months of patient negotiations, bolstered by repeated threats of air strikes, have failed. Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has defied the will and the prayers of the world and has turned his back on the prospect of peace in Kosovo. Indeed, he is intensifying his relentless assault on the ethnic Albanian population of the Serbian province of Kosovo. It was made clear to me and to many of us at the White House this morning that the question is no longer ``whether'' NATO will launch air strikes against Yugoslavia but ``when''. It is entirely possible that by the time these words are uttered, the machinery to launch an air offensive against Yugoslavia will have been put into motion. 
   This is a matter of immense importance and far-reaching consequence for the United States. Senior defense officials have warned that an air operation against Yugoslavia will be extremely dangerous for U.S. and allied forces. This is not Iraq. This is a rugged, mountainous region frequently shrouded in fog and protected by a sophisticated air defense system. If the United States sends aircraft into Yugoslav air space as part of a NATO strike force, we must understand--and accept--the risk of that operation. That risk includes the possibility of downed aircraft, American hostages, and American casualties. 
   An operation of this magnitude and risk should not be undertaken without the express support of Congress and the backing of the American people. We saw in Vietnam what happens when the will of the people is not taken into consideration. 
   Only the President can lead the way in this crisis. Only the President can rally the American people. Only the President can mobilize the troops. Only  the President can unite our NATO allies. Only the President can explain to the American people the reasoning for his intended action and the risks attendant to it. I urged him last week to make his case to the people as well as to the Congress. 
   Mr. President, I again urged the President at the White House this morning to seek the support of the Congress for air strikes against Yugoslavia. I asked him to make that request in writing to the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate. I am pleased that he has done so. I commend him for recognizing the need to seek the support of Congress when the use of force is contemplated. 
   We do not know where this conflict will lead. The winds of war are blowing over Kosovo today. Who knows what fires those winds might fan. Bosnia. Montenegro. Macedonia. Albania. All are in danger of being drawn into a conflagration in the Balkans. With enough sparks, Greece and Turkey could be drawn into the inferno. Although the conflict in Kosovo is far from our doorstep today, it could spread quickly, as wildfires are wont to do. Today our credibility as a world leader is threatened. If the conflict in Kosovo spreads, much more than our credibility will be at stake. If we are to act at all, the time to act is now. 
   All we know for certain is that Slobodan Milosevic is a ruthless and desperate leader. If anything, his defiance of NATO and his repression of the Kosovo Albanians are increasing as his options dwindle. Violence is mounting in Kosovo, and thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees have already fled their homes and villages. The bloodshed has begun. Let us pray to God that it will not turn into a bloodbath. 
   The United States cannot stand idly by and watch the catastrophe unfolding in the Balkans. It is in our national interest to support stability in this volatile region, to prevent the downward spiral into violence and chaos, and to stem the humanitarian disaster spreading out of Kosovo like a contagion. Having raised the stakes so high, a failure to act decisively could have untold consequences. 
   The President may have the primary responsibility in the formulation and execution of foreign policy, but the Congress has an equally weighty responsibility, which is to authorize or refuse to authorize military action. 
   The resolution that we are currently considering, which was drafted by a bipartisan group of Senators, endorses air strikes, and only air strikes, against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The goal of this resolution is twofold: to stop the violence in Kosovo before it escalates into all-out carnage, and to convince President Milosevic in the only terms he understands--brute force--to abandon his campaign of terror against the Kosovars. 
   Mr. President, my thoughts and prayers today are with the brave men and women of the United States military who are willing to put their lives on the line in order to save the lives of countless strangers in a strange land. And my thoughts and prayers are with their families, the parents, spouses, and children who will wait at home, fearing the outcome of every air strike, until this madman Milosevic can be brought to his senses. These are the people to whom we have a duty to show courage in the execution of our responsibility. My prayers are also with the President. His is a heavy burden of responsibility. The decisions he makes in the coming days will affect the lives of many Americans. He is embarked on a somber, sober, and serious undertaking, and I pray that he will find the strength and guidance to bear the burdens of office that will weigh heavily on his shoulders as he faces this crisis.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I read a remarkable article this week in the Hill newspaper concerning the distinguished Senator from Georgia, Mr. CLELAND. The article recounted events that occurred 31 years ago in Vietnam when then-Captain CLELAND was gravely injured in a grenade explosion. The injuries that he received in that horrible accident cost him his right arm and both of his legs, and very nearly cost him his life. He was 25 years old at the time, and just 1 month shy--just 1 month shy--of completing his tour of duty in Vietnam. Now, think of that. Just a month to go. 
   For more than three decades, MAX CLELAND lived with the crushing belief that his own carelessness had caused the accident, that the hand grenade that shattered his body and shattered his life had somehow fallen from his own web belt when he jumped from the helicopter. Most people in MAX CLELAND's situation would have been consumed with self-pity, even if they had had the grit to live. Think of that. The young Captain CLELAND certainly battled it. But as he has handled so many of the challenges that have marked his life since that terrible day in Vietnam, MAX CLELAND triumphed over the lure of self-pity. He triumphed over his injuries. He triumphed over self-doubt. He triumphed over bitterness. 
   Max CLELAND could have given up after that accident in Vietnam. Most of us would have. But he did not. He turned his misfortune into the service of others. Three years after returning home from Vietnam, he was elected to the Georgia State Senate, becoming the youngest member and the only Vietnam veteran in that body. In 1977, he became the youngest administrator of the U.S. Veterans' Administration and the first Vietnam veteran to head that Agency. He returned to Georgia where, in 1982, he was elected Secretary of State. And, in 1996, he was elected to the U.S. Senate from Georgia. 
   Now, that is a remarkable record, a remarkable feat. It is remarkable for anyone to reach the Senate of the United States. Out of all the millions of people that are in America, there are 100 Senators--the same number that were in the original Roman Senate when Romulus founded that city on the banks of the Tiber. He created the Senate, made up of 100 of the wisest men, and he chose old men for that Senate. 
   So here is a man with the disadvantages that MAX CLELAND had to overcome, the struggle that he had to undergo daily and nightly, every hour of the day, even to live, and he made it to the U.S. Senate. In all of that time, he quietly blamed himself for the accident that so radically altered his life. 
   But last week, according to the report in the Hill, Senator CLELAND was stunned to learn from an eyewitness that the grenade that injured him was not one of his own, but had been lost by another soldier. 
   My wife and I are reading the Psalms. Every Sunday, we read it. Actually, we have completed the Psalms, and now we are in Ecclesiastes.  
   Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.  
   In our reading of the Bible, we have already read the New Testament and we have read the Old Testament. We have come all the way down, as I say, to the Book of Ecclesiastes. From the 85th Psalm, I will quote two lines:  
   Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.  
   Through his indomitable spirit, MAX CLELAND overcame the injuries he received as a young Army captain in Vietnam and conquered the temptation to succumb to self-pity. He is an inspiration to us all, and I hope that he finds a measure of peace and solace in the long-lost truth that was revealed to him this past week. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article from the March 17 issue of the Hill, titled, ``For Senator Cleland, a Searing Revelation After 31 Years,'' be printed in its entirety at this point in the RECORD.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, there is an old adage--and I have heard it many times, and so have you and our other colleagues--that, ``March comes in like a lion and leaves like a lamb.'' That adage was certainly turned on its ear this year. March tiptoed in on little lamb's hooves, as soft and warm as a curly fleece, giving us all hope of an early, mild spring. 
   Aha. The smiles that have lighted up the faces here in the pages and the officers of the Senate and the employees of  the Senate who sit before me here when I mentioned that word ``spring.'' 
   In West Virginia, the center of the world--half the world on one side, half the world on the other--West Virginia, early daffodils pushed through great rafts of dried leaves washed up against old stone farmhouse foundations that jut like rocky reefs out of sunny hillsides. Oh, the iridescent sunsets and the viridescent hills that are West Virginia's. Bluebirds decorated telephone line perches while forsythia blossoms announced the awakening of the Earth. 
   Then the March lion roared with a vengeance, sending successive storm waves across the Nation. Snow buried the daffodils under a crystalline blanket of sparkling white. West Virginia was hit hard by these late storms, as were many other States. What was a boon for skiers and schoolchildren has been a real hardship for commerce and commuters. 
   But now, as the vernal equinox and the official first day of spring approaches, we can all look forward to the lion at last lying down with the lamb. It is time, as the poet Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837-1909), wrote in ``Atlanta in Calydon'': 
 For winter's rains and ruins are over,  And all the season of snows and sins; The days dividing lover and lover,  The light that loses, the night that wins; And time remembered is grief forgotten,  And frosts are slain and flowers begotten, And green underwood and cover  Blossom by blossom the spring begins.  
   Once again, the warm sun encourages us to consider folding away our scarves, our gloves, and our overcoats, retiring the snow shovel to the shed, and pulling out instead the trowel and the seed packets. 
   How many of us have enjoyed looking at those seed packets and fancying ourselves as young farmers, how we would grow these cucumbers, or these tomatoes, or this lettuce, or these onions, or the potatoes? 
   What promise is contained in seed packets! What a joy. Reading garden catalogs during cold, dark winter days inspires small-scale gardeners like myself with dreams of grandeur. Ah, fancy myself growing these beautiful vegetables. Ah. I am sure that others have shared that pleasantry with me many times. A few tomato plants are all that I really have the time for, but for me those humble plants with the spicy scent, their soft leaves and glossy fruits--Better Boy, Big Boy, Beefsteak, Early Girl--a few tomato plants are all that I really have the time for, but for me, those humble plants with their spicy scent, their soft leaves and glossy fruits, serve each year to reconnect me with cycles of nature. In my few tomato plants, I share with farmers throughout the Nation worries about cold spells, early frosts, drought, excessive rainfall, fungus, and insect infestation. But, like those farmers throughout the Nation, I glory in the success of my efforts, and my family and neighbors--mostly my family--share in the bounties of those tomato plants. 
   How can one even dare to believe that there is no God, no Creator? Why do I put those tomato plants in the ground? Why? I have confidence that the Creator of man and the universe is going to make those tomato plants bear some fruit. 
   And this year I will delight in introducing the newest member of my family, too--I say to our distinguished leader, a new member of my family--a dainty great-granddaughter, Caroline Byrd Fatemi; wait until I introduce her to my garden. She was born just 2 weeks ago yesterday. So small and precious now, she will grow strong and happy in the sunshine. And perhaps someday she too will grow some tomatoes. 
   I do love the promise of the spring. 
   William Jennings Bryan spoke of the Father, the Creator:  
   If the Father deigns to touch with divine power the cold and pulseless heart of the buried acorn and to make it burst forth from its prison walls, will He leave neglected in the Earth the soul of man made in the image of his Creator? 
   If He stoops to give to the rosebush whose withered blossoms float upon the autumn breeze, the sweet assurance of another springtime, will He refuse the words of hope to the sons of men when the frosts of winter come?  
   I do love the promise of the spring. Every place is better for springtime's artistry. There exists no imposing monument of granite or marble that is not improved by a softening verdigris of springtime green, highlighted by bright blooms. Washington is at its best in April and May, under bright skies and tossing cherry blossoms, with all of its governmental mass leavened by leaves. Spring travels a little slower to the hillsides of West Virginia, but it is, perhaps, all the more cherished for blooming later. There, in the deep shadows of the hills where rhododendron thickets outline quiet chapels among the cathedral of the trees, greening springtime coincides in harmony with God's Easter promise of resurrection. 
   I encourage my colleagues, and everyone else, too, to shake off the last of the winter blahs and go outside. Go early in the morning when the birds sing in grand chorus, or in the blinding brightness of noon, or in the lilac serenity of evening, but go outside. Go outside and breathe in the scent of hyacinths and fresh-turned earth. Plant a garden. Plant a single tomato seedling and join in the great community of gardeners and farmers and lovers of the earth. But do enjoy the springtime. It resurrects the spirit.  
   I asked the Robin as he sprang 
   From branch to branch and sweetly sang 
   What made his breast so round and red 
   ``Twas looking at the sun,'' he said.  
   And I asked the violets sweet and blue, 
   Sparkling in the morning dew, 
   Whence came their colors, then so shy, 
   They answered, ``Looking to the sky.''  
   I saw the roses one by one 
   Unfold their petals to the sun. 
   I asked them what made their tints so bright, 
   And they answered, ``Looking toward the light.''  
   I asked the thrush whose silvery note 
   Came like a song from angel's throat, 
   Why he sang in the twilight dim. 
   He answered, ``Looking up at Him.''  
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. CLELAND addressed the Chair.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I don't know about eloquence, but I can say that the Senator from Mississippi always carries a warm smile. I have not been noted for smiling. I once read a story by Nathaniel Hawthorne entitled, ``The Great Stone Face.'' And so I usually think of myself, in the context of that story, as the great stone face. But the distinguished Senator from Mississippi is always bubbling with energy, always on the move, always wearing a smile, always with twinkling eyes. He brings a lift to the spirits of all of us. I congratulate him. I know that grandchild of his is always going to carry the picture in his little mind of that grandfather with that sparkling, radiant smile.

   Mr. BYRD. Yes, if the distinguished majority leader would. 
   I am glad he has spoken as he has. I don't know how much the American people know about, really, what we face. And I am not sure I know, by any means. I am sure that Congress has certain constitutional responsibilities and that when it comes to sending American men and women into war, into conflict, into danger, Congress also bears part of the responsibility. I am fearful that in recent years especially, American Presidents in both parties have not recognized that fact, and they have, sent men and women into areas of peril without taking the Congress along with them. 
   I think we learned in Vietnam that unless the American people are behind an effort such as that, it cannot succeed. I believe that Congress ought to fulfill its duties. But I also believe that Congress has to take a stand and demand that its constitutional prerogatives be recognized. No President can carry on a war without the support of Congress or without the support of the American people. I am sure the distinguished majority leader feels the same way about it. We are on the edge of a great precipice here of national danger. And what is happening in the Balkans is something that should be of great concern to all of us and to the people of the world. 
   It was from that area, may I say to my friend, that the Roman legions procured their fiercest fighters. There has been turmoil and fighting in that area of the world for hundreds and hundreds of years. We are seeing there today an individual, Mr. Milosevic, who has a strong will and who is absolutely ruthless in his determination to subjugate and to massacre and to exterminate other peoples. 
   The President needs to get out front and tell the American people why it is, if we are going to send our men and women into conflict there. If we are going to send planes in there, some of those planes may be shot down. Americans may be held hostage. Americans may be killed. The American people need to know what we are about to do and why and what the end game is and what the exit strategy is, what the motivations are, what the costs are going to be, before we get out there on a limb and have a lot of people killed. 
   I hope the President will take the lead. Sandy Berger or the Secretary of State or even the Vice President cannot speak for the one man in the country who is the President of the United States, whether he is a Democrat or Republican. The President has the responsibility to get out front, tell the American people what we face and if we are about to send men and women into war, and when this will end, if we ever go there, ever begin bombing. We need to know this. The President needs the Congress behind him. He can't do this alone. He needs the Congress behind him. He needs Republicans and Democrats. We can only be behind him if we understand what we are being asked to do. We don't really understand. 
   I compliment the majority leader and the minority leader for requesting--they should not have to request this--this hearing in the presence of the President of the United States. That is the man we need to hear from. He is the man who has to put his name on the line. He has to get out front. He has to tell the American people the truth, and he has to tell Congress. He has to keep Congress informed. He must not get out too far in front of Congress, because, otherwise, he will look behind him and wonder where the troops are one day, meaning the congressional battalions. 
   I thank the distinguished majority leader.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as the Congress works to provide billions of dollars to address a crisis affecting our neighbors abroad who have had their lives disrupted overnight by raging waters, I have become more and more concerned about another water-related crisis occurring every day in this nation. That crisis is the lack of a safe, reliable supply of drinking water for millions of rural American families. Since 1995, federal data outlining the sorry details of the safe drinking water crisis have been available and, yet, year after year, adequate funding for water and wastewater projects that would solve this crisis is not provided. Last night, my distinguished colleagues joined Senator STEVENS and me in sending a message to rural Americans that their crisis is not forgotten. 
   Yesterday evening, the Senate adopted an amendment offered by myself and Senator STEVENS to the supplemental appropriations bill that would provide $30 million in additional funds for rural water and wastewater systems. This money would benefit the neediest of rural communities that are affected by extreme conditions that increase the cost of constructing water and wastewater systems, that have a high incidence of health problems related to water supply and poor sanitary conditions, or whose residents are suffering from a high rate of poverty. 
   Within the $30 million in budget authority provided in this amendment, $5 million would be allocated for loans and $25 million for grants. The result would be a total program level of $55,303,000. The reality of this funding is that this year, an additional 25 or more communities throughout the United States would get some relief from the fear of an inadequate, unsafe supply of drinking water. 
   Safe, reliable drinking water is not an amenity. Safe drinking water is essential to the health and well-being of every American. All life as we know it depends on the necessary element of water. 
   Most Americans take safe drinking water for granted. Most Americans just assume that when they turn on the faucet, clean water will automatically flow out of the faucet. They assume that there will always be easy access to an unlimited supply of clean, safe drinking water. 
   The terrible truth is that, in the United States of America, the health of millions of men, 
   women, and children is made vulnerable by their reliance on a possibly contaminated water supply. 
   According to statistics from 1998, approximately 2.2 million rural Americans live with critical quality and accessibility problems related to their drinking water, including an estimated 730,000 American citizens who have no running water in their homes. Let me repeat that--an estimated 730,000 people have no running water in their homes. An additional five million rural Americans are affected by grave, although less critical, water problems, such as water sources that are over-taxed or poorly protected, and by antiquated distribution systems. The very young and the elderly are placed at particular risk of illnesses caused by unsafe, unclean, drinking water, and many towns without a reliable supply of water cannot even protect residents from the threat of fire. 
   This funding provided in our amendment is desperately needed to address conditions in West Virginia and much of Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, in rural and native Alaskan villages, the Colonias, and in Indian Reservations. Senator STEVENS has been working hard to get the necessary funds for an authorized program for rural development in several Alaskan Native villages. I understand that while the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is trying to help, funding simply is not there for the water and wastewater systems that are the backbone of any development proposal. Our amendment specifically directs funds through the national reserve in an effort to serve the deserving families in Alaska in a timely manner. 
   In my own state of West Virginia, families in towns such as Pageton, Belington, and Crum must deal with the normal family worries of providing food, shelter, and a sound education to their children. Can you imagine the frustration that these families face every day in having to further protect their children from a foul or unreliable source of water! I am not talking about water that smells bad or tastes funny. I am talking about water that must be boiled before consumption, or that flows--when it flows--like opaque brown sludge from their taps. This is water not fit to wash a car, let alone to cook with or to mix with baby formula. That simply should not be, in a nation as rich in resources as we are. 
   A good part of the supplemental provides assistance for disaster recovery in other nations. This amendment reaches out to Americans in crisis. It gives hope to rural America that a brighter future lies ahead, a future flowing as bright and clear as the water out of their tap.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the security of this nation in an increasingly insecure world remains the highest priority of the United States government. To that end, we support and finance the most powerful military in the world. Our troops have the most advanced weapons available. We have gifted and dedicated military strategists at the helm. 
   And yet we remain vulnerable, in some ways perhaps more so today than we were at the height of the Cold War. The increased sophistication, radicalization, and financial acumen of terrorist organizations have escalated the threat of terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. The increased interdependence and complexity of computer networks has intensified the threat of potentially devastating cyber attacks on critical defense and domestic communications systems. And despite the end of the Cold War, the proliferation of nuclear weapons technology, particularly among rogue states, has brought with it a renewed threat of nuclear attack on our homeland. 
   North Korea, Iraq, and Iran are all working furiously to produce nuclear weapons systems that could threaten the sovereign territory of the United States. To our dismay, we have discovered that North Korea, one of the most belligerent outlaw nations in the world, is much further along than previously thought in its efforts to produce a nuclear warhead capable of reaching our shores. The threat from North Korea is sooner rather than later; here rather than there. China, with whom our relations are increasingly strained, has boasted of its possession of a ballistic missile that could reach Los Angeles. Russia, with an arsenal of thousands of nuclear weapons left over from the Cold War, is faced with a crumbling military infrastructure and increasingly empty assurances regarding the security of its nuclear stockpile. 
   In short, we are living in dangerous times. The Administration has taken a number of steps in recent months to accelerate its efforts to protect the U.S. mainland from attack. As part of that effort, the President has budgeted an additional $6.6 billion dollars to develop a National Missile Defense, or NMD. The legislation that we are considering today, S. 257, the National Missile Defense Act of 1999, puts the United States Senate firmly on record as endorsing the urgency of that program. As a result of several carefully crafted amendments that have been overwhelmingly adopted, this bill has gained strong bipartisan support. Senators COCHRAN, LEVIN, LANDRIEU, and  the many others who have worked to reach consensus on this bill are to be commended. 
   I support the National Missile Defense Act of 1999 as amended. But, from the vantage point of many years of experience, I also offer a few words of caution. Let us not allow 
   the determination to press for a ballistic missile shield to blind us to other, perhaps greater, threats of sabotage. The technology exists, and is available to those same rogue nations, to develop and deploy chemical and biological weapons without the need for a ballistic missile delivery system. A few vials of anthrax, a test tube full of the smallpox virus, some innocuous canisters of sarin gas, could wreak chaos of unimaginable proportion in the United States. These threats are as real as the threat of a ballistic missile attack, and, if anything, more urgent. 
   A second cautionary note: let us not allow our eagerness to develop a missile defense system blind us to the cost of developing such a system. In our zeal to erect a national missile shield, the danger exists of committing such a vast array of resources--money, people, research priorities--that we could shortchange other necessary initiatives to protect our national security. We need a balanced national security program, of which a missile defense is but one element. 
   We have gone down the road of throwing money at this threat before, with the ABM system in the 1970's and SDI in the 1980's. Both efforts cost us billions of dollars, oceans of ink, years of wasted effort. Neither, in the end, made one iota of difference to our national security. Technological feasibility should be the starting point, not the defining element, of a missile defense system. Let us learn from the past. Invest wisely. Test carefully. Assess constantly. This is not the arena in which to allow partisan politics or political one-upmanship to hold sway. This is a matter of far too great consequence to this and future generations. The bipartisan negotiations and the spirit of compromise that have marked the Senate debate over this bill give me cause to hope that this time, we will do it right. Let us continue to work together toward an effective, realistic, and prudent national defense system. 
   Finally, let us not for a moment forget the importance of working actively and diligently to reduce the number of existing nuclear warheads and curb the proliferation of nuclear weapons. A national missile defense system that precipitates a global arms race is in no one's best interest. 
   We cannot safely assume that today's geopolitical alliances will be the same tomorrow. A weak and politically chaotic Russia may be not seen as much of a threat to our security today--at least not intentionally--but as it has done before, the situation in Russia could change in the blink of an eye. We have at hand the means and the will and the opportunity to work with Russia to reduce nuclear warheads. Yes, we must take all necessary precautions to protect our security, but we must not be so shortsighted as to let this opportunity for meaningful arms control be muscled aside through misguided belligerence. 
   With care and planning, we can make progress in both arms control and missile defense. How well we will succeed on both fronts remains to be seen, but S. 257 as amended is a good first step.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today we celebrate the life of the patron saint of Ireland known popularly as Saint Patrick. Saint Patrick's given name was actually Maewyn and he was born in Wales about 385 A.D. Many of us, whether we have a drop of bonafide Irish blood or not, will have donned something green today, in honor of the great spirit and rich traditions of the Irish people, and of their substantial contributions in all walks of life to this, their adopted homeland. 
   Right here in the Senate we can see the brilliant legacy of the Irish gene pool personified in the physical presence of some of our most outstanding Members. 
   I note that one of these sons of Ireland celebrated his 72nd birthday on yesterday--merely a young lad in my eyes. That illustrious son of Ireland is none other than the Honorable DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN. Although I am honored to wish this amazing gentleman the happiest of birthdays, my heart hangs heavy with the knowledge that all too soon this incredible man will be leaving this body. He has announced his retirement from the United States Senate, commencing with the end of this Congress. 
   In this coming year, we will celebrate his life and his achievements, but I cannot emphasize enough what a loss this body will have suffered when the senior Senator from New York, Mr. MOYNIHAN, no longer graces this Chamber. He is, quite literally, irreplaceable.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, S. 544, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations and Rescissions Bill for Fiscal Year 1999, as reported by the committee, recommends appropriations which total some $1.9 billion, of which approximately $1.6 billion is designated as emergency spending pursuant to Section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended. 
   Very importantly, in Title I of the bill, the Committee unanimously approved provisions that I included to establish the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program. This initiative is designed to respond to record levels of foreign steel imports that have been illegally dumped in U.S. markets. As a result of these imports, more than 10,000 American jobs have been lost, and the United Steelworkers of America estimates that another 100,000 jobs are in peril nationwide. In my home state of West Virginia, nearly 800 men and women have been laid off from Weirton Steel. Three domestic producers have already filed for bankruptcy, and others are in dire financial straits. 
   If the U.S. steel industry goes under, not only will there be lost jobs, but there will also be lost communities; the domestic industrial base that underpins our security will be irreparably weakened; and the nation's defense readiness will be diminished. 
   This initiative, cosponsored in Committee by Senators SPECTER, DURBIN, SHELBY, and HOLLINGS, would create a revolving fund to give domestic steelmakers a sorely needed infusion of capital. The program, which is fully compliant with international trade laws, would give cash-strapped companies access to the funding they may need to keep their furnaces burning and keep workers on the job until proper trade mechanisms can be implemented to end this crisis. The loan guarantees would help to bolster the financial security of a threatened industry that is critical to this nation's economic base and domestic security. 
   Specifically, the guaranteed loan program would provide qualified U.S. steel producers with access to a two-year, $1 billion revolving guaranteed loan fund. The minimum loan that would be guaranteed for a single company at any one time would be $25 million, and the aggregate amount of loans that would be guaranteed for a single company over the duration of the program would be $250 million. A board, to be chaired by the Secretary of Commerce, would oversee the program 
   and would have flexibility to determine the specific requirements for awarding the guaranteed loans. The Act protects taxpayers by requiring that a reasonable assurance for the repayment of the loans exists, and that the loans would bear market interest rates. 
   Finally, in Title I, the committee increased FEMA's emergency disaster assistance funding by $313.6 million, while at the same time reducing a like amount from HUD's Community Development Block Grant emergency funding. The VA/HUD Subcommittee was concerned over HUD's failure to implement an effective emergency disaster relief program. The committee felt that FEMA could more appropriately respond to unmet disaster needs throughout the nation. 
   Title II of the bill contains a number of appropriations for regular supplemental budget requests of the administration, including: NOAA operations research and facilities activities, $3,900,000; Salaries and Expenses of the  Supreme Court, $921,000; Bureau of Indian Affairs, $1,136,000; Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians, $6,800,000; Corporation for Public Broadcasting, $18,000,000; and Military Construction for the Army National Guard, $11,300,000. 
   For each of these regular supplementals, offsets have been included in the bill. 
   Title II also provides non-emergency supplemental appropriations of $210 million for the Department of Defense to reimburse the DOD for its assistance in Central America, as well as $80 million in non-emergency appropriations for the salaries and expenses of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to cover increased costs of handling the large influx of aliens from Central American countries. Both of these items have been requested by the administration as emergency spending, but the Defense and Commerce/Justice/State Subcommittees chose to fully offset these appropriations and to include them in Title II as non-emergency spending. 
   I note that Title II also contains a number of general provisions, one of which, Section 2008, extends the Airport Improvement Program which under present law, would expire on March 31, 1999. Additionally, section 2011, is a general provision which prohibits the Federal Government from recouping any of the savings to the Medicaid program achieved by the States as a result of their tobacco settlements. 
   Title III of the bill contains rescissions sufficient to offset all of the emergency 
   appropriations contained in the bill. It is my personal view that emergency spending for natural disasters and for unanticipated military spending, such as the operations in Desert Fox and Kosovo, as well as the military's assistance to the disaster victims in Central America need not be offset. In fact, I participated in the creation of the provisions in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act, which allow emergency spending to be provided in order to respond to natural disasters and other types of emergencies without having to come up with offsets to pay for those unpredictable events. The emergency designation was negotiated as part of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, in large part because the discretionary budget caps established there, and which have remained in place each year since, are very tight. I have never felt that the American people should be required to pay for spending which appropriately qualifies as emergency relief under that Budget Enforcement Act. If that is to be the case, we need not have gone to the trouble of adopting the emergency provisions I have just described. 
   Regarding the specific rescissions proposed in Title III of the bill now before the Senate, I know that a number of Senators have concerns about one or the other of those rescissions. I am certain that the concerns of those Senators will be expressed as the Senate progresses with this bill. 
   I urge my colleagues to help the managers of the bill, the distinguished chairman, Senator STEVENS, and myself, in expediting completion of Senate action in time to meet with the other body and complete conference action on the bill prior to the upcoming Easter recess. 
   I especially commend the work of the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. STEVENS. For many years, I have worked with the Senator from Alaska. I have always found him to be evenhanded, courteous, congenial, cooperative, and very able in handling the difficult legislation on the floor, in committee and in conference. He is my friend, has been my friend through the years, and will always be my friend. I consider it a great privilege and a honor, indeed, to be able to stand by his side and express support for this legislation. I count it a privilege to work with him. He is one of the finest Senators with whom I have ever had the pleasure of serving. I have served with almost 300 Senators in my time here. I say that without any reservations. I salute him, believe in him, trust him, and can count him not only as my friend but as a very fine Senator. The people of Alaska are to be commended for sending him here and sending him back repeatedly. 
   The assistance provided in this bill to the people of this country, as well as those in Central America, is desperately needed. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am honored today to join my colleagues in saluting one of our own, Senator BOB KERREY of Nebraska, for the courage and heroism that he displayed as a U.S. Navy SEAL 30 years ago, and for the courage and determination that he continues to inspire today. 
   The United States Senate is no stranger to heroes. Through the centuries, this Chamber has embraced the souls of some of the greatest heroes of our nation. It still does. We are privileged to work among heroes every day, individuals like BOB KERREY, STROM THURMOND, DANNY INOUYE, JOHN MCCAIN, and MAX CLELAND. 
   I hope we never take the courage of these individuals for granted, or lose sight of the great legacy of their predecessors. Certainly, among the history of heroism in the Senate, BOB KERREY's story is one of inspiration. Horribly injured by a grenade, he nevertheless carried on an attack against the Viet Cong and led his men to victory. His bravery won for him the highest honor that the United States government can bestow upon an individual for valor: the Congressional Medal of Honor. But his act of courage also took a great toll. It cost him his leg, challenged his spirit, and threatened to taint his life with bitterness.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have no doubt that S. Con. Res. 5 is a well-intentioned effort by the members of this body to express their opposition to any unilateral declaration of statehood by the Palestinians. I support that position--such a reckless action on the part of the Palestinians would be disastrous to the Middle East peace process-- but I cannot support this resolution. It is, in my opinion, ill-timed and unnecessary. 
   The Administration has made clear its opposition to any unilateral action that would preempt the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. But the Palestinians are not the only players in this drama. The Israelis are also partners in the peace process, and have an equal stake in refraining from provocative and destabilizing actions. This resolution, however, does not address the responsibilities of the Israelis. 
   If Yasser Arafat has not yet gotten the message that the United States is opposed to a unilateral declaration of statehood, this non-binding resolution is not sufficient to drive the point home. But it contains the kind of rhetoric that could be used by those who wish to further disrupt the peace process. Given the tensions inherent in the efforts to negotiate a peaceful settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians, the Congress should not take up what amounts to little more than a self-serving resolution that may do more harm than good. 
   If the United States Congress wishes to make a meaningful contribution to  the Middle East peace process, we should, first, keep pressure on both sides to negotiate in good faith and to avoid provocative words or actions, and second, we should act promptly when the Administration sends to Congress its request for supplemental appropriations to implement the Wye River peace agreement. In this way, we can demonstrate our commitment to peace in the Middle East without adding fuel to an already incendiary situation.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have long been concerned about our nation's education system and the many problems that individual classes across the country grapple with every day. When I reflect on my days in a two-room schoolhouse, I have fond memories of my teachers and classmates, and, most importantly, my learning experience. The students were disciplined, my teachers were serious about their work, classes were small and well-kept, and students thrived on learning for learning's own sake. We did not have the kinds of problems so common in schools today. 
   I do, however, recognize that with each passing year, educating our nation's children becomes an even more formidable challenge. I am pleased that we were able to address a few of the many concerns facing parents, students, and educators as part of the Senate's debate on this bill, S. 280, the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999. With classrooms bursting at their seams with students, there is a definite need for smaller class size. Students do better when they have the individual attention of a teacher. Moreover, I believe that this kind of environment provides teachers and students with a setting truly conducive to quality instruction. We, as a nation, need to do more in this regard. 
   But, Mr. President, there are also other pressing education priorities for states, including funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which remains underfunded to date. Disabled children deserve the same opportunity to receive a good education as those without a disability. I am hopeful that we in Congress will continue to build toward the forty-percent funding commitment that was established as part of the IDEA legislation. I believe, however, that reducing class size and providing for the needs of disabled children are both worthy goals that are not mutually exclusive, and I am troubled that efforts to provide sufficient resources to achieve one of those goals may have the effect of undercutting the other. The notion of pitting these two worthy goals against one another to score partisan political points is embarrassing. Certainly, both can, and should, be accomplished. 
   While many important education programs and new initiatives have been discussed during the Senate's debate of S. 280, I believe that the underlying legislation offers some benefits in the form of flexibility. I do have concerns that there is little substantive performance data on the impact of Ed-Flex in the states now operating with it. I would have preferred to see some positive results on student achievement levels prior to making this type of expansion. But I am hopeful that the education accountability built into this legislation will hold states to a higher standard and serve as an incentive to all states seeking Ed-Flex status. I am also somewhat comforted by the fact that the bill contains a sunset provision, which will force the Congress to revisit this issue, and, I hope, live up to its oversight responsibilities. 
   Mr. President, it disturbs me greatly to witness the political divide in this body on such an important issue which affects us all, whether it be our own child's education, that of a grandchild, or a neighbor's child. We are all for education--it is the country's number one priority, and with many problems to solve, it is time for us to work together to make every child's educational experience a rewarding one.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as we approach the vote to invoke cloture on S. 280, the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1998, I wish to express my dismay with the procedural battle evoked by this legislation. We have now spent close to three full days on this bill, but the Senate has expended most of its time and energy on procedural tactics intended to preclude one party or the other from debating those topics of utmost importance to them. I find this greatly disturbing. Education is a serious topic which deserves the substantive attention of this body. It merits an in-depth examination from a multitude of levels and angles so that our nation's children can someday reap the full benefit of a well-rounded learning experience. With so many priority items to discuss and debate in this Congress, there is, of course, great difficulty with accommodating and balancing the wishes of 100 Senators, but I hope that we could come to an understanding by which Republicans and Democrats alike could use this opportunity to further discuss and debate education policy. People all across the United States from California to Maine tell us that education is their top priority. Obviously there are concerns. Can we not set aside our differences and use this opportunity to help address the many problems facing our nation's education system? 
   As part of this debate on the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1998, I would like to take some time to discuss the issue of education accountability, a topic which has received much attention from my colleagues during these past few days. I am pleased to note that greater accountability has been built into this legislation to ensure that states granted this so-called Ed-Flex status are held to higher standards of accountability in exchange for increased flexibility at the state level. I am, however, reluctant to support the notion of expanding this Ed-Flex designation nationwide, given the limited performance results from the twelve demonstration states and the lack of accountability data on which a state or school currently reports. Perhaps, before embarking on this mission of handing over greater authority to states to waive federal education requirements, we should consider the somewhat startling fact that more than sixty percent of parents have never seen an individual report card on the performance of their area school. 
   I find it ironic that, in an age where a wealth of information abounds about any imaginable field, precious little information exists about the performance of our nation's schools. Mr. President, I bring to the attention of the Senate a recent publication by Education Week and A-Plus Communications, entitled ``Reporting Results,'' that discusses this new buzzword of 1999. While I find encouraging the fact, as reported in Education Week, that thirty-six states are expected to issue school accountability data or ``report cards'' this year, that practice, it seems to me, should be undertaken by all fifty states. 
   Furthermore, of the thirty-six states that will have report cards in 1999, only thirteen states ensure that the report cards actually get sent home to parents and few include all the information that parents report that they actually want to see most. Moreover, the information on these report cards rarely finds its way to the community at large, which has an interest in the education of its young people. I am baffled by this phenomenon! Why go through the process of creating such a document for it to end up as yet another soiled piece of paper in the garbage can? And without this kind of documentation from schools, should we really be proceeding with the expansion of Ed-Flex authority to waive certain federal education requirements without significant knowledge of how our nation's schools are performing in the first place? 
   Of all the decisions in life that a parent has to make, the decision about where to send a child to school is one of the most difficult and important. I find it unbelievable to think that parents often, for the lack of better information, rely upon word-of-mouth to make such important decisions. Where are the numbers on student achievement, test scores, teacher certification, and graduation rates? Parents need to have this information before them as a key resource for making an informed decision. 
   I feel for parents who, despite their best efforts to learn about the quality of their local schools, cross their fingers as they send their children off each day in the hope that their children will be spending those hours in an enriching and safe environment. I find it terribly disconcerting that the quality of our schools in different corners of the same community can differ so dramatically as to force families to move from neighborhood to neighborhood on the trail of the best schools. I find it sad that so many families have felt compelled to give up on public schools in favor of private schools or home schooling. 
   Mr. President, I believe that greater education accountability is the key to unlocking this trend burdening so many families today. With more information, and I am talking about the real stuff--test scores, teacher qualifications, graduation rates, tracking of students from grade school into college and after--parents will have substantive data at their fingertips to truly determine what is in the best interest of their child and their family as a whole. Perhaps, at the same time, this could provide a better framework for gauging how Ed-Flex is impacting student achievement levels and enhancing teacher preparation. 
   Competition is at the heart of creating better schools for the nation. During this debate, my colleagues will raise the important issues of school construction, class-size reduction, and others of great concern to the American people, but I believe that fostering a competitive environment among schools is perhaps one of the more simple and effective ways of improving our nation's schools for the 21st century. 
   By forcing schools to annually report on performance data, such as test scores and other quantitative measures, teacher qualifications, and safety indicators, parents will have a framework for weighing one school against another, and communities will have data they need to force improvements in their school systems. As Education Week pointed out in its report, so many of the report cards that actually make their way into a parents' hands are difficult to read, with extraneous information of little benefit to educators and parents. Mr. President, there needs to be uniformity in gathering key data that parents are seeking and a model that all parents can follow. Holding schools accountable for the students they are producing and the teachers they have chosen, while making this information readily available to parents, will turn up the heat on schools, and apply much long-needed pressure to those at the helm to up the ante on teacher qualifications and curriculum requirements. 
   But test scores and other achievement data will mean little to parents if we continue upon this so-called trend of ``teaching to the test.'' What good will come of teaching students skills simply to ace a standardized test? Mr. President, if we hope to produce well-rounded students prepared for the challenges ahead in today's workforce, a standardized test should not drive the curriculum. Life is not multiple choice. Life is an essay, to be written well or poorly by educated students. 
   Education accountability is a serious issue which has been left behind for many years at the expense of our nation's parents and educators. It is time to examine the necessity for reporting data both as part of this Ed-Flex legislation and at the local level in the form of school report cards. I look forward to working with the Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions Committee in ensuring that our nation begins to navigate this challenging territory. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, there is no question that America's armed forces are the best in the world. The men and women who serve in our military demonstrate their courage and dedication every day, from the fighter pilots who are making life-threatening raids into Iraq to contain the deadly forces of Saddam Hussein, to the soldiers who are maintaining peace in the war-weary towns of Bosnia, to the countless sailors, soldiers, and airmen on lonely patrol throughout the world, enduring hardship and homesickness to protect their fellow Americans. It is vital to our national security that we maintain the level of excellence that these troops represent. 
   Of the many factors that contribute to the robustness of our military, none is more basic than the ability to recruit and retain qualified, talented individuals. Without enough people to operate them, our mightiest weapons are worthless. Without enough people to execute them, our best planned strategies are useless. Without enough people in uniform to defend it, our nation is at risk. 
   We ask much of the men and women who serve in our military, and of their families as well. Yet, as we have learned from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, pay and benefit levels for members of the armed services have been slipping behind those of their civilian counterparts. Today, we are facing a personnel shortfall of alarming proportions. The need for the legislation before us is acute. According to recent published reports, the Army fell 2,300 short of its recruiting goal--approximately a 20 percent deficit--in the first quarter of fiscal year 1999. The Navy missed its recruitment target by almost 7,000 last year. The Air Force, which has suffered a hemorrhage of pilots over the past several years, fell 400 short of its first quarter goal. 
   Many factors are contributing to the current recruitment and retention problems of the services, but military leaders across the services and up and down the chain of command have identified pay and benefits as major culprits. We need to come to grips with this problem. In my state of West Virginia, approximately 9,000 men and women serve around the world in the active and reserve armed forces. They are subject to being called away at a moment's notice to some of the most dangerous trouble spots on earth. The least we can do for them in return is to make sure that their families will be able to make ends meet while they are deployed away from home. The least we can do is strive to ensure that the monthly paychecks we issue to our men and women in uniform are comparable to that of their civilian counterparts. 
   Improving the pay and benefits of the men and women who serve in our military is an obvious first step to help reverse the downward spiral in recruitment and retention, and I applaud the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator WARNER, for moving quickly to address this situation. Likewise, I applaud Senator LEVIN, the Ranking Member of the Committee, for insisting that the benchmarks of prudence and careful consideration be met in the bill before us. This legislation is not the place for grandstanding or political one-upmanship. I am hopeful that as we debate this bill over the coming days, we will work for the common good of our military and our nation, and come up with a balanced, commonsense bill. 
   I hope, also, that we will be mindful, as we consider this bill, that monetary compensation is only one factor affecting recruiting and retention levels in the military. Plainly put, we cannot buy the finest military in the world. To rise to the level of excellence that the United States military has achieved requires an uncommon degree of dedication, self-sacrifice, and patriotism--qualities that can be inspired and nurtured but not bought. By all means, let us work together to improve the compensation of our men and women in uniform. But let us also work together to preserve and enhance the intangible compensations of military service--the honor, respect, and sense of accomplishment--that form the true foundation of military service.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today I speak in memory of Raymond Scott Bates, one of the dear members of our own Senate family who recently departed this life. 
 Let Fate do her worst, there are relics of joy, Bright dreams of the past, which she cannot destroy; Which come, in the night-time of sorrow and care, And bring back the features that joy used to wear. Long, long be my heart with such memories filled, Like the vase in which roses have once been distilled, You may break, you may shatter the vase, if you will, But the scent of the roses will hang round it still.  
   These words, written by Thomas Moore, are so fitting this afternoon, as I, in my limited and feeble way, attempt to pay honor and tribute to the life of Scott Bates, a man whom we all admired and respected, and who was taken from our midst, virtually in the twinkle of an eye, and without warning. 
   It was on the evening of February 5 that the pallid messenger beckoned Scott to depart this life. We can believe that he awakened to see a more glorious sunrise with unimaginable splendor above a celestial horizon, and that he yet remembers us as we remember him, for we have the consolation that has come down to us from the lips of that ancient man of Uz, whose name was Job, ``Oh that my words were written in a book and engraved with an iron pen, and lead in the rock forever, for I know that my Redeemer liveth and that in the latter day He shall stand upon the earth.'' 
   When Erma and I lost our dear grandson, Michael, now almost 17 years ago, I felt that Michael was resting and at peace in the arms of God, and deep within my soul I was aware that Michael knew of my grief. He, too, was taken from us suddenly and without warning, and he left us without a wave of a hand or without saying goodbye, and so Erma and I know what this family is going through. We, too, have walked through the valley of the shadow of death. And Erma and I join in saying to Scott's family today, Scott knows of your grief. 
   I have known Scott Bates since the very first day that he became a member of the Senate family. I watched him grow. I watched him as he increased in knowledge and in his love for the Senate. Often, when I was the Democratic Leader in the Senate, and many times since, I had the occasion to call upon Scott for help. He was always ready, always courteous, always accommodating. From time to time, we talked about the Senate and how it was different from what it used to be. He was a Senate employee whose time in the Senate extended beyond the tenure of many of the Members of this body, and, like many of the men and women who have toiled here in the Senate over the years, Scott appreciated the Senate, loved it, and understood it, better even than many of its own Members loved and understood it. His contributions to the Senate have been many and notable. 
   Although public service in general and careers in Washington have, in some quarters, fallen out of favor, I believe that Scott Bates' life and work experience present a compelling case against the current cynicism about the many fine people who serve in the Senate in various capacities. Their names are never in the newspapers, they experience few public kudos, and yet they work as long hours, probably longer, than we do. They are dedicated, they are capable, they are patriotic individuals who represent the best that America has to offer from all over this Nation. 
   Scott was one of those rare individuals about whom no unkind and ungenerous word was ever, ever spoken by anyone who knew him. 
   He personified what we politicians like to refer to as ``family values.'' He lived them. He was active in his church, and he loved his wife, Ricki, and their three lovely children--Lisa, Lori, and Paul. 
   As all of us know, one of Scott's official duties as legislative clerk was to call the roll of the Senate during votes and during quorum calls. Thousands of times--thousands of times, I have heard him call my name: ``Mr. Byrd''. Now the thread of life is cut; the immortal is separated from the mortal; and that rich voice which was wont to fill the walls of the Senate Chamber, is hushed in eternal silence. But while the portals of the tomb have closed upon the remains of a gifted member of the Senate family, the grave is powerless to hold in its bosom the spirit of man. 
   In the words of William Jennings Bryan, ``if the Father stoops to give to the rose bush, whose withered blossoms float upon the autumn breeze, the sweet assurance of another springtime, will he refuse the words of hope to the sons of men when the frosts of winter come? If matter, mute and inanimate, though changed into a multitude of forms can never be destroyed, will the imperial spirit of man suffer annihilation when it has paid a brief visit like a royal guest to this tenement of clay? No, I am sure that He who, notwithstanding His apparent prodigality, created nothing without a purpose, and wasted not a single atom in all His creation, has made provision for a future life in which man's universal longing for immortality will find its realization. I am sure that we shall live again,'' as sure as I am that we live today, and I am also sure that someday I shall hear the voice of a new angel, calling my name again, this time on the heavenly rolls: ``Mr. Byrd.'' 
   To Lisa, to Lori and to Paul, I think your father would have wanted me to say, live as he taught you to live and strive always to make him proud, because he knows. 
   On Saturday afternoon, we gathered in a church in Vienna. It was a large church, a Presbyterian Church. Our Senate Chaplain was there. He had arranged the program, and he did a marvelous job. The Vice President came, the President of the Senate, the head of our Senate family. Senator BYRON DORGAN was there. Senator CHUCK ROBB was there. Senator GREGG was there. Former Senator Robert Dole was there. And there was a host of friends. The church was filled. The balcony was filled. It was a great outpouring of generous tribute and love for Scott Bates. 
   Although I had known Scott for 30 years, I had never known him as I came to know him last Saturday afternoon when I heard Lisa and Lori and Paul speak of their father. Then and only then did I realize what a truly great family this was. Only then did I realize what a father's love could be for his two daughters and his son. And only then did I realize what a deep and abiding and living love Scott's children had for him. His wife Ricki was there. She had been brought in, and she lay there  on a cot, she having not yet recovered from the injuries she sustained when the accident occurred. 
   It was evident that this was a family in which there was real love and in which the presence of God made itself manifest, because this was not something that just came about overnight. I will never forget the sight of those children speaking about their father and their mother and then seeing them, after they had spoken to the audience, go to their mother and kiss her on the cheek. Scott must have been pleased with it all. 
   I count it as a great honor to have been invited by Scott's family to speak during that hour. To Lisa and Lori and Paul, I think your father would want me to say to you, live as he taught you to live and strive always to make him proud. He knows. 
   To his legion of friends, I say that Scott's life was a blessing, a blessing to each of us who knew him. May we strive to be like him that we may be more worthy for, indeed, here was a man. When comes such another? 
   To his wife Ricki, Erma and I say, the love of your children and your friends and the mercies of an omnipotent God can, over the passage of time, be an anodyne to your grief. Be assured, Ricki, love is timeless, love is endless and Scott will be with you always. 
   And sometimes in the quietness of an evening or in the clear silence, as you gaze upon the lustre of the Morning Star, you may hear someone whisper: 
 If I should ever leave you whom I love To go along the silent way, grieve not Nor speak of me with tears, But laugh and talk of me As if I were beside you, for who knows But that I shall be, oftentime? 
 I'd come, I'd come, could I but find a way, But would not tears and grief be barriers? 
 And when you hear a song I used to sing Or see a bird I love, Let not the thought of me be sad, For I am loving you, just as I always have. 
 You were so good to me, So many things I wanted still to do, So many, many things to say to you. 
 Remember that I did not fear, It was just leaving you, I could not bear to face; We cannot see Beyond . . . But this I know: I loved you so. `Twas Heaven here with you.  
   Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his comments. They are timely and they are very persuasive to me. I join with him in expressing hope that we will apply these surpluses to reducing the national debt--after, of course, shoring up Social Security. And we have to think of Medicare, also. 
   I have been in politics now 53 years. The easiest vote that I ever cast was a vote to cut taxes. It didn't require any courage on my part. And likewise, one of the most difficult votes is a vote to increase taxes. We have to do that from time to time. 
   Now, if Congress passes legislation to provide for tax cuts --and there may be some areas of tax cuts that I can very well support--but generally speaking, if we do, of course, the legislation that Congress enacts to do that would be permanent legislation, will it not, until changed? So if after a while--not 10 years hence, as the distinguished Senator has shown on his graph, but 5 years hence, or 4 years hence, 3 years hence--we hit upon hard times, then what? Would the reduced taxes continue, unless Congress legislated to increase them again? Would they, may I ask the Senator?

   Mr. BYRD. Then it would be incumbent upon us to make difficult decisions and act to increase the revenue again. 
   Well, I join with the Senator. I think he performs a great service in calling to our attention and to the attention of the American people the options we face. I hope that Congress will think long and carefully about what we do. We are in a happy situation, but who knows how long the situation will remain happy. I see Alan Greenspan down in that engine room, and he is entitled to a good many compliments from all of us for the good work that he has done, the vision that he has displayed. But I join with the Senator and I hope he will help to lead us as we move forward in the coming days and use his good economics. I think I had about one semester of economics when I was in high school, and that is about it. But the Senator from North Dakota has had excellent training, a fine education in that field. I am going to continue to listen to him and look to him for leadership as we go forward. I thank him very much.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. Chief Justice: 
 I think my country sinks beneath the yoke, It weeps, it bleeds, And each new day, a gash is added to her wounds.  
   I am the only remaining Member of Congress who was here in 1954 when we added the words ``under God'' to the Pledge of Allegiance. That was on June 7, 1954. One year from that day we added the words ``In God We Trust'' to the currency and coin of this country. Those words were already on some of the coins. But I shall always be proud to have voted to add those words, ``under God'' and ``In God We Trust.'' They mean much to us today as we meet here. 
   This is my 47th year in Congress. I never dreamed that this day would ever come. And, until 6 months ago I couldn't place myself in this position. I couldn't imagine that, really, an American President was about to be impeached.  
   A few years ago, when my youngest grandson, who now is a Ph.D. in physics, was just a little tot, he came up to my den and looked around and said, ``Papa, who made this mess?'' 
   Now, Senators, who made this mess? The mess was created at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. The House of Representatives didn't make it. The U.S. Senate didn't make it. But, nevertheless, we sit here today in judgment of a President. 
   Mr. Chief Justice, I thank you for presiding over this gathering with such grace and dignity. But the Chief Justice is not here because he wanted to be. He is not here because we asked him to come. He is here because the Constitution commanded that he be here. Senators are not here because you wanted to be here today. 
   We are here because the Constitution said that the Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments. 
   Soon we will vote and, hopefully, end this nightmarish time for the nation. Like so many Americans, I have been deeply torn on the matter of impeachment. I have been angry at the President, sickened that his behavior has hurt us all and led to this spectacle. I am sad for all of the actors in this national tragedy. His family and even the loyal people around him whom he betrayed--all have been hurt. All of the institutions of government--the presidency, the House of Representatives, the Senate, the system of justice and law, yes, even the media--all have been damaged by this unhappy and sorry chapter in our nation's history. 
   The events of this last year have engendered so much disillusionment, distrust, bitter division and discord among the people of the United States. There can be, I fear, no happy ending, no final act that leads to a curtain call in which all the actors link hands and bow together amid great applause from the audience. No matter what happens here, many, many people will be left tasting only the bitter dregs of discontent. 
   I was proud of this Senate when, early last month, we gathered in the Old Senate Chamber to choose a path on which to proceed. We agreed on a Constitutional road map to follow during the early days of this trial. We followed that road map to the letter, considering a motion to dismiss the proceedings as well as one to provide for the deposition of witnesses. When there was a question or conflict, we decided the answer together. I commend Senator DASCHLE and Senator LOTT for their untiring efforts to maintain bipartisanship. 
   Hamilton observed that impeachable offenses ``are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust . . . to injuries done immediately to the society itself.'' Hamilton also observed that the impeachment court could not be ``tied down'' by strict rules, ``either in the delineation of the offense by the prosecutors (the House of Representatives) or in the construction of it by the judges (the Senate).'' 
   Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story said: ``The jurisdiction is to be exercised over offenses, which are committed by public men in violation of their public trust and duties ..... injuries to the society in its political character,'' . . . ``such kind of misdeeds . . . as peculiarly injure the commonwealth by the abuse of high offices of trust.'' 
   Story observed that ``no previous statute is necessary to authorize an impeachment for any official misconduct,'' . . . because ``political offenses are so various and complex . . . so utterly incapable of being defined, or classified, that the task of positive legislation would be impracticable, if it were not almost absurd to attempt it.'' 
   There are those--without my repeating the sordid details of what we have all heard over and over and over again--there are those who say that the President lied to protect his family. We all understand that. I have a feeling for that. But I can never forget his standing before the television cameras and saying to the American people, what he said: ``Now I want you to listen to me.....'' Don't you Senators think that that was a bit overdone if the purpose was to protect his family? 
   ``O, what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.'' 
   Impeachment is a sword of Damocles that hangs over the heads of presidents, vice presidents, and all civil officers, always ready to drop should it become necessary. But, the impeachment of a President is uniquely and especially grave. We must recognize the gravity and awesomeness of it, and act in accordance with the oath we took to do ``impartial justice''. We are the wielders of this weapon, responsible for using it sparingly and with prudence and wisdom. 
   This is only the second time that this nation has ever impeached a President. President Nixon resigned when it was made clear to him that, if impeached and tried, he would be convicted and removed from office. In that instance, both the country and the Congress were of the same mind that the President's offenses merited his removal. It was not a partisan political impeachment; it was a bipartisan act. But where political partisanship becomes such an overwhelming factor as to put the country and the Congress at odds, as it has with this impeachment, something draws us back. We must be careful of the precedent we set. One political party, alone, should not be enough to bring Goliath's great sword out of the Temple. 
   Regrettably, this process has become so partisan on both sides of the aisle and particularly in the House and was so tainted from the outset, that the American people have rebelled against it. The President lied to the American people, and, while a great majority of the people believe, as I do, that the President made false and misleading statements under oath, still, some two-thirds of the American people do not want the President removed from office. I do not think that this is just a reflection of the American people's traditional bias for the underdog, but rather, of the much more basic American dislike of unfairness. Many people, perhaps even most people, do not believe that this process has been a fair process. They are further supported in their viewpoint by the polarization and partisanship so regrettably displayed in Congress. 
   Indeed, the atmosphere in Washington has become poisoned by politics and even by personal vendettas. As a result, perspective and a clear sense of proportion and balance have been lost by all too many people. As a byproduct of the venom, a process intended to be serious and sober has, instead, devolved into a virulent, off-color soap opera event, watched by an incredulous people grown weary of its content. 
   We have known for weeks that the votes were not here to convict this President. And yet some wanted to press on, in a desperate attempt to bring witnesses onto the Senate Floor. What a dreadful national spectacle that would have been! That is one reason why I offered a motion to dismiss the proceedings. Both the House Managers and the White House defense team had presented their case and had presented it well. We had gotten into the 16 hours of questioning by Senators, while all went along swimmingly for a while, the proceedings began to degenerate into a dueling press conference on both sides of the aisle. Moreover, the House Managers had already taken steps to begin the deposition of Monica Lewinsky, and the fact that they were doing this before the Senate had even voted to depose witnesses, led me to believe that it was time to call the whole thing off before the Senate slipped into the snake pit of bitter partisanship like the House of Representatives had done. Always with a weather eye open concerning the image of the Senate and its place in history, I made the motion to dismiss which had been provided for in the original agreement by 100 Senators on January 8, following the great bipartisan meeting we had all attended in the old Senate Chamber. Many people all around the country, as well as here within the beltway, misunderstood my reasons for moving to dismiss. I didn't do that to protect Mr. Clinton, as some people have so mistakenly surmised. I knew that the votes were not here then to convict him, and we all know they are not here now. I just didn't want the Senate to sink further into the mire. I did not want this body to damage its own quotient of public trust the way the House and the White House have diminished theirs. 
   I called for these proceedings to be dismissed, out of genuine concern for the divisive effect that an ultimately futile trial would have on the Senate and on the nation.  
   The House Articles charged the President with having committed perjury. This word ``perjury''--lawyers can dance all around the head of a pin on that word. I won't attempt to dance all around on the head of the pin on the word ``perjury.'' The President plainly lied to the American people. Of course, that is not impeachable, but he also lied under oath in judicial proceedings. 
   Mr. Clinton's offenses do, in my judgment, constitute an ``abuse or violation of some public trust.'' Reasonable men and women can, of course, differ with my viewpoint. Even though the House of Representatives rejected the second article that came out of the Judiciary Committee, the evidence against Mr. Clinton shows that he willfully and knowingly and repeatedly gave false testimony under oath in judicial proceedings. 
   When the President of the United States, who has sworn to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and to see to it that the laws be faithfully executed, breaks the law himself by lying under oath, he undermines the system of justice and law on which this Republic--not this ``democracy''--this Republic has its foundation. 
   In so doing, has the President not committed an offense in violation of the public trust? Does not this misconduct constitute an injury to the society and its political character? Does not such injury to the institutions of Government constitute an impeachable offense, a political high crime or high misdemeanor against the state? How would Washington vote? How would Hamilton vote? How would Madison or Mason or Gerry vote? My head and my heart tell me that their answer to these questions would be, ``Yes.'' 
   But the matter does not end there. The Constitution states, without equivocation, that the President, Vice President or any civil officer, when impeached and convicted, shall be removed from office. Hence, one cannot convict the President without removing him from office. 
   Should Mr. Clinton be removed from office for these impeachable offenses? This question gives me great pause. The answer is, as it was intended to be by the framers, a difficult calculus. This is without question the most difficult, wrenching and soul-searching vote that I have ever, ever cast in my 46 years in Congress. A vote to convict carries with it an automatic removal of the President from office. It is not a two-step process. Senators can't vote maybe. The only vote that the Senator can cast, under the rules, as written, is a vote either to convict and remove or a vote to acquit. 
   So should I vote ``Guilty'' when my name is called, believing that President Clinton's offenses constitute high misdemeanors? 
   Should I vote guilty and vote to remove him from office? Some critics may say--some of my colleagues may say--they may ask, if you believe he is guilty, how can you not vote to remove him from office? 
   There is some logic to the question, but simple logic can point one way while wisdom may be in quite a different direction. It is not a popularity contest, of course. But remember our English forbears, who, on June 20, 1604, submitted to King James I the Apology of the Commons, in which they declared that their rights were not derived from kings, and that, ``The voice of the people in things of their knowledge is [as] the voice of God.'' ``Vox populi, vox Dei.'' 
   The American people deeply believe in fairness, and they have come to view the President as having ``been put upon'' for politically partisan reasons. They think that the House proceedings were unfair. History, too, will see it that way. The people believe that the Independent Counsel, Mr. Starr, had motivations which went beyond the duties strictly assigned to him. 
   In the end, the people's perception of this entire matter as being driven by political agendas all around, and the resulting lack of support for the President's removal, tip the scales for allowing this President to serve out the remaining 22 months of his term, as he was elected to do. When the people believe that we who have been entrusted with their proxies, have been motivated mostly or solely by political partisanship on a matter of such momentous import as the removal from office of a twice-elected President, wisdom dictates that we turn away from that dramatic step. To drop the sword of Damocles now, given the bitter political partisanship surrounding this entire matter, would only serve to further undermine a public trust that is too much damaged already. Therefore, I will reluctantly vote to acquit. 
   In 399 B.C., Socrates was convicted and sentenced by the Athenian jury to die. If only 30 votes on that Athenian jury had switched, Socrates would not have been convicted. If only twenty Senators--or less--on my side of the aisle who are expected to acquit, were to switch their votes, President Clinton would be convicted, and before this coming Sabbath day, he would be removed from the Oval Office. President Clinton will be acquitted by the Senate; yet, he will not be vindicated. 
   The crowds will still cheer the President of the United States, but the American people have been deeply hurt and, while they may forgive, they will not forget. The pages of history will not be expunged--ever! 
   Be assured that there will be no winners on this vote. The vote cast by every Senator will be criticized harshly by various individuals and sundry interest groups. Yet, it is well for the critics to remember that each Senator has not only taken a solemn oath to support and defend the Constitution, but also to do ``impartial justice'' to Mr. Clinton and to the nation, ``So help me, God''. The critics and the cynics have not taken that oath; only Senators have done so. Carrying out that oath has not been easy. That oath does not say anything about political party; politics should have nothing to do with it. 
   The frenzy of pro-and-con opinions on every aspect of this case emanating from every conceivable source in the land has made coming to any sort of ``impartial'' conclusion akin to performing brain surgery in a noisy, rowdy football stadium. It will be easy for the cynics and the critics who do not have to vote, to stand on the sidelines and berate us. But only those of us who have to cast the votes will bear the judgment of history. 
   Mr. Chief Justice, none of us knows whether the attitudes of the American people will take a different turn after this trial is over and this drab chapter is closed. ``Fame is a vapor; popularity an accident; riches take wings; those who cheer today may curse tomorrow; only one thing endures--character!'' It is the character of the Senate that will count. And while the politics of destruction may be satisfying to some, the rubble of political ruin provides a dangerous and unstable foundation for the nation. 
   And yet we must move ahead. The nation is faced with potential dangers abroad. No one can foresee what will happen in Russia or in North Korea or in Kosovo or in Iraq. To remove Mr. Clinton at this time could create an unstable condition for our nation in the face of unforeseen and potentially dangerous happenings overseas. 
   Preceding Senators have sounded the clarion note of separation of powers! I have sounded that same trumpet many times when the line item veto was before the Senate, but to no avail. Some of the voices that have rung throughout this chamber in these deliberations, were curiously still on that occasion. The Supreme Court of the United States saved the Constitution and struck that law down. But the Supreme Court has no voice in the decision that confronts the Senate at this hour. It is for the Senate alone to make. When these Senate doors are flung open, we must hope that the vote that follows will strengthen, not weaken, our nation. 
   Let there be no preening and posturing and gloating on the White House lawn this time when the voting is over and done. The House of Representatives has already inflicted upon the President the greatest censure, the greatest condemnation, that the House can inflict upon any President. And it is called impeachment! That was an indelible judgment which can never be withdrawn. It will run throughout the pages of history and its deep stain can never be eradicated from the eyes and memories of man. God can forgive us all, but history may not. 
   Within a few hours, the mechanics of this matter will finally be concluded. But it will not yet be over. For the nation must still digest the unpleasant residue of these events. Mr. Chief Justice, hatred is an ugly thing. It can seize the psyche and twist sound reasoning. I have seen it unleashed in all  its mindless fury too many times in my own life. In a charged political atmosphere, it can destroy all in its path with the blind fury of a whirlwind. I hear its ominous rumble and see its destructive funnel on the horizon in our land today. I fear for our nation if its turbulent winds are not calmed and its storm clouds somehow dispersed. In the days to come, we must do all that we can to stop the feeding of its vengeful fires. Let us heap no more coals to fan the flames. Public passion has been aroused to a fever pitch, and we as leaders must come together to heal the open wounds, bind up the damaged trust, and, by our example, again unite our people. We would all be wise to cool the rhetoric. 
   For the common good, we must now put aside the bitterness that has infected our nation, and take up a new mantle. We have to work with this President and with each other, and with the members of the House of Representatives in dealing with the many pressing issues which face the nation. We must, each of us, resolve through our efforts to rebuild the lost confidence in our government institutions. We can begin by putting behind us the distrust and bitterness caused by this sorry episode, and search for common ground instead of shoring up the divisions that have eroded decency and good will and dimmed our collective vision. We must seek out our better natures and aspire to higher things. I hope that with the end of these proceedings, we can, together, crush the seeds of ugliness and enmity which have taken root in the sacred soil of our republic, and, instead, sow new respect for honestly differing views, bipartisanship, and simple kindness towards each other. We have much important work to do. And, in truth, it is long past time for us to move on.

   Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor with Senator THURMOND a resolution commending Mr. Frank Burk who retired as Legislative Counsel of the Senate on December 31, 1998. While serving as President pro tempore of the Senate, I had the pleasure of appointing Frank Burk to the position of Legislative Counsel of the Senate on January 1, 1991. 
   I wish to join with Senator THURMOND, and with all Senators, in expressing our deepest gratitude to Frank Burk for his long years of service to the United States Senate. He has been part of the Office of Legislative Counsel for more than 28 years, including the last 8 as Legislative Counsel; and during that time he has provided valuable assistance to me and to my staff. 
   Mr. President, while overseeing the Office of Legislative Counsel during the first 4 years of Frank Burk's tenure as Legislative Counsel, I appreciated the great dedication and professionalism he displayed in carrying out his duties and responsibilities. I know that his departure will leave a void that is difficult to fill. In passing this resolution, the Senate recognizes his years of commitment to the Senate. 
   Mr. President, I wish Frank Burk and his family well in his retirement.
