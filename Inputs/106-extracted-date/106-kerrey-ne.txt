   Mr. KERREY. There are an awful lot of people wondering where is the chairman of the Finance Committee, the ranking member of the Finance Committee. We are going to be taking up a tax bill and a Medicare/Medicaid bill. Why don't we see Chairman ROTH and ranking member MOYNIHAN down here managing this bill? Why is it a Small Business Committee that has the responsibility for a piece of legislation dealing with targeted tax credits and Medicare relief?

   Mr. KERREY. This is a Small Business piece of legislation. This bill references small business. This is not a Finance Committee bill. The answer is, it is not a Finance Committee bill. 
   Didn't the majority do the legislative equivalent of stealth molasses here? Didn't they take another piece of legislation, hollow it out, and stuff in it targeted tax cuts that their Presidential candidate has been opposing for the last 90 days, criticizing the Vice President, saying Washington, DC, should not decide, we should not be deciding in Washington, DC, who gets a tax cut? That is what I have been hearing over and over. 
   I ask my friend from Massachusetts, first of all, is it correct that they stuffed a tax bill and they have stuffed a health care bill inside of some other bill that they hollowed out, that has not gone through the normal process, and that the tax provision itself seems to violate what their Presidential candidate wants to do? Basically, it seems to me what our friends on the other side of the aisle are saying is Vice President GORE is right; Governor Bush is wrong.

   Mr. KERREY. One of the Presidential debates was in Massachusetts. I know the distinguished Senator attended it. I suspect he watched the other Presidential debates. One of the most important dividing lines between the two candidates is that the Governor from Texas has been saying Washington, DC should not decide who gets a tax cut and who does not. The Vice President has been saying--not only for fiscal reasons but also for reasons of fairness--that is precisely what we should do. We should decide who is going to get a tax cut and target those tax cuts rather than having across-the-board tax cuts predominantly for the wealthiest Americans. 
   It seems to me what the Republican leadership in the House and the Senate are saying that the Vice President is right; we should target taxes and tax cuts. I wonder if the Senator from Massachusetts sees it that way.

   Mr. KERREY. Essentially, the argument is over. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are agreeing with us; their Presidential candidate is wrong; we should target tax cuts. 
   Then you move on to the next question, which is, Who is going to get the tax cut? What standards do we apply to make that decision? Would the Senator from Massachusetts agree that it seems one of the missing questions that was not asked was--it doesn't seem to me it was asked. None of our colleagues from the other side of the aisle are here. I look forward to asking them. I don't know who was in the room when this was written. But whoever was in the room from the other side of the aisle, there were no Democrats there. Does it appear to the Senator that anybody in that room asked the question: Is this fair, given the needs of this country? Is this package fair? Did they seem to apply a standard or a test of fairness as they made their decision?

   Mr. KERREY. And then I will wait to speak further after the Senator finishes his opening remarks. 
   In this morning's New York Times, there is an article describing the Texas Governor's speech in Pennsylvania yesterday. He does know how to turn a phrase. It is very good language. But I wonder if the Senator from Massachusetts sees a conflict in what the Governor of Texas is saying that he wants to do and what is in this bill. 
   Let me read what he said:  
   In my administration, we will ask not only what is legal but also what is right, not just what the lawyers allow but what the public deserves.  
   He went on and said:  
   In my administration, we will make it clear there is the controlling legal authority of conscience.  
   Does my friend from Massachusetts think this process and this proposal meets the test that the Governor of Texas set yesterday in Pennsylvania?

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, in yesterday's New York Times, there was a story about a young man in Poughkeepsie, NY, who used a global positioning satellite device--a little, hand-held device that tells you exactly where you are--to do something that apparently is sweeping the country; that is, to cachet something and then put a GPS label on it. Then somebody else goes out and tries to find it. It is the latest fad in the never-ending pursuit of ways to use sophisticated technologies to accomplish useless things. 
   With great respect to the Senator from Idaho, what we have here is one more attempt to come down here and use sophisticated descriptions of the Vice President to accomplish useless things.  
   The other day, the Senator from Nevada came down and read I don't know how many pages of statements of the Governor of Texas; things that he said were incorrect. ``Nigeria is a continent''--things like that--and, ``I am the only candidate who knows how to put food on my family.'' 
   It is funny. 
   The truth is, the Vice President, in the House of Representatives, did play an instrumental role in providing the funding for the National Science Foundation, DARPA, and other sorts of things. One of the founders of Netscape the other day said Netscape wouldn't have been created--he is the guy that wrote the software at Champaign-Urbana, IL, called Mosaic that lead to the creation of the Internet. 
   He said: I wouldn't have gotten my start, and we wouldn't have been doing our work were it not for AL GORE'S work over in the House. 
   All of these things we can argue. 
   I have been asked repeatedly: Do you think the Governor of Texas is competent enough to be President? Does he lack intelligence? 
   I was asked the other day on a radio show. I don't say that the Governor of Texas lacks intelligence; I do not suggest that he is incompetent; But I think it is important to examine the proposals that are on the table. The Governor of Texas says we ought to cut income taxes by $1.6 trillion. He says let the American people decide how the money is going to be spent. 
   That is a reasonable thing to do. I don't object to letting the American people decide how they are going to spend their own money. 
   Over the last 10 years, we have made great strides, starting with a piece of legislation that the father of the Governor of Texas supported in 1990. George Herbert Walker Bush, when he was campaigning in 1980 for the Republican nomination, described Ronald Reagan's proposals as ``voodoo economics.'' He went along with him as Vice President for 8 years, and for 2 years as President. 
   In 1990, he said we have had enough. He signed legislation and imposed caps that we are obliterating this year. 
   We are ignoring the caps this year. I think we are going to be $300 billion over on appropriations; the tax bill, another $250 billion against Medicare; health provisions, another $250 billion. We are about $900 billion over the caps. 
   But the Governor of Texas is determined to do another $1.6 trillion on top of that--$1.1 trillion of payroll tax; ``voodoo economics,'' and will put at risk not just this surplus that we have but the jobs that have been created as a consequence of what his father started in 1990. 
   That is what this campaign is about. It should not be in 
   pursuit of what I consider to be sort of useless arguments where you find that the Vice President said something that isn't 100 percent true. So he finds something that the Governor of Texas says isn't 100 percent true. That really makes unusual candidates for office. It is a fairly common thing for us to do in the campaign. 
   But, in my view, an awful lot is at stake here--an awful lot more than just trying to figure out who says the silliest things and the most preposterous things. 
   The economic strategy of these two individuals is dramatically different. Their approach to problem solving is also dramatically different, and their attitudes toward many issues are dramatically different. We ought to allow the American people to distinguish one from the other. 
   I for one am getting sort of weary from all of these attempts to demonstrate that one person lies and the other person is so stupid that they can't figure out one thing from another. 
   It is far more important, it seems to me, for the American people to assess where it is these two individuals want to take this country, and then try to, as well, give them the opportunity to separate themselves. And they are clearly dramatically different in their approach not only to the issues but in their approach to the economy and in their approach to where they want to take the United States of America. 
   I yield the floor and look forward to the comments of the distinguished Senator from Utah.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, my good friend from Utah just described two things that I see much differently than he does. The conflict we are having right now over Commerce-State-Justice is occurring as a consequence of the House and the Senate not finishing their appropriations work. They are supposed to be done by the first of October. We are supposed to have all 13 bills passed. Our work is supposed to be done and all the bills sent to the President for signature. We were not able to get the work done. We are not able to look much further than what has happened to fiscal discipline around here to discover why we have been unable to get our appropriations bills done, why there have been delays on the appropriations bills. The answer is we are spending a lot more than the budget caps allow. 
   According to Bill Hoagland, who in the New York Times lays it out as accurately as anybody--I consider him to be an extremely reliable analyzer of the numbers--the appropriations bills we are going to pass will be $310 billion over the caps as estimated by CBO over the next 10 years, and that presumes that only inflation will be allowed over the next 10 years in growth in appropriations which we did not do this year. We are way beyond inflation this year. It is probably not $310 billion. It is probably much more than that. That is the problem. 
   It is very much a case where we had a glass slipper that was too small for our great big foot, and we could not get all the things we wanted to spend into that shoe. The Republican majority, facing that problem, had to decide what it was going to do. It has delayed, delayed, delayed, and as a consequence, we are now in a situation where, if we attach anything to it that is objectionable to the President, it is going to provoke a veto. 
   You know what you have to do to get the President to sign it. He will tell you what to do to sign it. If you are 27 days late, do not be surprised if you have lost leverage. Of course you have lost leverage; you are 27 days beyond the battle line, what the law tells us we are supposed to be doing with our appropriations bills. 
   There are two things I want to talk about as we head toward the end of this session that I find to be very troubling. The first is what we are doing with the surplus itself. Again, the second thing the Senator from Utah said earlier is we balanced the budget in 1997 and that it came about as a result of the election of a Republican House and Senate in 1995. 
   I voted for a Republican budget in 1995. I voted for a Republican budget in 1997 in order to balance it. But we began down this trail in 1990. That is when the budget caps were enacted. That is when we established sequestration to put in automatic across-the-board cuts if we were unable to get our budget inside the caps. There was a purpose. Balancing the budget was not an end in itself; it was a means to an end. 
   What was the end? The end was growth in the economy. We believed that if you balanced the budget--in other words, if you spent less than you taxed--that that would produce growth in the economy. That was the argument, not just in 1990, but way long before that. 
   I recall, when I was Governor, signing a letter in support of what the Republican Senate was doing in 1985 to try to balance the budget. It included a freezing of the COLA, which some say contributed to the loss of the Republican Senate in the 1986 election. I do not know if that is true or not. It was tough medicine. It would have balanced the budget. It is not easy to balance the budget. 
   I remember voting in 1990, 1993, and 1997--and the criticism is always the same: I want to balance the budget. I believe deficit reduction is important. I just don't want to pay any more or take any less. The only objection is, you cut my program and increased my taxes. Other than that, I liked what you did. 
   We had tough medicine in 1990, tough medicine in 1993, and tough medicine in 1997. All during those years, we had a means to say to our citizens: Look, I have to say no; I have a spending cap up until this year. If you came to this floor, and there was a motion to waive the Budget Act, it was tough to get 60 votes. Not anymore. Today, it is relatively easy to get 60 votes. I am not even sure we are going to have a vote to break the budget caps on appropriations. 
   Listen to what Mr. Hoagland says: This year we started off with a $2.4 trillion general fund surplus. The appropriations is going to reduce that surplus by $310 billion. An additional $295 billion in surplus goes for two tax cuts: the $240 billion package we are battling over right now and a separate $55 billion reduction in taxes on long distance telephone calls. 
   I listened to the argument. This is a Spanish-American War tax. For gosh sakes, the income tax is a World War I tax. Let's get rid of that, too, if that is the basis of why eliminating a tax makes good sense. 
   But we are going to eliminate a $55 billion tax. We are going to increase payments to Medicare. That is $74 billion more in the surplus, another $44 billion going to increased pension benefits to military retirees. Tax cuts and spending increases come to $723 billion over 10 years. The surplus is actually reduced by an additional $187 billion because of interest costs, bringing the total to $910 billion. 
   Since the 1990 Budget Act, signed by President Bush--all through the 1990s--we had to come to the floor, and if you wanted to offer something that spent more money, you had to have an offset. It was called the pay-go system. 
   We discovered that tucked in this little $247 billion tax bill that we are arguing about is a provision that waives the pay-go provisions. I mean, we are abandoning everything that got us to where we are today. 
   Again, I emphasize to people who want to know, what is this all about? Twenty-one million dollars have been created. The 
   recovery, in my view, started prior to 1993. It started in 1991 and 1992. The deficit started coming down in 1992, and in no small part because of what we did in 1990. The full story did not begin in 1997. It did not start in 1993. It started in 1990. And now we are just throwing it all out the window, saying: It does not matter anymore; we have a great big surplus. That is why the American people are distrustful. That is why they are saying to us: Take that surplus and pay down the debt. That is why they are not supporting big tax cuts. 
   I voted for the Republican tax cut the first time it came up. Then I went home and the people of Nebraska said to me: We don't want it. We don't want it. Pay down the debt. 
   This fiscal discipline has been good for us. It has created jobs. It has promoted economic growth. There has been a positive result. 
   So I say, especially with the Governor of Texas saying he is committed to a $1.6 trillion income tax cut and a $1.1 trillion payroll tax cut, that on top of what we have already done, in my view, that is unquestionably going to put us right back in the soup. That is the failed policy of the past. 
   The failed policy of the past is when we said it doesn't matter if our budget is balanced. The failed policy of the past is when we were taking 22 percent of our income and spending it with 18-percent taxes coming in. Now it is the opposite. Spending levels are at 18 percent--the lowest level they have been since the middle of the 1970s, before this year, before what we have been doing in the past week or so--heading to 16 percent. It has not been at that level since Dwight Eisenhower was President.  
   I have to say that given what Congress is doing, and what we are seeing at the Presidential debate level, my hope is the American people will wise up and say: We got to where we are with tough choices. We are about ready to throw it all down the drain. 
   My belief is that fiscal discipline has not just been good for us here domestically, it has given us the strength to do an awful lot of things throughout the world as well. That is our greatest source of strength, our capacity to keep our economy growing. 
   You do not have to look any further than the former Soviet Union and Russia. They have a GDP that is $30 billion less than we have for defense. I am not saying our defense ought to be lower. I support taking it higher. I do not compare our defense against Russia, but their GDP is so low they cannot take care of submarines such as the Kursk. 
   I took a trip to Africa. Of the 11 nations we visited, they spend less than $10 per person on health care and $10 per person on education. The reason is their income is insufficient. They do not have the growth and are not producing things that the world wants to buy, and the United States of America does. 
   So I do not want to go back to the failed policies of the past. I do not want to go back to ``voodoo economics.'' I do not want to go back to those days when we said to the American people that it does not matter whether or not our budget is balanced. 
   We paid too big a price to get to where we are today. The American people not only are more prosperous and more enthusiastic about their economy and their future, but they have an awful lot more confidence in democracy as a result of our 
   finally being able to do something about what was public enemy No. 1, all the way through the 1980s, and all the way through the 1990s. 
   I am sure former President Bush remembers what happened in 1992. He had a guy by the name of Ross Perot who made the deficit a battle cry and enabled him to have an impact upon that Presidential election, and probably enabled then-Governor Clinton to win that election, with 43 percent of the vote. 
   So you do not have to go back very far to see why it is that we have to reestablish fiscal discipline. We are going in the wrong direction. To get rid of the pay-go provisions is reason enough to vote against this tax bill for anybody who went all the way through the 1990s in this Congress. And that is the reason we are struggling with Commerce-State-Justice. 
   The dirty little secret is that our spending appetite exceeds the budget caps that got us to where we are today. As I said, this sounds like all process arguments. But there was a big payoff in eliminating that deficit, paying down the public debt, and relieving the pressure upon the private sector of borrowing, as we have done. 
   It did not just enable the economy to grow, it lowered the cost of borrowing money for a house, lowered the cost of borrowing money for an automobile, and lowered the cost of borrowing money for a business. In my view, at least as one former businessperson, it promoted an awful lot of economic growth. It has a huge impact on our capacity to create the kind of jobs that the American people want. 
   There is a second troubling thing that I have heard said over and over during this tax debate and the debate on the Medicare balanced budget give-backs as well. Those are both provisions we have, recognizing in 1997 we took almost $300 billion out of Medicare for providers instead of the $100 billion that we thought. So we are trying to adjust that a bit and make things a little easier for--in my State, especially the rural providers--the providers, but also home health care people and long-term care providers, and so forth, that are in that package. 
   I have heard it said over and over that, gee, this was largely bipartisan. Many of the provisions in this bill are provisions that were supported by Democrats. That is absolutely true. There are many provisions that are in this bill that were supported by Democrats. That is not the issue. The problem is, I heard one of my colleagues say earlier--he was describing negotiations with China--an agreement is just a temporary interruption in the negotiations. 
   We had an agreement on pensions. We had an agreement on pension reforms. Democrats came on board saying: We recognize that in order to do pension reform, you are going to have to provide changes in the law that are likely to benefit upper income people. 
   The distinguished Senator from Utah earlier talked about the 1 percent. He is absolutely right. 
   Almost 40 percent of the swing in the deficit from 1992 to today, 43 percent, an estimate made by Bill Hoagland of the New York Times--43 percent of that came because income tax rates were higher, and we had a big run-up in the stock market, a big cashing out of stock options, and a big cashing out of pensions as well. So upper income people are paying more taxes, especially Americans who have more than $1 million of taxable income. They are paying a lot of taxes. 
   So Democrats--I for one--acknowledge that if you are going to do a pension reform bill, it is likely to benefit upper income people. We are not going to demagogue that. It is likely to be that that is the case. But we asked for a couple little provisions to help that low- and moderate-income worker. They were tax credits. 
   The chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. ARCHER, doesn't like tax credits. So he stripped the two provisions out that we had in there for small businesses to help them defray the cost of start-up pensions. He stripped the provision out that had a matching in there for this low- and moderate-income worker who is working for small businesses that have fewer than 100 employees. He stripped that out because he doesn't like tax credits. We had a deal. So when the Republican leadership got together, they yielded to Mr. ARCHER and stripped out provisions of the pension bill we wanted that made it more fair. 
   I said last night, God created Democrats so we can ask the question: Is it fair? Sometimes we don't ask: Can we pay for it? That is something we have to train ourselves to do, and I thought we had through the 1990s with the budget caps. I talked about that earlier. But we asked the question: Is it fair? If we are going to spend money and try to increase the amount of pension coverage we have in the United States of America, shouldn't we try to do it for low- and moderate-income working people in the workforce with employers who have fewer than 100 employees? Shouldn't we do that? We answered yes. And Republicans in the Finance Committee agreed with us. That is what we got. 
   Mr. ARCHER said he doesn't like tax credits. So when the Republican leadership all got together--without a hearing--they stripped it out. Guess what. With it stripped out, Mr. ARCHER still votes against it. 
   So they took something out of the pension bill they now want us to pass, that we had insisted on in order to get Mr. ARCHER's support, and he still votes against the darn thing. 
   That is why we are pushing back. That is why we urge President Clinton to veto this thing. We would like to get most of the things that are in this tax bill. We believe Vice President GORE is correct when he says we ought to make careful decisions and selections about whose taxes are going to get cut. That is what we ought to attempt to do. We ought to target those tax cuts. 
   But you have to target the tax cuts, especially when you are dealing with pensions and health care, as much of this does, you ought to target it so as to increase the number of people who have pensions. 
   All of us here in Congress aren't going to have any difficulty contributing to get another $5,000. We have plenty of disposable income to come up with the money to be able to increase our contributions. The problem is for that minimum-wage, or slightly over, individual in a small business who is struggling to get it done. 
   The same on health insurance: If you are trying to increase the number of people who have health insurance, you have to do more than what is in this tax package. My friend from Texas, Senator GRAMM, was talking about the value of the tax deduction. The value of the tax deduction is much greater the higher your income. I get a 40-percent subsidy as a consequence of the level of my income. But if my income is $16,000 a year, I don't get any deduction. If I am paying at the 15-percent  rate, I get a 15-percent deduction. That is how it works. 
   The Joint Tax Committee estimates that 26 million people will get benefits as a consequence of the health care provisions, but only 1.6 million of those people are people who currently don't have health insurance. 
   Republicans in Congress, I think correctly, are saying that what Governor Bush said in the third debate, ``That is the difference between my opponent and I;'' he wants Washington to decide and select who gets a tax cut. Republicans apparently are saying that the Governor is wrong, because we are going to select who gets the tax cuts. 
   If you are going to have a tax cut right now, it seems to me one of the things we ought to try to do is to say: This remarkable recovery we are having right now has been fabulous, but there are some people who have been left behind. Let's try to help them acquire pensions in their part of the American dream. Let's try to help them acquire health insurance in their part of the American dream. We don't do that. 
   As I said, I heard my Republican friends assert several times that Democrats were on board and support many of the provisions. That is true. But we added provisions that were stricken out. We added provisions that would have made the proposal much more fair. I believe you cannot apply a fairness test every single time you are doing things. There are times when life isn't fair. But when you are giving tax cuts to American working families, it seems to me a test of fairness is appropriate. When you are trying to increase the number of people who have pensions in the workforce, when you are trying to increase the number of people who have health insurance, a test of fairness is appropriate for Members of Congress to try to apply to the piece of legislation we are considering. 
   Those are the two objections I have to what is going on right now. The first is, I think we have lost our way when it comes to fiscal discipline, the discipline that enabled us to say to a citizen, when a citizen comes and says, Senator, it only costs $100 million over 10, would you offer an amendment, and I would always say in the 1990s, well, I have to have a ``pay for.'' I have to find an offset. 
   Not anymore. If the pay-go provisions of the Budget Act are repealed, as is proposed in this tax bill, no longer will that be necessary. It used to be I would say: Look, this is going to be tough because it is beyond what we authorized in the Budget Act and to get 60 votes to waive the Budget Act is going to be hard. 
   Not any longer does it appear to be difficult to waive the Budget Act. That discipline that enabled us to get where we are today is at risk in the closing days of the 106th Congress. 
   I hope that in this election the American people will say loud and clear we recognize the value of that fiscal discipline. We benefited from economic growth. We benefited from lower mortgage payments. We benefited from greater opportunity as a 
   consequence of Congress getting its act together, all the way through the 1980s and 1990, 1993, and in 1997. 
   Secondly, I have great objection, as I look at especially the tax cut proposal, but also the BBA give-back proposal, that we simply haven't applied a test of fairness. That is why it was a mistake for Republicans to have a meeting with only Republicans. If you want something to be bipartisan, you have to let Democrats in the room. Likewise, Democrats can't hold a meeting and expect it to be bipartisan if we are the only ones in the room, and then go out and say: Gee, I don't understand why Senator HATCH won't sign on board. It is something he supported years ago. I don't understand why he won't support this. It is similar to something he was talking about. The answer is, he wasn't in the room. He didn't have an opportunity to voice his concern. He didn't have an opportunity to say what he liked or didn't like. 
   What the Republicans did is they brought something that stripped out things we had agreed to, and they did not apply a test of fairness. As a consequence, I am pleased, especially connected to the loss of fiscal discipline, that in the closing days of the 106th the President has indicated he is going to veto these two pieces of legislation. I think the American people will be the beneficiaries of it. 
   My hope is, on both of them, that it will result in bipartisan negotiation and producing something the President can sign. It can be done. We don't have to run out of here over the weekend. We know exactly what to do. It would take us about 30 minutes to put together a tax bill and a BBA give-back bill that would get 80 votes on this floor. We wouldn't have to sit and say, I wonder if the President is going to sign it. We would know he would sign it. If we have 80 votes, he is going to sign it. The last time I checked, that is still enough to override a veto. But we didn't do that. 
   As a result, we are left here on October 27, 27 days beyond the time we were supposed to be done and home, we are left here, still a long way to go before we have an agreement, a long way to go before we will be able to say we have closed up shop and we have finished the people's business. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, continuing what I was talking about earlier, I would like to point out I am not sure all my colleagues understand. But in this tax bill that we are going to take up tomorrow and next week, it has one key provision. Again, this was done with House and Senate leadership getting together and trying to figure out what was put in. It is tucked away at the very end. It is a provision not listed in any summary list by the bill's backers. 
   The provision calls for the abandonment of the pay-as-you-go budget discipline which, since its initial adoption in 1990, has required all tax cuts and spending increases be offset with other tax increases or entitlement spending cuts. This provision would order the Office of Management and Budget to set the PAYGO scorecard to zero instead of reflecting the actual cost of the tax bill in order to avoid a huge sequester the OMB would order, since the cost of the tax bill, if it became law, would come from the projected budget surplus rather than the required offsets. 
   I understand why it is being done. I understand we cannot do it any other way. But that is why we should not do it. All the way through the 1990s when we had this PAYGO provision in there, we were able to maintain our fiscal discipline in spite of great pressure to do the contrary. Whether it was tax cuts or spending increases that were being proposed, we could maintain that discipline because every time we brought an amendment down here to the floor that spent more money or cut somebody's taxes, we had to have an offset. That is the PAYGO provision. And we are going to throw it out the window, it seems to me, and we are going to abandon a principle that has 
   enabled us not just to balance our budget but to help produce the growth in our economy by keeping the pressure off private sector borrowing that we were competing with all the way through the 1980s. 
   We are now paying down debt. I note Government treasuries are becoming of more and more value as they become less and less available, and because people are sensing the economy is growing a bit flat. But there is no pressure. It kept pressure off the Federal Reserve which kept interest rates low, grew our economy, and produced many of the jobs for which we all take credit. So this is a substantial change in the way we have conducted business previously. 
   The second point I want to make, in spite of what the Governor of Texas has been saying about not targeting tax provisions, that is what this bill does. It targets tax provisions. Indeed, of the 119 targeted tax provisions--I note this amends the 1986 Tax Simplification Act. I think it is the twentieth or thirtieth time we have done that since 1986 and the principal sponsor of it, I note with great amusement, is Congressman ARMEY, who is also the No. 1 advocate for tax simplification and the flat tax. But of the 119 targeted tax provisions in this tax bill, only one of the provisions is included in the Bush tax proposal. 
   This is us saying, I think appropriately, that we are going to try to target the taxes. The last thing I would say, I reiterate--I am sure our colleagues have seen and know the numbers in your own State about the number of people who do not have health insurance for all kinds of reasons. 
   Mr. President, 94 percent of the tax benefits in the health insurance category go to subsidize people who already have insurance. Only 6 percent attempts to do what I think America has done at its finest, and that is to try to push the circle of opportunity out further and further. 
   There is no doubt today there is a correlation between lack of health insurance and poor health status. It is most unfortunate that, if we are going to do targeted tax cuts, we do not do those targeted tax cuts in a way that increases our confidence, that as a consequence of what we are doing we will decrease the number of people in our States who currently are out there without any health insurance whatsoever. 
   I yield the floor.

My experience is that all 100 people in this Senate--every single one of them--are trying to do the best job they can. They have different points of views. The Republicans bring certain things to the arguments sometimes that Democrats don't bring, and Democrats bring things that Republicans don't bring from time to time.

   Mr. KERREY. I heard the Governor of Texas say he does not like the Vice President's tax cut proposal because it is targeted. Doesn't it seem that the tax cut proposal that is being brought to us--though it might be hard for my friends on the other side of the aisle to state that they are saying the Vice President is right--is not an across-the-board tax cut, this is a targeted tax cut? Will my friend from Iowa agree they seem to be saying we should have a targeted tax cut?

   Mr. KERREY. Well, their bill does not have across-the-board tax cuts. There has been a debate going on between the Vice President and the Governor of Texas as to whether or not there should be an across-the-board tax cut of $1.6 trillion that the Governor of Texas wants to do, on top of $1.1 trillion of payroll tax cuts, and hundreds of billions of dollars of spending as well. 
   I said the other day, it reminds me of voodoo economics II. I do not think he would be proposing this, which is essentially the failed policies of the past. We tried that once before. President Bush, in 1990, broke from the failed policies of that. 
   I heard the Senator from Arizona earlier talk about the budget caps that were in the 1990 budget agreement. That started us on the road of eliminating our deficits. But he has an across-the-board tax cut. He is criticizing the Vice President for targeting tax cuts, and it seems our friends on the other side of the aisle are saying the Vice President is right, we should have a targeted tax cut. 
   I wonder if my friend from Iowa has also experienced, when you are having discussions, there are some things Democrats bring to the argument, bring to the discussion. I wonder, as I look at this tax bill, if any of the people, the Republicans who are part of this thing, ever asked the question: Now that we are going to target tax cuts, is it fair? Are we being fair here? Are we targeting it to the right group of people? 
   It seems to me, as I look at least at the early analysis, that that question couldn't have been asked.

   Mr. KERREY. I don't know. I am certain we will have a chance to look at the precise numbers that CBO and others have done. As I look at the numbers right now, it seems our friends on the other side of the aisle, having put this together without Democrats there --if the American people wonder what they lost by not having Democrats there, it doesn't look as if anybody was there to say: Is this fair? 
   What they have said is, we are going to target $4 billion a year of tax cuts to Americans who make more than $319,000 a year. A lot of my friends make more than $319,000 a year, but $4 billion total out of what appears to be about $6 or $7 billion a year seems to be a pretty big targeted tax cut for people over $300,000 a year. For Members of Congress on up, we are a little over $130,000. It is $670 million of targeted tax cuts to that group. But for the group of Americans under $40,000 a year, they get about $50 or $60 million total. 
   I don't know. I guess many of my colleagues felt the same sort of movement of their hearts when they read the stories of the sailors who lost their lives on the U.S.S. Cole. We had a chance to read the biographies. It was a very moving thing to think about their lives. I noted that not a single one of those individuals were college graduates. They were all high school graduates. They were all enlisted, save one who was an ensign, just became an ensign after 12 years of enlistment. If you read their stories, their moms and dads are waiters; their moms and dads are nurses; their moms and dads are schoolteachers; their moms and dads are making less than $40,000 a year. That is a majority of the country. Those are the folks who are running our Little League baseball groups. Those are the people who are volunteering at church. 
   If you decide the Vice President is right--we should not have an across-the-board tax cut; we ought to have a targeted tax cut--it seems to me that we ought to be trying to target it to those folks who are having trouble sending their kids to college, having trouble paying health care, having trouble doing all sorts of other things as well. It seems to me what was missing as they put this thing together was some Democrat raising their hand and saying: Is this fair? 
   I wonder if the Senator from Iowa would agree with that sort of quick analysis.

   Mr. KERREY. I am very sympathetic to the large amount of taxes that higher income Americans are paying. They have been contributing a substantial amount to deficit reduction since President Bush signed into law an increase in their taxes in 1990 and President Clinton essentially continued that in 1993. And the Republican Congress, to their eternal credit, continued it in 1997. We have been generating a lot, and I am grateful for the income. Indeed, I understand why a group of men and women putting together this tax bill would be more sympathetic to people making over $130,000 a year. That is most of us. In fact, indeed, it is all of us. We tend to hang out with people who make more than $130,000 a year, and we complain about our taxes, too. I understand why we are sympathetic. 
   It seems to me what was missing in all of this, what I find to be very difficult to support, now that we have decided the Vice President is correct; we should have a targeted tax cut rather than across the board, I don't think it passes the fairness test. As a consequence, the American people are going to end up, if this becomes law--and the President has indicated he is going to veto it, thank goodness, because if it did become law, they would end up having a very difficult time saying, well, yes, it cut taxes in a targeted way, as the Vice President is suggesting, but it doesn't seem to be a fair proposal.

   Mr. KERREY. It seems nobody was in the room to say: Hey, that doesn't seem to be fair. If you look at the average household--Nebraska and Iowa are pretty close to being the same --the average household in Nebraska pays more payroll taxes than they pay income taxes. Income credits very often don't affect them at all. One of the great paradoxes of allowing people to deduct health insurance is the higher your income, the more subsidy you get. We have an awful lot of people in Nebraska who don't have health insurance as a consequence of where they work. And when they go out and try to buy this health insurance, they don't get as much subsidy as somebody who has a higher income. As a consequence, they are not buying it. As a consequence, we now know it is fact that you are going to be less healthy if you don't have health insurance. My friend from Iowa is exactly right again. It doesn't pass the fairness test.

   Mr. KERREY. Absolutely. It would be fairer to provide full deductibility for the self-employed. The Senator from Iowa and I both represent a lot of self-employed families, many of whom are farmers, and they are increasingly going into town to get the jobs just to get health insurance. Absolutely, it would be more fair. 
   I find most Americans want to do things in a fair way. They want us to tell them the truth about the facts. If they see the facts, they see the struggle that is going on. 
   Again, I wonder if anybody who was sitting in this room putting this tax bill together said, hey, did you see the story that says that now a majority of households in America have both mom and dad working? Did you see the story in the newspaper that said of the 270 American corporations surveyed, 70 percent paid less than the 35 percent effective tax rate, and a large number of them didn't pay any taxes at all because they are using stock options to reduce the cost of their taxes? 
   Did you read the story about Americans with higher incomes saying they don't want to pay any taxes so they will park their accounts down in the Bahamas and get a credit card or a debit card? Did anybody in this room say that is not fair? Maybe we should say to these folks who are down there running their accounts in the Bahamas: The next time you have a fire in your house or need the police force, or need the Navy, why don't you get the Bahamian Navy or the Bahamian police force or the Bahamian firefighters to help you out? 
   I mean, did anybody in this room say, with all the evidence around, this isn't fair? I have to say to my friend from Iowa, it just doesn't pass the fairness test. I think Americans want our laws to be fair. They want us to write fair laws and regulations. They want us to look at society and say it needs to be the land of opportunity for everybody. There are very few Americans who would not like a tax cut. If we are going to target them, as Vice President GORE has been saying, and the Republicans are going to say, we agree, the Vice President is right; we ought to have a targeted tax credit, it seems we ought to try to apply some standard or test of fairness as we do it.

   Mr. KERREY. I have one last question. I find myself saying it doesn't hurt me. I wasn't in the room. It didn't hurt me at all. As a matter of fact, because my income is over $130,000, those folks making the decision in that room helped me out. I guess I should sneak over and thank them for giving me a big tax cut. The people who get hurt are not Members of Congress who weren't in the room; they are Americans who either don't get the targeted benefit or who do get it and say, oh, my gosh, if you are going to do a tax cut, for gosh sakes, help the people who really need it. I think most Americans want our tax laws and the rest of the laws to be as fair as we possibly can make them.

   Mr. KERREY. I am sure my friend knows this, but one of the problems is this: Let's say you have a mom and dad both on minimum wage. That means they are probably making a $14,000 or $15,000 gross salary--maybe a bit more, maybe $16,000 or $17,000. I can't remember, but I think it is $8,000 that the minimum wage will produce. Say both are working 40 hours a week and generating $18,000 to $20,000 a year. FICA is taking a lot of taxes from them to pay the health insurance of a lot of other people. I have a claim on their income.  Every Member of Congress who will get a big tax cut has a claim on their income to pay our health insurance. 
   Did anybody in that room putting the tax proposal together say, hey, I don't think that is fair? Well, that is why you need Democrats in the room. That is why God created Democrats. We sit in the room and say, Is that fair? Sometimes we do it to a fault. That is why we need Republicans to push back and say, Can we afford it? Some of us have Republican and Democrat in us and go back and forth all the time. This isn't fair. As the Senator said, I represent low-income working families without health insurance subsidizing my health insurance. I have a claim on their income. They have no claim on mine, and I am getting a big tax cut. I just say to my friend, does that seem fair to you?

   Mr. KERREY. I think they do understand it. I think they do, but the problem, it seems to me, is you have to step back from time to time and look at the work you are doing, and you have to apply other values, other standards, to it. 
   I just don't, in this case, look at this proposal--and I am not able to reach the conclusion that I am going to target a tax cut, as the Vice President has been calling for, that somebody was in that room saying, gee, we have to make sure it is fair. It just didn't get there. 
   I appreciate very much the Senator answering the questions I have asked of him. I look forward, in fact, to a time when we have our friends on the other side of the aisle engaging in this dialog. 
   Maybe there is an answer here. Maybe somebody was asking the question over and over: Is this fair? I watched with great interest as the Texas Governor talked about compassionate conservatism. I wonder if my friend noticed that some of his Republican friends were saying: Hey, knock that compassion stuff off. You are sounding too much like a Democrat there, let alone acting compassionately. If you use that word too much, you might not get enough people to come out and vote for you. 
   I understand and appreciate when my friends on the other side come and say: You want to make it fair, but we have to afford it. God bless them. Senator MCCAIN earlier was talking about it. God bless Senator MCCAIN for bringing that up. We have to pay attention to the need to keep the economy growing.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, we often use the tax code as a tool to reward certain taxpayer behaviors. Today, I am pleased to introduce a bill that would reward the behavior of individuals or groups who step forward to help finance the digital transmission conversions of the 348 public television stations across the United States. 
   Mr. President, public television is an extremely important public good, which brings creative, non-commercial TV programming of the highest quality to citizens in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and American Samoa. Public television is available to 99 percent of American homes--and serves nearly 100 million people each week. 
   Throughout the U.S., 171 noncommercial, educational licensees operate 348 PBS member stations. Of the 171 licensees, 87 (51%) are community organizations, 55 (32%) are colleges or universities, 21 (12%) are state authorities and 8 (5%) are local educational or municipal authorities. 
   As my colleagues may remember, regulations promulgated by the FCC, pursuant to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, require all public television stations to convert their analog transmission equipment and systems to digital transmission by May 1, 2003. This is a very expensive--though important--Federal government mandate. The mandate is particularly burdensome for public television stations because, as non-profit entities, they rely primarily on the charitable donations of their viewers for financial sustenance. 
   In some states, all of the public television transmission equipment is operated and managed by an umbrella organization. In Nebraska, for example, Nebraska Educational Telecommunications (NET) operates nine transmitters and seventeen translators across the state. The cost of simultaneously replacing all of this equipment in a large, but sparsely populated, state is particularly burdensome. 
   I have been working with public broadcasters in the State of Nebraska to reduce the financial burden imposed by this government mandate. The legislation I am introducing today is the product of our discussions. 
   This legislation will provide a tax credit to individuals or groups that provide funding for the purchase or construction of qualified conversion equipment for a qualified public TV digital conversion project. Qualified conversion equipment would include: transmission towers, transmission equipment, production equipment (including cameras, recorders, software and editing systems), retransmission equipment, and transformers. The proposed tax credit is equal to the full cost of the conversion equipment, but the taxpayer will be limited to 1/6 th of the credit each year over a six-year period. The individuals or groups who fund these conversions would not be able to charge rents for use of the equipment or claim depreciation for the equipment--the tax credit would be the sole benefit. 
   I am confident that citizens and groups across the United States would take advantage of this tax credit for the benefit of their local public television stations. While time is running out for action on this legislation during the 106th Congress, I am hopeful that the 107th Congress will work together with the next Administration to alleviate the financial burden on public television stations through the enactment of this legislation.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, at Pier 12 in the Norfolk Navy Base, along with the Presiding Officer in Norfolk, VA, I joined 10,000 others to mourn and to pay our respects to the families of 17 U.S. Navy sailors who were killed or who are missing following the explosion that ripped into the portside of U.S.S. Cole as she was preparing to set anchor in the Yemen Port of Aden. 
   It was one week ago today at fifteen past midnight that a routine port call became a violent killing of 17 Americans, the wounding of 34 more, and the disabling of a billion dollar destroyer. 
   In attendance at the ceremony to honor those lost on the Cole were many Members of Congress, Attorney General Janet Reno, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, the Secretaries of Defense and the Navy, and the uniformed commanders of the Navy and the Marine Corps. In a gesture of Yemen's cooperation, their Ambassador to the United States, Abdulwahab A. al-Hajjri, was also present. 
   As I sat and listened to the powerful words of President Clinton, Secretary of Defense Cohen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Shelton, and others, I looked at the solemn faces of the Naval officers and enlisted men who stood on the decks of the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Dwight D. Eisenhower and two of the Cole's sister ships, the destroyers Ross and McFaul and wondered how long the unity we felt would last? How long would the moving stories of the lives of these 17 young Americans bind us together? 
   Their stories define what makes America such a unique place. President Clinton captured it perfectly:  
   In the names and faces of those we lost and mourn, the world sees our nation's greatest strength. People in uniform rooted in every race, creed and region on the face of the earth, yet bound together by a common commitment to freedom and a common pride in being American.  
   They were bound together by other common characteristics. Sixteen were enlisted men and women; the lone officer was an ensign who had served more than a decade in the enlisted ranks. None were college graduates, though many saw the Navy as a means to that end. They were from small towns and Navy towns, the places where patriotism burns bright and crowds still form to remember on Memorial Day and Veterans Day. 
   I watched young widows and brothers and fathers cry without restraint or shame when President Clinton read the rollcall of the fallen heros. Sadness gripped me as once more I thought of lives that ended too soon knowing their dreams would not now come true. 
   Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Clark appropriately reminded us that risk is a part of all sailors' lives. When going out to sea, there is never certainty of a joyous homecoming. Death is a frequent visitor in Navy households. Loss is never a complete surprise. 
   However, in this instance it was not the unpredictable ways of the ocean or the violence of a storm that ended these American lives. No, in this instance the killer was a highly sophisticated, high-explosive device set and detonated by as yet unknown villains. 
   There were words from our leaders that addressed the anger we feel in the aftermath of this tragedy. From President Clinton: ``To those who attacked them we say: you will not find a safe harbor. We will find you, and justice will prevail.'' From Secretary of Defense Cohen: ``This is an act of pure evil.'' And from General Shelton: ``They should never forget that America's memory is long and our reach longer.'' 
   Yet, this desire for vengeance is as misplaced as it is understandable. Vengeance is one of the things a terrorist hopes to provoke. Such acts of vengeance--especially when carried out by the United States of America--are bound to provoke sympathy for our enemies. If we are to give meaning to the sacrifice of these men and women, we must take care not to allow the bitter feelings to govern our action. 
   While we await the results of a combined U.S.-Yemeni effort to find out who was responsible for this attack, let me challenge the idea that the attack on the Cole was a pure act of terrorism or criminal action. In my opinion it is not. In my opinion, it is a part of a military strategy designed to defeat the United States as we attempt to accomplish a serious and vital mission. 
   This is the third in a series of violent attacks on the United States dating back to the car bombing of Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia at 10 pm, on Tuesday, June 25, 1996, that killed 19 United States Air Force Airmen and wounded hundreds more. The second attack occurred on August 7, 1998, when U.S. Embassies in Dar es-Salam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya were bombed. These attacks wounded more than 5,000 and killed 224, including twelve Americans who were killed in the Nairobi blast. 
   I believe all three of these incidents should be considered as connected to our containment policy against Saddam Hussein's Iraq. The Cole was heading for the Persian Gulf to enforce an embargo that was authorized by the United Nations Security 
   Council following the end of the Gulf War in 1991. 
   In order to evaluate this incident and put it in its larger context, I had to re-learn the details of the action of Gulf War and its aftermath. The Gulf War began on August 8, 1990, when United States aircraft, their pilots, and their crews arrived in Saudi Arabia. Two days earlier the Saudi King Fahd had asked Secretary of Defense Cheney for help. Saudi Arabia was afraid that Iraq's August 2 invasion of Kuwait would continue south. Without our help they could not defend themselves. Desert Shield--a military operation planned to protect Saudi Arabia--began. 
   At that time, General Norman Schwarzkopf was Commander-in-Chief of Southern Command. On September 8, 1990, he ordered Army planners to begin designing a ground offensive to liberate Kuwait. His instructions from President Bush were to plan for success. We were not going to repeat the mistakes of the Vietnam War. On November 8th, President Bush announced that a decision had been made to double the size of our forces in Saudi Arabia. On November 29, the UN Security Council voted to authorize the use of ``all means necessary'' to drive Iraq from occupied Kuwait. On January 12, 1991, Congress authorized the President to use American forces in the Desert Storm campaign.  
   The campaign began at 2:38 AM on January 17 with Apache helicopters equipped with anti-tank ordnance. The next day Iraq launched Scud missiles against Israel. The first U.S. air attacks, flown out of Turkey, were launched and were continued until February 24 when the ground war began. The ground war was executed with swift precision and was ended at 8 AM on February 28 when a cease fire was declared. 
   The purpose of the Gulf War--to liberate the people of Kuwait--had been accomplished in an impressive and exhilarating display of U.S. power and ability to assemble an alliance of like-minded nations. Afterwards, Iraq was weakened but still led by Saddam Hussein. In their weakened state, they agreed to allow unprecedented inspections of their country to ensure they did not possess the capability of producing weapons of mass destruction. The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to impose an economic embargo on Iraq until the inspections verified that Iraq's chemical, biological, and nuclear programs were destroyed. 
   Contrary to popular belief, the military strategy to deal with Iraq did not end with the February 28, 1991, cease fire. It has continued ever since with considerable cost and risk to U.S. forces. In addition to the embargo, the United States and British pilots have maintained no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq designed to protect the Kurds and Shia from becoming victims of Saddam Hussein's wrath. The purpose of both the embargo and the no-fly zones is to ``contain'' Iraq so that Saddam Hussein does not become a threat in the region again. 
   Unfortunately, this containment object was doomed from the beginning. And while we have begun to change our policy from containment to replacement of the dictator, change has been too slow. The slowness and uncertainty of change has increased the risk for every military person who receives orders to carry out some part of the containment mission. 
   There are three reasons to abandon the containment policy and aggressively pursue the replacement of Saddam Hussein with a democratically elected government. First, it has not worked; Saddam Hussein has violated the spirit and intent of UN Security Council Resolutions. Second, he is a growing threat to our allies in the region. Third, he is a growing threat to the liberty and freedom of 20 million people living in Iraq. 
   As to the first reason, under the terms of paragraph Eight (8) of United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 which passed on April 3, 1991, Iraq accepted the destruction, removal, or rendering harmless of its chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons program. Under the terms of paragraph Nine (9), Iraq was to submit to the Secretary-General ``within fifteen days of the adoption of the present resolution, a declaration of the locations, amounts and types of all items specified in paragraph 8 and agree to urgent, on-site inspection'' as specified in the resolution. 
   From the get-go, Saddam Hussein began to violate this resolution. Over the past decade, he has slowly but surely moved to a point where today no weapons inspectors are allowed inside his country. As a consequence, he has been able to re-build much of his previous capability and is once again able to harass his neighbors. All knowledgeable observers view Iraq's threat to the region as becoming larger not smaller. 
   As to the third reason--his treatment of his own people--there is no worse violator of human rights than Saddam Hussein. The people of Iraq are terrorized almost constantly into compliance with his policies. His jails are among the worst in the world. His appeal for ending sanctions on account of the damage the embargo is doing to his people rings hollow as the food and medicine purchased under the Oil-for-Food Program goes undistributed. Desperately needed supplies sitting in Iraqi warehouses while construction continues on lavish new palaces demonstrates that Saddam Hussein has no real interest in the welfare of his people. Rather, he maintains their misery as means to make political points. 
   If these reasons do not persuade, consider what happened in the other two cases when the United States was attacked. In 1996 we sent an FBI team to Saudia Arabia to investigate Khobar Towers. The investigation led to improving security on other embassies but no other action was taken. In time we have forgotten Khobar. In 1998 following the attack on our embassies in East Africa we sent Tomahawk missiles to bomb a chemical factory in Khartoum, Sudan, and Osama Bin Laden's training compound in Afghanistan. Neither had the decisive impact we sought and may--in the case of Sudan--have been counterproductive. 
   For all these reasons, I hope we will direct the anger and desire for vengeance we feel away from Yemen and towards Saddam Hussein. I hope we will begin to plan a military strategy with our allies that will lead to his removal and replacement with a democratically elected government. This would allow us to end our northern and southern no-fly zone operations, remove our forces from Saudi Arabia, and cease the naval patrols of the Persian Gulf. I can think of no more fitting tribute to the 17 sailors lost on-board the Cole than completing our mission and helping the Iraqi people achieve freedom and democracy. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. If I could respond to say the Senator from New Mexico and any of my colleagues who are uncomfortable and wish I would not do this, if I had not done this the last 6 or 7 years, it is the fault of the Senator from New Mexico. You and Senator Nunn came repeatedly to the floor, I think, in 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1993. I think in 1990, 1991, and 1992 I voted against you, but in 1993 the light bulb came on. It takes me a while to learn, I say to my friend from New Mexico, but I appreciate very much your leadership on these issues.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the 106th Congress appears to be heading towards an ending which will be regarded by many as an orgy of spending. Over the past 12 years when I was approached by citizens who sought additional spending I would invariably reference the spending caps contained in the Budget Act as a way to encourage restraint. But this year, the total spending contained in thirteen FY2001 appropriations bills will be $100 billion over the original spending caps. By drastically increasing the spending baseline, we are adding more than $1 trillion in additional spending over the next ten years. This additional spending is in excess of one dollar of every ten dollars in total U.S. Gross Domestic Product which we propose to collect in taxes and spend. This will be done with nary a debate about the wisdom of our actions. 
   In addition, there are active discussions under way about spending more to ``fix'' the changes we made in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, to cut taxes, and to create a prescription drug benefit for seniors. Before we go any further, we need to step back and take a look at the choices we are making about the budget surplus. 
   The Defense authorization conference report is our first opportunity to do so. Contained in this bill is an authorization that drastically expands the health care entitlement of military retirees over the age of 65--a provision that costs more than was allocated to the Armed Services Committee under current law. The cost of this provision violates our budget rules because it mandates $60 billion in new mandatory spending beyond what is authorized in our budget resolution. Because this provision violates the Budget Act, at least 60 Senators must vote to ignore the budget resolution. While fully I expect 60 Senators will vote to do just that, I hope the debate this afternoon provides us with a better perspective on what we are about to do with the people's money. 
   The provision we are debating about increases health care spending on 1.2 million military retirees and will cost, according to CBO, $60 billion over the next 10 years. But this number is deceiving. By 2010, the annual cost will be nearly $10 billion. I think we have a duty to ask ourselves what problem are we attempting to solve at an eventual annual cost of $10 billion? The provision in the conference report would allow military retirees to remain in TriCare when they turn 65 and would allow these retirees to continue to receive health care provided by the Department of Defense. Currently, when military retirees turn 65, they must transition from a more generous health insurance program called TRICARE to  a less generous program called Medicare where co-payments and deductibles are higher. By changing the law, we will in essence be providing a subsidy for military retiree health insurance coverage that contains no deductibles or co-payments and a generous prescription drug benefit. Imagine the cost if we did the same for all Medicare beneficiaries. 
   I oppose the provision both for policy and budgetary reasons. First, the rhetoric in support of this spending exaggerates the promise that was made to the men and women who volunteered and served in our Armed Forces. Worse, it undermines and reduces the value of the motivation of millions who volunteered with no expectation or desire of being repaid with taxpayer-financed benefits. Our motivation was that it was our duty, and that the service would be good for the nation and for us. In my case, I got a bargain and I do not like the feeling I get when I hear former comrades-in-arms claim they are entitled to some benefit on account of their service. 
   A second objection to this provision is that it is in essence an admission that Medicare is an inadequate program whose coverage is unacceptably poor. Military retirees are not the only former employees in America who must transition from health care provided in the work place to Medicare. You could probably find millions of current Medicare beneficiaries who would stand in line to have their co-payments and deductibles paid as this provision will do for military retirees. If we grant this benefit to military retirees, how soon do you think it will be before non-military retirees will be asking Congress to do the same for them? 
   My third objection is based upon considering the source of the money we will use to pay this subsidy. The source of the money will, of course, be individual and corporate income taxes. 
   Please don't tell me the government is paying for this. That is a euphemism used by politicians and military retirees alike to hide the truth: we will be collecting individual income taxes from millions of working families who cannot afford to buy health insurance in order to subsidize the purchase of Medigap coverage for millions who could afford to pay their premiums. 
   Unfortunately--as is often the case--beneficiaries of this income transfer are better organized and better informed than those who will be paying the bills. As a consequence, there will likely be 60 votes to waive the budget point of order. I doubt there would be 60 votes if the transfer of funds was in the opposite direction: from those who have health insurance to those who do not. 
   My final objection is that the extension of this benefit conflicts with the need we have to invest in our current forces: their salaries, their training, their equipment, and their benefits. Every dollar we commit to increased spending on the mandatory side of our budget--which currently represents two-thirds of total spending--comes at the expense of appropriated spending, defense and non-defense alike. 
   It is very possible that this business of breaking the budget caps may become a habit. If that's the case, then the conflict between mandatory and discretionary spending may become moot. That's the good news. The bad news is, if this happens we will have spent our way back into fiscal deficits. 
   Under the budget law that governs our spending, we should be spending no more than $540 billion on defense and non-defense appropriations. The budget resolution enacted by Congress earlier this year allowed for $600 billion in spending. The appropriations bills we are trying to finish will contain at least $40 billion more. 
   Most Members of Congress are aware--even if most Americans are not--that we cannot do this under the law. To appropriate $640 billion, 60 Senators will have to vote to waive our own budget act to lift the spending caps or to waive the imposition of $100 billion sequester of all defense and non-defense appropriated accounts. 
   My fear is that we will likely take this action as a consequence of our desire to get out of town quickly. We will have minimal debate and will hope that the American people do not notice what we have done until after the election. However, if we were to have an actual debate on this issue, I believe there would be at least two positive outcomes beyond informing the American people of what we are doing. First, domestic spending levels dictated by our budget act are too low. Second, in less than ten years, the pressure of mandatory spending, even presuming lower interest costs, will become enormous. 
   Mr. President, I do not expect to win this vote given the margin of victory when it was considered in the Senate earlier this year. Therefore, I will not take more of my colleague's time with further arguments against this provision. Instead, I want to present a case for increasing defense and non-defense spending, but against the willy-nilly process which will lead to the greatest expansion of domestic spending since Lyndon Johnson was President. After I make this case, I will briefly describe the looming problem of mandatory spending. 
   The good news on spending is that a synergistic combination of federal fiscal discipline and economic growth has shrunk domestic spending as a percentage of total U.S. income to its lowest levels since the middle 1970s. Ten years ago, total Federal spending consumed 22 percent of U.S. GDP. This year, federal spending will be 18 percent of our GDP. According to CBO, if current law is unchanged, total spending will fall to 16 percent in ten years, the lowest percentage of our income since the Eisenhower administration. 
   In current dollars, each 10 percent of GDP represents nearly $1 trillion. It is a tremendous amount of money that causes the people of most other nations on this earth to shake their heads and wonder at our good fortune. Leaving $4 trillion in the economy over the next 10 years for private sector purchases and investments adds a lot of constructive steam to our economy. This fact gets too little attention when we are debating how to sustain our current economic recovery. 
   Mr. President, this is why we need to stop and to consider what we are doing before we quietly agree to spend $1 trillion beyond the original discretionary spending caps. We would be better-served if we made this decision to increase the caps with a coherent and holistic debate about how to invest the surplus. A spending strategy that would increase the productivity of our work force by increasing the percentage of college graduates, and by increasing the number of high school graduates who have the necessary technical training to succeed in the American economy. A thoughtful debate on our spending strategy would no doubt also lead to higher spending levels on early childhood education and adult education. A thoughtful debate on our spending strategy would no doubt recognize the need to invest in our non-human infrastructure of roads, research, sewer and water. And a thoughtful debate on our spending strategy would no doubt contain safeguards to make certain that we do not throw good money after bad. 
   Instead, we are going to commit ourselves to dramatic increases in discretionary and mandatory spending without any unifying motivation beyond the desire to satisfy short term political considerations. To be clear, Mr. President, I do not believe most of these considerations are bad or unseemly. Most can be justified. But we need a larger purpose than just trying to get out of town. 
   On the mandatory side of the spending equation we have allowed the heady talk of surpluses as far as the eye can see to prevent us from seeing the wave of baby boomers that will begin to become eligible for taxpayer subsidized health and retirement benefits in less than 9 years. In less time than our most senior colleagues have served in the Senate, the ratio of American workers being taxed to pay the benefits for those who are eligible will shrink from 3 workers per retiree to 2 workers per retiree. If we continue to vote for more and more spending--as a percentage of our income--on Americans over the age of 65 and less and less on Americans under the age of 18 we will create two terrible problems: workers who do not have the skills to earn the money needed to support their families and a collective working population whose total income is smaller than needed to avoid higher payroll taxes.  
   And yet that is exactly what we are doing with this provision in the Defense authorization conference. We obligate another $60 billion of tax revenue to reduce the burden of buying Medigap insurance. Just this year, a majority of the Senate has voted for a prescription drug benefit, an end to the Social Security earnings test, a decrease in the income tax of Social Security income, and this military retiree provision. Together, these mandatory spending items will cost the American taxpayer more than $500 billion over the next ten years. 
   These spending levels may in fact be justified and affordable. However, they could also end up squeezing our domestic spending further as a percent of GDP. Because entitlement spending programs are locked into law, because those who favor these benefits are well organized and easily provoked come election time, they tend to be protected from spending cuts forever. 
   I ask my colleagues to consider how many votes there would be for a proposal to waive the budget act in order to spend $60 billion more on our children to improve the quality of their health, their education, their lives. How many votes would there be for such a proposition? Less than 60, I assure you. 
   Mr. President, I regret the proposed expansion of tax payer subsidization of military retirees' health benefits will not take place in the context of a more thorough debate of current and future Federal spending. In my view, it would be far less likely that this entitlement expansion would occur if we understood how it will add to the problems created by rapidly growing mandatory spending that begins again just as the full cost of this new benefit kicks in. And it would be far more likely that if we did vote for such an expansion we and the American people would understand the future consequences of our actions. 
   Mr. President, let me say, I regret this may be my last speech on the Senate floor and that it be a speech against extending additional benefits to my fellow veterans or, stated another way, which I think needs to be thought about as we do this, asking other taxpayers to pay some things that I currently pay for myself by asking them to subsidize me even more for the service. 
   I am military retired, let me fully disclose to my colleagues. I will benefit from this provision regardless of what my income is, regardless of what my need is. I say to you, I am personally offended by some of the rhetoric around this. I did not volunteer for the U.S. Navy in order to get anything. And you take away the most important value that I have from my service: I served; I volunteered. You did not have to buy that. You did not have to give me a health care benefit. 
   If you want to give me a health care benefit, give it to me, but please do not say you owe it to me. You may decide it is necessary, but I got more from my service than my country got from me. I am the one who benefited from my service. And I am much less likely to benefit if all of a sudden I become a mercenary. You would owe me money because what this bill does is it says that when our veterans reach age 65, Medicare is not good enough; Medicare will not be good enough for the 1.3 million veterans over the age of 65 who are military retirees; it is not good enough. 
   We are going to buy their Medigap insurance. Oh, no, Medigap isn't good enough. It has to have a prescription benefit in it. That is what this does. It asks one group of taxpayers to pay the Medigap insurance for another group of Americans who say Medicare is not good enough. 
   Look, I know it is a hot issue. I have received lots of phone calls already from people who say: Gee, KERREY is down here trying to stop this. 
   I do not expect to get more than 40 votes. I hope there aren't 60 votes to waive the Budget Act. I say to my colleagues, nothing would send a better signal from this Congress right now than for us to say that we will not waive the Budget Act--that we will not waive the Budget Act. 
   We are not getting much leadership down at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. And there is a spending orgy going on. We are going to have another vote to waive the Budget Act on appropriations. The cap, prior to the budget resolution, was $540 billion. The budget resolution raises it to $600 billion. We all sort of privately know it is going to be $640 billion or $645 billion. That is $100 billion over the previous cap. That is $1 trillion over 10 years. There is a meeting going on amongst Senate Democrats on the Finance Committee, talking to Secretary Summers about a tax cut package. There are lots of discussions going on about putting more money back in, as a consequence of the BBA of 1997, for health care providers. 
   I do not know what it all adds up to, but I will tell you, I have never been in a situation where I took a phone call from somebody who said: Senator, this only costs $60 billion over 10 years--it only costs $60 billion over 10 years. That is what I am getting from people right now. 
   So I think we would send a very important signal, right now, saying that we will not waive the Budget Act, we will not waive the Budget Act that has created the fiscal discipline that enabled us to get to where we are today. I think it would send a very important signal. I understand that you would have to take this thing back to conference 
   tell the House Members we are coming back next week anyway. Isn't it worth $60 billion to spend a little more time to get this thing right? 
   Let me get into the substance of this. I think it is important for us to send a signal that we will not waive the Budget Act to spend only $60 billion over the next 10 years. 
   Let me make the case against the provision. First of all, I reiterate, you don't owe me any additional benefits. This Nation doesn't owe me anything. I will make that case, and I will make it repeatedly because I have heard an awful lot of rhetoric here that implies that I am a mercenary. 
   I am a better person because of my service. I learned from my service. I believe I am a part of a nation as a consequence of my service. I wasn't just in the Navy; I was in the U.S. Navy. It has enriched me. It has benefited me. You didn't have to pay me to get me to do it. I did it as a consequence of believing that it was my duty. I thought I was going to be the one who came out ahead, and I have. 
   Please, in the rhetoric you are using to describe why this is necessary, don't tell me it was a promise. I am one of the beneficiaries of this language, and I wasn't promised any benefit when I signed up. If you want to give it to me, fine, but please don't tell me that you owe it to me. 
   Secondly, it is important for us to do some sort of evaluation of need. The last time I checked, I didn't see an awful lot of military retirees out there foraging in the alley for food. We need to do some sort of evaluation of need. Remember, we are taking $60 billion over the next 10 years from one group of Americans, and we are going to pay for the Medigap insurance, including a prescription drug benefit, for another group of Americans. 
   I don't know how many Americans we are going to tax who are out there right now saying, I don't have enough income to pay for my health insurance, but there are a number who are. They are sitting out there, hard-working families, paying their bills, who are an important part of our country as well, who are an important part of our society. 
   We are not saying to them, you are entitled to Medigap insurance. We are not saying to them, you are entitled to a prescription drug benefit. What you are entitled to is to pay somebody else's bills. Remember, the Government doesn't pay for anything. All we do is collect the money and pay the bills for somebody else. We are obligating $60 billion over 10. In the tenth year, this thing is knocking on the door of being $10 billion a year at the very moment--which is my third point--at the very moment when we have this unprecedented baby boom generation that begins to retire. 
   I know this surplus goes as far as the eye can see. I understand that it has gotten more difficult to say no to people as a consequence of that; the fiscal discipline is lucid. But we are not going to change this demographic boom that is heading our way. It is not going to be altered. There aren't enough H-1B visas we can issue to immigrate our way out of this problem. We aren't going to have three people working who we tax to pay the retirement and health care benefits of those who aren't working. We are only going to have two. We are going to have two workers  per retiree. You don't get to pick Warren Buffet and Bill Gates to tax. You tax an average. 
   As a consequence of taxing that average, we are going to have a very difficult time paying the bills. Everybody who has 
   examined this says that is the case. It is true that right now, under the previous CBO evaluation, we have stabilized the cost of mandatory programs, but not for long. We are going to be right back off to the races again starting in 2009. Our Federal Government, unless we exhibit some restraint, is going to become an ATM machine. We are going to be collecting money from one group of taxpayers and shipping it on to another group of taxpayers. 
   The reason it is a problem can be seen in the way our authorizers had to deal with this. They didn't want this money to come out of Defense appropriations. They didn't want it to come out of readiness accounts. They didn't want it to come out of our ability to be able to recruit, to train, and equip our forces. No. They want to protect that. So they push it all over into mandatory. 
   Well, you can only push it so far. I am sure the chairman of the Budget Committee will say at some point you have a limited amount of money you can extract from the U.S. economy. If you have a limited amount of money and you have mandatory programs going, it is going to eventually put pressure on appropriated accounts. The paradox, in my view--not shared by all--is that we probably are underinvesting right now in things that will increase productivity and will increase the strength of our economy. It is a paradox because we are going to be taxing the very people in whom we are underinvesting because we don't have a sufficient amount of resources in the appropriated accounts. 
   As I said, on the basis of policy, I think on the basis of fiscal discipline, on several other bases I could talk about, this sounds good. Again, I understand the pressure. Nobody organizes better than Americans over the age of 65 in order to get something they think they are entitled to. In a relatively short period of time, I have generated well over 75 phone calls, including one misguided human being who said he was going to do everything in his power to make sure that my Medal of Honor was taken away from me. Well, more power to him; have at it. It is not likely. I am not offended by that. It is just an indication of the intensity of people's feelings, to which they are entitled. They don't tell us where we are going to get the money. The Government is going to pay for it; that is as far as they will go. Let the Government pay for it. 
   The Government--I say again, for emphasis--doesn't pay for anything. It collects. It taxes one group of people in order to pay the benefits for another. That is what we are doing. You have a very difficult time, either on the basis of promise or on the basis of need, making the case that this group of Americans needs to have us pay their Medigap insurance, including a prescription drug benefit. 
   I hope my colleagues, at this moment when we seem to have lost our fiscal discipline, will come to the floor and say: I might have, under normal circumstances, liked to be able to help these military retirees, but we have to stand up and say, no, we are going down a road where, when the smoke clears, we are going to find ourselves looking pretty foolish for having spent all the money or committed all the money that we have done. 
   I hope my colleagues, even those who might say they like this benefit, will not vote to waive the Budget Act. The Budget Act has given us the discipline that enabled us to get this far. To sort of willy-nilly come down here and say, fine, my phone is ringing off the hook, I will not be able to stand up to that, I 
   have to say, yes. The Budget Act allowed us to turn to our citizens and say, we have to be disciplined. It gave me, for 12 years, a method by which I could say, look, I support what you are doing, but we don't have the money. We have to say no sometimes to things we want to spend money on. 
   I hope my colleagues will come to the floor and muster the will to vote no on waiving this Budget Act.

   Mr. KERREY. I am pleased to, Mr. President. First of all, I am a retired Naval officer for medical reasons. The Senator is quite right; there is a difference between the reason I signed up, how I did it as a reserve officer, and somebody who signs up for 20 years. No question, that is true. I don't mean to imply there isn't a difference; there is a significant difference. When I hear people describing what this benefit does, that we are only talking about people who are in 20 years, the rhetoric is far afield on this. 
   I feel like I can't go home and talk to friends and neighbors and say I am getting one more thing from my Government here. I am just telling you that I don't feel as if this country owes me anything. I want my colleagues, especially those who didn't have any military service, to know that. I have gotten more out of it than my Nation got. You say, well, somebody who has been in 20 years should be promised health care. There are employees we promised health care to. I say this to the Senator from Virginia: Medicare is health care. What do you say to somebody who has been in the workforce who says, ``My employer promised me health care, and I get to be 65 and I have to have Medicare.'' Do we say we are going to pick that up as well? That will be the next thing knocking on our door.

   Mr. KERREY. I don't disagree, but to fix Medicare by saying there will not be copayments or deductibles, I don't think there is anybody on the floor who would argue that eliminating copayments and deductibles is the way to save money in health care. Quite the opposite. The argument on the other side of the aisle--joined by me in 1997--is we should go in the opposite direction. This eliminates copayments and deductibles.

   Mr. KERREY. It will take 30 seconds to respond. On that basis, my Government owes me a lot of travel. They promised me I was going to see the world. All I saw was Vietnam, right? So I go to OCS for, they told me 16 weeks; it was 18 weeks. Guess what they said. ``We lied to you. Big deal.'' We have a lot of promises we have to keep if we are going to fulfill every promise made at every recruiting office in the United States. Come on, this is about deciding how much we can afford. There is a limit. I know the chairman understands there is a limit. There is a point beyond which one can't go. Are we going to do long-term care? Are we going to promise to pay for that? There are lots of things we can pay for and say we have an obligation. 
   The question before us is, Are we going to waive the Budget Act? This Defense conference authorization requires $60 billion worth of spending beyond the budget resolution. That is the question, not do you like what this is. You may like this particular provision. But I am telling you, with just a couple of days left in this Congress, we are on a spending orgy. I am having people saying to me: Don't worry about waiving the budget resolution on appropriations; don't worry about waiving the budget resolution on Defense authorization; don't worry, we have to get out of town. Well, we are going to get out of town having done an awful lot of damage if we take that attitude.

I am prepared to yield back time and go to the vote. I don't know where they are, but I will start talking so they understand that is where I am. 
   The Senator from Texas made an effort to establish his bona fides and did a very good job referencing his father, who was a career military officer. 
   In my closing, I need to do a little subtracting in my bona fides. I have received the Medal of Honor, as was mentioned several times. The Senator from Texas said he was not there that night and does not know what happened. When I saw the citation, I didn't know if I was there that night. I didn't receive the Medal of Honor because of my heroism. I received it because of many men out there, heroic beyond me, who did not have a witness or had a witness who did not like them or could not write or something got lost in the food chain, as some of these sometimes do. I am a recipient for others, and I do not say that in any sense of false modesty at all. I say it sincerely and genuinely. 
   I understand Reserve officers, which I am, and career officers are substantially different. I praise the chairman and the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee and all the members of the Armed Services Committee, some of whom already spoke, for their efforts to make certain we take care of the men and women who volunteer and say: I will make a life career. I do not want anything I said previously to subtract from the enormous respect and admiration I have for them. Indeed, many times I have been moved to tears to see the risks the men and women who wear the uniform of the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard take for all of us, and we have a painful example of it today in sailors who are trying to keep an embargo in place on Iraq. 
   We started that embargo many years ago, and we take it for granted. All of a sudden, we have 5 dead, 10 missing, and another 30 or so who are injured executing a mission. My guess is many of those people in question are lifers, as we call them, people who have made a life commitment. 
   I appreciate very much the chairman making an effort. It may be he is right, that he has a provision here that ought to be done. I tried to argue as to why I think it goes beyond. He is the chairman of this committee. Senator LEVIN spent a lot of time on it. I supported them almost every time in the past when they tried to get benefits in line with what we need in order to recruit and retain. I do not want anything I said previous to this to be interpreted by anybody either on this floor or out in America that I have any disrespect at all for the commitment that men and women make when they say: I will make a life career. 
   Again, I will use the observation of the Senator from Texas that you can support this provision and still say at some point you have to say no. We all understand that. We are asked to spend the taxpayers' money on many things, and you need a method by which at some point you say no. You can't say yes to everything. There are a lot of things I would like to spend money on, but there is a limit, and you have to figure out what that limit is.  
   For years we had a Budget Act. For years we had budget caps. The Senator from New Mexico is right. It used to be, not that long ago, when you came down to the floor and there was a motion to waive the Budget Act, that was a tough vote. It was tough to waive the Budget Act. All of a sudden, it is not anymore. It used to be a mechanism that enabled us to have the fiscal discipline. 
   I am proud of many things in which I had the opportunity to participate. One of them is the opportunity to help get rid of the fiscal deficit over the last 12 years. The only way that was possible was for us to have a mechanism by which we could look at a friend, look somebody in the eye who deserves to have more spending, and say: No, I just can't do it. 
   At this moment, we are poised to spend far beyond what we intended when this year started. I hope colleagues will vote against the motion to waive the Budget Act and send this bill back to conference and say to the House Members: We cannot get it in because we have to say no, and we have to reassert the fiscal discipline that got us to where we are today. 
   Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back my time.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, many of the things we do in the Senate involve making investments in America's future. Investments in research through the National Science Foundation or investments in infrastructure development through the Department of Transportation reap great rewards for the citizens of tomorrow. 
   Today, I am pleased to be joined by Senators SANTORUM, MOYNIHAN, GRASSLEY, and BREAUX in introducing a piece of legislation that represents a remarkable new investment in the financial security of future generations of Americans. 
   This proposal, called KidSave, aims to give every American a stake in the growth of the American economy, to help all Americans accumulate wealth and assets, and to teach all Americans firsthand the value of savings and compounding interest. Not only will this legislation promote savings and investments across all income levels, but it will also help to close the growing wealth gap. 
   One of the discoveries I have made in researching this idea is that the most important variable in compounding interest rates is time. The earlier you start, the more wealth you build. 
   One of the poster children for understanding the value of compounding interest is Osceola McCarty. Osceola was a Hattiesburg, Mississippi, washerwoman, who after more than seven decades of low-wage work donated $150,000 to the University of Southern Mississippi--wealth she had built by saving a little bit of money over a long period of time. 
   Wealth has also empowered the Federal employees I talk to in the halls of the Senate, who are excited about their ability to participate in their government Thrift Savings Plan, TSP, and who talk more knowledgeably than me about index funds and the difference between a stock and bond. These employees, and other workers across the country who are able to participate in employer-sponsored pension plans and IRAs, feel more confident about their own futures and their own retirement security. They are confident that they won't face poverty in their final years. 
   Our KidSave proposal will gave that same sense of confidence and pride in one's future to all future generations of Americans. 
   How does KidSave work? The KidSave program would use part of the surplus to provide each newborn child with a $2,000 KidSave retirement savings loan to jumpstart his or her retirement savings. Each KidSave loan will be deposited into a qualified KidSave account. The KidSave program will be administered by the Thrift Savings Plan, TSP, Board. Future KidSave loans will be adjusted for inflation, CPI, beginning in 2008. 
   Parents and grandparents will be able to add $500 per year to each KidSave account for each child under the age of 19.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the legislation pending before the Senate on Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China. I support this bill not only because it is in the best interest of American farmers, businesses, and consumers; but also because passage of PNTR is the best way for America to have a positive influence on China's domestic policies, including policies affecting basic human rights. 
   I believe that this bill has been characterized by many of my esteemed colleagues as something that it is not--a reward to China despite its poor human rights record. Surely, we do not agree with the treatment of China's citizens, just as surely as we do not agree with so many other practices of the Chinese government. However, it is important to remember that China will become a member of the WTO no matter how we vote. If the Congress were to vote against Permanent Normal Trade Relations, many of our trading partners will receive the myriad benefits of trading with China, while our farmers, our businesses, ..... our citizens would be excluded. 
   Furthermore, the interest we have in promoting human rights protection in China is not defeated with the passing of this bill. The Congress has used its annual review of Normal Trade Relations to push China to become more democratic, to treat its citizens with basic decency, and to discourage Chinese participation in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We now have the opportunity to assist our allies in bringing China into the world trading community. And by bringing China further into the global community, the real beneficiaries of PNTR, and eventual membership in the WTO, will be the Chinese people. The Chinese people will benefit from the new economic opportunities created by increased trade. The Chinese people will benefit from the spread of the rule of law, from increased governmental transparency, and from the economic freedom which will come as a consequence of China's membership in the WTO. Finally, passage of PNTR will make it much more likely that the Chinese people will have the opportunity to do what so many Chinese-Americans have done in the United States. By harnessing the power of individual innovation and by starting businesses, the Chinese people will be able to generate new wealth and new opportunities for themselves and their children. 
   While the rewards of membership are evident, let us not overlook the responsibilities that come with membership in that community--particularly the responsibilities that come with membership in the WTO. What better way to promote democracy in China, a nation that has long lacked a strong rule of law, than to encourage its participation in institutions, like the WTO, with strong dispute resolution mechanisms. Membership in the WTO will cause China to reexamine its legal infrastructure. Violating WTO agreements brings real consequences--the imposition of trade sanctions. 
   This is a historic opportunity. We will soon be voting on one of the most important bills ever debated in this body. I will support Permanent Normal Trade Relations for China and I hope that my colleagues will recognize this bill's importance, and give it their support. 
   Let me remind my colleagues that granting PNTR is not a reward for China, it is a reward for US farmers, businesses, and consumers. Passage of PNTR would allow the US to take advantage of the concessions agreed to by China in the bilateral agreement during its accession process. Tariffs for US goods will be drastically reduced.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr President, I would like to note the release of a recent publication that all members of Congress should read. This new publication was produced by the Clean Fuels Development Coalition and it includes a presentation of facts about ethanol-based ethers. 
   As we attempt to deal with the water contamination problems resulting from leaking underground storage tanks, much of the debate is focusing on methanol-based ethers, i.e. MTBE. While MTBE has played an important role in reducing ozone throughout the U.S., the problems of water contamination have lead many to advocate limiting or even banning this product.  During this debate a few of our colleagues have expressed confusion about the technical characteristics of ethanol-based ethers, like ETBE. Some have assumed that ethanol-based ethers have characteristics identical to MTBE. As both the Senate and House examine this issue, it is important to be aware of the significant differences between the two products. 
   For example, ethanol is a renewable, biodegradable product. When converted into ether, ETBE has many favorable characteristics in terms of the way it reacts in soil, water, and air, when compared to MTBE. In the event ETBE escapes into the atmosphere or our water supplies, it can be cleaned up much more efficiently than MTBE. ETBE is far less persistent than MTBE and remediation technologies have shown to be very effective. 
   Understanding the attributes of ETBE is also important at a time when every citizen is painfully aware of our dependence on imported petroleum and the relationship of supply and price. It may be possible to use ETBE in volumes up to 22 percent in gasoline. This addition of a clean, domestic fuel could significantly impact our gasoline supply situation, particularly in our most heavily populated and polluted urban areas. 
   I have long been a supporter of ETBE and while there are a number of technical and market challenges remaining before this fuel reaches full commercialization, its promise is undeniable. The petroleum industry, environmental groups, ethanol producers, and the auto industry have long recognized the superior qualities of ETBE. For that promise to be realized we need to ensure that ETBE is not included in any ban or limitation of fuels that result from leaking underground storage tank problems. I commend the Clean Fuels Development Coalition for their continued support of this important fuel as well as my own state of Nebraska which has more than a decade of experience in ETBE development. 
   Mr. President, at this time I would ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Clean Fuels Development Coalition fact book on ETBE be entered into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to talk about inter-generational issues related to Federal budget spending. We will never have a better time to consider such issues as inter-generational equity than now during a time of large projected surpluses. These large projected surpluses provide us with a great deal more flexibility in choosing among priorities and in determining our legacy to future generations. 
   Until recently, we were not so lucky. For more than thirty years, the budget projection reports from the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget were a source of growing despair for the American people. As each year went by, CBO and OMB would present worse news: larger deficits, larger national debt levels, and larger net interest payments. As the government's appetite for debt expanded, fewer and fewer dollars were available for private investment. 
   In the beginning, experts explained that deficits were a good thing because they stimulated economic growth and created jobs. Over time, however, the voices of experts opposed to large deficits grew louder; they argued that deficits caused inflation, increased the cost of private capital, mortgaged away our future--just at the time when we needed to be preparing for the retirement of the large Baby Boom generation. As the opinions of the experts shifted, so did public opinion. 
   During the 1980s and 1990s, the federal deficit became public enemy number one. Great efforts were made to understand it, to propose solutions to reduce it, and to explain how much better life would be without it. During election season, the air-waves were filled with promises and plans to get rid of the deficit and pay off the national debt. Editorial page writers reached deep into their creative reservoir to coin new phrases and create new metaphors to describe the problem. Books were published. Nonprofit organizations were created. Constitutional amendments were called for. There was even a new political party created on account of the deficit. 
   In the 1990s--and at great political risk--we finally started taking action to control the size of the deficits and the growth of the national debt. I am proud to have participated in and voted for three budget acts--in 1990, 1993, and 1997--which have radically altered the fiscal condition of the Federal government and the debate about how the public's hard-earned tax dollars should be spent. 
   The enactment of these three budget acts--particularly the 1993 and 1997 budget acts--coupled with impressive gains in private sector productivity and economic growth led to a remarkable reversal of our deficit and debt trends. Deficits started shrinking in 1994. We celebrated our first unified budget surplus of $70 billion in 1998. Over the next 10 years, if we maintain current spending and revenue policies, CBO projects an eye-popping unified budget surplus of $4.5 trillion. I am proud that we are able to celebrate the fruits of our fiscal restraint because we had the sheer will and political courage to put ourselves on a spending diet. 
   Today, however, I want to call your attention to what could be called the ``unintended consequences'' of our fiscal responsibility. Not only have we allowed total Federal spending to dip below 20% of GDP 
   levels not seen since the mid-1970s), but we are also on course to let spending drop to 15.6% of GDP by 2010. We have not seen spending levels this low since the 1950s. At the same time as total spending is declining as a percentage of GDP, the make up of our Federal spending is continuing to shift insignificant ways. An increasingly larger proportion of our spending is used for mandatory spending programs compared to discretionary spending programs. These numbers have important implications for the measurement of inter-generational equity. 
   Now that we have constrained spending and eliminated our budget deficits, the budget debate has shifted to questions about how to spend the surplus: on debt reduction, on tax cuts, on new discretionary spending programs, on fixing Social Security, or on creating a new Medicare prescription drug benefit? 
   I favor all of these things to varying degrees, as I suspect most of you do. The trick is to find the right balance among these initiatives. In finding the right balance, I believe one of the most important criterion in determining how to use these surpluses should be measuring inter-generational equity. Not only do we need to assess the amount of money we invest on our seniors versus our children, but we also need to assess the trends of mandatory versus discretionary spending. 
   Let me start with my own assessment of Federal spending on children and seniors. Today, the Federal government spends substantially more on seniors over the age of 65 than it does on children under the age of 18. For example, in 2000, the Federal government spent roughly $17,000 per person on programs for the elderly, compared with only $2,500 per person on programs for children. This means that at the Federal level, we are spending seven times  as much as people over the age of 65 as on children under the age of 18. 
   Even when we consider that states are the primary funders of primary and secondary education, the combined level of State and Federal spending still shows a dramatic contrast in spending on the old versus the young. At the state and Federal level, we are still spending 2.5 times the amount of money on people over the age of 65 as on children under the age of 18. 
   Given these discomforting facts, it might seem logical that most of the current proposals for spending surplus dollars would be for investments in our children. Instead, this Congress has been proposing and voting to spend a major portion of the surpluses on the most politically organized voting bloc in the nation--those over the age of 65. 
   In the Senate alone, we have either acted on, or are expected to act on, the following proposals which directly benefit seniors only: 
   Eliminating the Social Security earnings test for workers over the age of 65 (10-year price tag: $23 billion) 
   Allowing military retirees to opt out of Medicare and into TriCare or FEHBP (10-year price tag: $90 billion) 
   Creating a new universal Medicare prescription drug benefit for seniors (10-year price tag: $300 billion) 
   Medicare provider ``give-backs'' package (10-year price tag: $40 billion) 
   Increasing the Federal income tax exemption provided to Social Security beneficiaries (10-year price tag: $125 billion) 
   If Congress actually enacted all of these popular 
   provisions into law, spending for seniors over the next 10 years would increase by $578 billion--an amount equivalent to this year's entire discretionary spending budget. 
   At the same time as we are proposing, voting in favor of, and enacting legislation to improve benefits and tax cuts for seniors, we will be lucky to get legislation passed that will spend only an additional $10 billion on children under the age of 18. 
   Why? The answer is not simply because seniors are politically organized voters and children are not. We also have to look at how most programs for seniors are funded versus programs for children. As the members of the Senate are well aware, most programs for seniors are funded through mandatory/entitlement spending. Spending increases in these programs are not subject to the annual appropriations process and are protected by automatic cost-of-living-adjustments (COLA) each year. 
   The spending programs that primarily benefit our children, on the other hand, are discretionary, which means they are subject to the annual appropriations process. There are no automatic spending increases when it comes to programs for our kids. Instead, most programs for kids are held victim to politics and spending caps. 
   As a result, the proportion of Federal government spending on mandatory versus discretionary spending has undergone a dramatic shift. Back in 1965, the Federal government spent the equivalent of 6% of GDP on mandatory entitlement programs like Social Security and 12% of GDP on discretionary funding items like national defense, education, and public infrastructure. Put another way: 35 years ago, one-third of our budget funded entitlement programs and two-thirds of our budget funded discretionary spending programs. 
   The situation has now reversed. Today, we spend about two-thirds of our budget on entitlement programs and net interest payments and only one-third of our budget on discretionary spending programs. 
   I am particularly troubled by the decline in spending on discretionary spending initiatives. Although our tight discretionary spending budget caps were a useful tool in the past for eliminating deficits and lowering debt, they are not useful today in helping us assess the discretionary budget needs of the nation. Today, appropriated spending is contained through spending caps that are too tight for today's economic reality. We are left with a discretionary budget that bears little relationship to the needs of the nation and that leaves us little flexibility to solve some of the big problems that still need to be addressed: health care access for the uninsured, education, and research and development in the areas of science and technology. 
   The downward pressure on discretionary spending will become worse during the retirement of the Baby Boom generation--when the needs of programs on the mandatory spending side will increase dramatically. The coming demographic shift towards more retirees and fewer workers is NOT a ``pig in a python'' problem as described by some commentators whose economics are usually better than their metaphors. The ratio of workers needed to support each beneficiary does not increase after the baby boomers have become eligible for benefits. It remains the same. 
   In 10 years, the unprecedented demographic shift toward more retirees will begin. The number of seniors drawing on Medicare and Social Security will nearly double from 39 million to 77 million. The number of workers will grow only slightly from 137 to 145 million. Worse, if we continue to under-invest in the education and training of our youth, we will 
   have no choice but to continue the terrible process of using H-1B visas to solve the problem of a shortage of skilled labor. 
   One of the least understood concepts regarding Social Security and Medicare is that neither is a contributory system with dedicated accounts for each individual. Both are inter-generational contracts. The generations in the work force agree to be taxed on behalf of eligible beneficiaries in exchange for the understanding that they will receive the same benefit when eligible. Both programs are forms of social insurance--not welfare--but both are also transfer payment programs. We tax one group of people and transfer the money to another. 
   The proportion of spending on seniors--and the proportion of mandatory spending--will most surely increase as the baby boomers become eligible for transfer payments. Unless we want to raise taxes substantially or accrue massive amounts of debt, much of the squeeze will be felt by our discretionary spending programs. The spiral of under-investment in our children and in the future work force will continue. Our government will become more and more like an ATM machine. 
   What should we do about this situation? 
   I recommend a two step approach. Step one is to honestly assess whether can ``cut our way out of this problem''. Do you think public opinion will permit future Congresses to vote for reduction in the growth of Medicare, Social Security, and the long-term care portion of Medicaid? At the moment my answer is a resounding ``no''. Indeed, as I said earlier, we can currently heading the opposite direction. 
   Step number two is to consider whether it is time for us to rewrite the social contract. The central question is this: Do the economic and social changes that have occurred since 1965 justify a different kind of safety net? I believe they do. I believe we need to rewrite and modernize the contract between Americans and the Federal government in regards to retirement income and health care. 
   We should transform the Social Security program so that annual contributions lead all American workers--regardless of income--to accumulate wealth by participating in the growth of the American economy. Whether the investments are made in low risk instruments such as government bonds or in higher risk stock funds, it is a mathematical certainty that fifty years from now a generation of American workers could be heading towards retirement with the security that comes with the ownership of wealth--if we rewrite the contract to allow them to do so. 
   Not only should we reform Social Security to allow workers to personally invest a portion of their payroll taxes, but we should also make sure those account contributions are progressive so that low and moderate income workers can save even more for their retirements. At the same time, it is important to make the traditional Social Security benefit formula even more progressive so that protections against poverty are even stronger for our low income seniors. Finally, it is important to change the law so that we can keep the promise to all 270 million current and future beneficiaries--and that will mean reforming the program to restore its solvency over the long-term. 
   In addition to reforming Social Security, we should end the idea of being uninsured in this nation by rewriting  our Federal laws so that eligibility for health insurance occurs simply as a result of being a citizen or a legal resident. We should fold existing programs--Medicare, Medicaid, VA benefits, FEHBP, and the income tax deduction--into a single system. And we should subsidize the purchase of health insurance only for those who need assistance. Enacting a Federal law that guarantees health insurance does not mean we should have socialized medicine. Personally, I favor using the private markets as much as possible--although there will be situations in which only the government can provide health care efficiently. 
   One final suggestion. With budget projections showing that total Federal spending will fall to 15.6% of GDP by 2010, I urge my colleague to consider setting a goal of putting aside a portion of the surpluses--perhaps an amount equivalent to one-half to one percent of GDP--for additional discretionary investments. Investments that will improve the lives of our children both in the near future and over the long term--investments in education, research and development, and science and technology. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, today I wish to join my colleagues, Senator MURKOWSKI, GORTON, and JEFFORDS in introducing legislation that will help ensure that customers receive reliable and affordable electricity. The Electric Power Industry Tax Modernization Act is the culmination of months-long discussions between shareholder-owned utilities and publicly-owned utilities. Without the diligence and patience exhibited by these groups, it is doubtful that Congress could be in the position to act on this issue. Additionally, I would like to recognize the efforts of Senator MURKOWSKI and Senator GORTON, whose efforts at getting these groups to sit down and discuss these issues was invaluable to the final agreement. 
   Mr. President, this legislation will ensure that Nebraskans continue to benefit from the publicly-owned power they currently receive. Nebraska has 154 not-for-profit community-based public power systems. It is the only state which relies entirely on public power for electricity. This system has served my state well as Nebraskans enjoy some of the lowest electricity rates in the nation. 
   In closing, I would urge my colleagues to join this bipartisan effort to address the changes steaming from electrical restructuring.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the Low Power Radio Act of 2000 with Senator MCCAIN. Low power FM radio is an effort to bring more diversity to the airwaves. Though radio airwaves belong to the public, only a handful of people currently control what we hear on-air. Low power FM will expand that number by thousands, giving a voice to local governments, community groups, churches, and schools. 
   I understand that there is some concern that these new low-power signals will interfere with existing full-power stations. I believe these fears are greatly exaggerated. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has decades-long experience dealing with FM-spectrum issues, and they have conducted extensive testing to ensure that these new stations will not cause interference. 
   Should interference occur, however, I believe that full-power stations must have a process for alleviating the problem. The Low Power Radio Act allows any broadcaster or listener to file a formal complaint with the FCC. If the FCC determines that a low-power station is causing harmful interference, the low power station will be removed from the airwaves while a technical remedy is found. To discourage frivolous complaints, however, the FCC is authorized to assess reimbursement of costs associated with the proceeding as well as punitive damages onto any full-power station who files a complaint without any purpose other than to impede a low-power radio transmission. 
   This initiative has undergone a considerable period of testing and public comment. Delaying implementation will only result in more conflicting engineering studies without guaranteeing that interference will not occur. I believe that it is time to let low power FM go forward. The Low Power Radio Act gives the FCC the authority to resolve harmful interference complaints on a case-by-case, common sense basis. It is a compromise that can work to the benefit of existing broadcasters, potential low power licensees, and all radio listeners.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am here, along with Senator BAUCUS, as well as Senator DORGAN, Senator BREAUX, and Senator ROBB, to talk about rescission of the estate tax that we think needs to be addressed. I believe the estate tax is unfair. 
   I worked with Senator KYL of Arizona to write a bill to eliminate the estate tax, along with a stepped-up basis for capital gains which I think is reasonable. 
   Unfortunately, there are two problems I have with the legislation. One is that I see many other provisions in the Tax Code that I also don't think are fair. I think the payroll tax is too high. 
   If you ask me what the No. 1 item is in terms of eliminating, I would like to see the payroll tax reduced. I think it is too high. It is a barrier to savings. It especially falls very hard on those Americans to whom we are trying to give the most opportunity. I would like to see full deductibility of health insurance. 
   There are a lot of things that I would like to see done. But I have to measure the cost of those against the budget itself to try to maintain the fiscal discipline we have had since 1993. 
   As a consequence, I think what Senator DASCHLE has proposed as an alternative is reasonable. 
   In addition to that, if we are going to help 2 percent of Americans, it is very important for us to pay attention and try to help the 98 percent of Americans who do not have any estate. Senator BAUCUS has a proposal that will do just that. 
   The proposal that I want to talk about a bit is a proposal called KidSave that will similarly help 98 percent of the population of American citizens who head toward old age and have no estate beyond $650,000 that can be taxed under any circumstances, 
   which is rather shocking when you consider how easy it is to accumulate $650,000. 
   The proposal I have, and I have talked about it before--in fact, I worked with Republicans as well to refine and improve it--is called KidSave. It is based on a very simple mathematical certainty; that is, if you want to accumulate wealth, the most important variable is the length of time over which you save. KidSave opens an account, administered by the Social Security Administration, but very similar to what we have with the Thrift Savings Plan. It opens an account of $1,000 at birth. If you contribute $500 in the first 5 years, you have $3,500 at age 5; and over the next 55 years, that $3,500 is using compounding interest rates. 
   The investment strategy is similar to the Thrift Savings Plan. Members have not only invested in it ourselves, we have employees invested in it. We become very excited about what it can do for individuals. For example, the C Fund we have available, over the last 12 years, has averaged an 18-percent compounded rate of return. It is lower if you pick a bond fund, lower than that if you pick a Treasury bond fund. The idea it is unsafe is an idea that doesn't make any sense to our employees who operate and live under that program. It gives them a chance to have something when they head towards retirement that provides them with real security--and that is wealth. 
   Members will find, talking to people who are concerned about the estate tax, as I have--and I think the estate tax is unfair; you can't justify 55-percent taxation especially when you bring the stepped-up basis in--when we talk to people, it provides them with a sense of security. It is not Social Security, but the wealth that accumulates provides them with a sense of security. 
   I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I know the debate is not heading in that direction, unfortunately. We are basically going to have a series of amendments which will go to the President, and he will veto the darn thing and we have our political issues. 
   I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are concerned about the impact on 2 percent of the population, what Senator BAUCUS and Senator DORGAN and Senator BREAUX and myself are trying to say is, let's express simultaneously a concern for that 98 percent of American people who are working and have no prospect right now of accumulating an estate in excess of $650,000. It is not a gamble. It is a mathematical certainty. If these accounts are opened early enough and continued over a course of a working life, every single individual in America could head towards retirement knowing that they, too, are going to have a sufficient estate to pass on to their heirs. Not only is it respectable, but it will give them security, as well. 
   I understand there are concerns with KidSave. We worked with Republicans to try to improve it, try to make certain that it accommodates some ideological concerns. I am willing to continue doing that effort. If we are going to be concerned that 2 percent of the population would have to pay estate taxes on estates in excess of $650,000, I believe this Senate should be similarly concerned about 98 percent of the population that heads towards retirement in older age with estates that are under $650,000. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I appreciate that. When I talk of the estate tax, understanding there could be genuine differences of opinion--and the distinguished Senator from New York likes the estate tax. I look at it and I think it is unfair. I hear people say it only affects 2 percent of the population. I say 2 percent are getting the shaft. We ought to still try to help them, whether they are wealthy or not. I don't like the tax. 
   What is more startling to me is 98 percent of the population do not have an estate over $650,000. Think about that, if $1,000 at birth, compounded at 10 percent, produces $650,000. 
   I am not arguing that will happen over 60 years, but if you look at the Thrift Savings Plan, it has compounded at 18 percent in the C fund over the last 12 years. It is a remarkable rate of return. It is absolutely certain. If we want to help the 98 percent that don't have estates over $650,000, it is absolutely a mathematical certainty that we can do it. One cannot wait until 55. One cannot wait until 65. One cannot wait even until 45. Start early. The earliest possible moment is at birth. Open these accounts at birth and contribute early. 
   One objection I heard on the other side is it ought to be an ``earned'' entitlement. We worked with heritage to make it earned entitlement. I am willing to do that. If you understand compounding interest rates, and if you are startled not by the fact that only 2 percent have estates over $650,000 but  that 98 percent haven't reached $650,000--that is a startling number; it is not good. Inside of a liberal democracy in a free market system such as ours, it is not good because we have the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. Not because the rich are doing anything bad. I am not saying they are at fault. 
   What is happening relative to the wealth being generated in America, people without wealth are getting poorer. Raising the minimum wage and expanding the EATC--both of which I favor--do not address the problem of wealth. That is income. In order to address wealth, we have to do it in a different fashion. 
   I hope during this estate tax debate we not only notice that only 2 percent have estates over $650,000, but 98 percent don't, and we begin in an urgent and serious fashion to address that problem.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, a few weeks ago the Senate convened a joint meeting between Democrats and Republicans to receive a classified nuclear briefing from the Department of Defense. The purpose of this bipartisan meeting was for the members of the Senate to get a better understanding of our strategic nuclear weapons policy. 
   Our briefers, which included Admiral Richard Mies, Commander of STRATCOM, had been invited to the Senate to explain the details of the Single Integrated Operational Plan--or SIOP. The SIOP is the highly-classified nuclear blueprint of targets and targeting assignments for our strategic nuclear weapons arsenal, and is the driving force behind our strategic nuclear force levels. While the SIOP is a military document, it is based on guidance given to the Department of Defense by the President. 
   As elected representatives of the people, and with a Constitutional role in determining national security policy, Congress should have an understanding of the principles underpinning our nuclear policy. Both the guidance provided by the President and the details of the SIOP are necessary for us to make informed national security decisions. 
   With this in mind, we gathered in an interior room in the Capitol to get a full briefing on the SIOP. But when we asked the DoD briefers precise questions about the SIOP, we did not get the information we were seeking. The briefers were unable, or unwilling, to give us the kind of specific information about our nuclear forces and plans we need to make the decisions required as elected representatives of the people.  In fact, when asked for detailed targeting information we were given three different answers. First, we were told that they did not bring that kind of information. Then, we were told there were people in the room who were not cleared to receive that kind of information. Finally, we were told that kind of information is only provided to the Senate leadership and members of the Armed Services Committee. Because members of the leadership and the Senate Armed Services Committee indicated they had never received such information, I can only surmise there must be a fourth answer. 
   We find ourselves in an uncomfortable and counter-productive Catch-22. Until we as civilians provide better guidance to our military leaders, we are unlikely to affect the kind of changes needed to update our nuclear policies to reflect the realities of the post-cold-war world. Yet, providing improved guidance is difficult when we are unable to learn the basic components of the SIOP. Given this, I followed up our meeting with a letter to Senate Minority Leader Tom DASCHLE requesting that he schedule another briefing so that we could get the information our first briefers would not provide. 
   While I still believe this briefing is needed, we need not wait for a briefing on the details of the SIOP to answer the question of how many nuclear weapons are needed to deter potential aggressors. In truth, it is important for citizens, armed only with common sense and open-source information, to reach sound conclusions about our nuclear posture and force levels. 
   To illustrate, we should ask experts to describe the deterrent capability of a single Trident submarine--our most survivable and reliable delivery platform. Within an hour of receiving an order to launch, a Trident could deliver and detonate 192 nuclear weapons on their targets. The minimum size of the detonations would 100 kilotons; the maximum would be 300 kilotons. By comparison, the Hiroshima detonation that caused Japan to sue for unconditional peace in August 1945 was only 15 kilotons. In the open, we should assess what damage 192 of these weapons would cause and determine whether this would deter most, if not all of the threats we face. 
   Mr. President, I have made no secret of my strongly-held belief that we can and we should make dramatic reductions in our strategic nuclear arsenals. I believe that by keeping such a large arsenal of strategic nuclear weapons we are decreasing rather than enhancing our security. By keeping such a large arsenal we are forcing the Russians to keep more weapons than they can safely control. By keeping such a large arsenal we are increasing the chance of accidental or unauthorized launch. By keeping such a large arsenal we are increasing the likelihood of the proliferation of these weapons. By keeping such a large arsenal we are encouraging nations like India, Pakistan, Iran, and North Korea to pursue a nuclear weapons option. And finally, by keeping such a large arsenal we are diverting budgetary resources away from our conventional forces--the forces that are vital to protecting our interests around the globe. 
   In the near future, I will return to the Senate floor to discuss this issue further. I will return with non-classified information--information that comes not from briefings in secret rooms, but information all citizens can access through a simple search on Yahoo--in an attempt to better understand our nuclear policy and the changing definition of deterrence in the post-Cold War world. 
   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I want to take a minute, hopefully for the purpose of influencing the conferees on a vote that was taken yesterday--it passed overwhelmingly--having to do with military retiree benefits. 
   There are two amendments, one offered by Senator WARNER, one offered by Senator JOHNSON. I appreciate the intent of both amendments and I appreciate very much, as well, the concerns both Senators and everybody who voted for both of those amendments have for military retirees, especially as far as it might improve our capacity to recruit and retain people in the Armed Forces. I think it is a legitimate concern, and I appreciate very much that concern being expressed yesterday, especially being expressed with affirmative votes, although, as I said, I voted against both of those amendments. 
   I did not, during the debate yesterday, offer the reasons I voted against it, and I want to do that now. Both amendments are essentially dealing with the same situation; that is, once you reach the age of 65, you go off the TRICARE system and you go onto Medicare, as most individuals do who work for other businesses as well who end up with health care. It is not unusual today for people to leave employment to go onto Medicare after their retirement from employment. 
   But one amendment would allow people to buy into TRICARE; Senator JOHNSON's amendment would allow them to buy as well into the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program with a full taxpayer-paid subsidy; one was $4.5 billion a year, the other was about $5.5 billion a year. Senator WARNER's, in order to be 
   able to get it in the budget, has it sunsetting after 2 years. It only goes for 2 years. I presume if it becomes law, we will have to extend it every couple of years. 
   There is a budget issue here that causes me to vote no. The budget issue has to do, first of all, with I think an inadequate amount of study given to who needs this and who does not need this. It was developed fairly quickly. It was offered fairly quickly. I think it should have been examined much more carefully, what the impact was going to be, what the real need is, what the real demand is out there; especially the second concern I have, which is that it adds to one of the biggest problems we have with our current budget, and that is the growing share of our budget that is going over to mandatory spending. 
   The checkpoint for Senator JOHNSON's amendment was people who were enlisted prior to 1957. In 1957, over 70 percent of our budget was appropriated; 70 percent of our budget went to such things as the GI bill and other kinds of investments. I benefited enormously from those investments, not just as a veteran myself, but it was most important for my own parents' generation. That is what they were doing. They were endowing their future. They were really investing in their future as a consequence of those appropriations. 
   This year, 66 percent of the budget is mandatory. This amendment that was put on the Defense authorization bill will make that problem worse. I could not in good faith vote for the amendment as a consequence of those two concerns, even though I recognize for some veterans, some employees, this is a problem. 
   Also, I want to comment on some of the things that were said during the debate. I want to comment, especially from the point of view of myself because I am military retired. I am one of the retirees who would benefit from this change in the law. I am service-connected disabled as a result of an injury in the war in Vietnam, and I have been receiving a military retirement check since I left the Navy in 1969. 
   I understand the recruiting difficulties. I understand we have to be competitive with the private sector. I understand we have a volunteer service today, and so forth. I think it has all been very well said. But focusing on money in this debate, we underestimate and underemphasize the importance of people joining our service because they are patriotic, because they love their country, because they want to serve their country in some meaningful way, because they believe service makes them better, they believe putting themselves on the line for somebody else isn't something that is just good for the other person, it is good for them as well. That was the benefit for me in my service. 
   Though I appreciate very much people coming and saying my country owes me something, I reject that idea. My country owes me nothing. If the Congress of this Nation wants to provide me with retirement, wants to provide me with medical assistance--they provided me with the GI bill and COLAs all these years--they have given me enormous benefits. They gave me a hospital I could go to, to get my care. I appreciate all that. I am grateful for all that. It makes me more patriotic than I was before. 
   But I do not believe as a consequence of my service that the people of the United States of America owe me anything. I want to make that point because I entered the service because it was my duty. I entered the service because I believed it was the right thing to do. I entered the service because I thought 
   I was going to get something intangible out of it--and I did. I learned how to lead, learned how to take responsibility, learned how to do lots of things. And I learned as well what it is like to be injured, what it is like to be injured in a nation that takes care of its veterans, that provides care. I learned what it is to suffer a little bit and to feel compassion for other people as they go through their lives and suffer as a consequence of things that were unforeseen, unexpected, unanticipated, and unavoidable. 
   I have talked to a lot of colleagues on the floor during this debate. They said: Oh, gosh, we can't say no to our veterans, can't say no to our military retirees. 
   There are times we can. I believe, especially when we think about the budget impact that these amendments are going to have, there are times when we should. I do not believe we should fall into the trap of believing that men and women will not still join the Armed Forces of the United States of America because they love this country and they want to serve. 
   Yes, we need to have good pensions. Yes, we need to make certain they are not getting food stamps. Yes, we need to take care of them when they are in. But let them serve as a consequence of feeling loyal, feeling good about their country, and wanting to put themselves on the line. Let service, all by itself, be one of the motivating factors, be one of the reasons that men and women do it. And be grateful for that and reward it, applaud it, pay attention to it. 
   I wish, in fact, people in Hollywood as they make decisions about what they are going to put on television, what they are going to put in movie theaters, told more of the stories of the men and women who are serving today not because they are being paid well, not because there are health care benefits promised, not because of a retirement program waiting for them, but because they love their country, because they feel a patriotic desire to serve the United States of America, serve the people of the United States of America and the cause of freedom for which we stand. 
   It is not a cliche; it is a real thing. I am concerned, concerned with some of the debate I heard yesterday, that only the pecuniary interests were involved; that all we had to do was get the pay high enough, retirement benefits high enough, health care benefits high enough, and we would solve all of our problems. 
   We will not solve all of our problems if that is what we do. If we do not recognize that one of the reasons people serve is that they love their country, A, we will find ourselves falling short of recruitment and retention objectives, but, in addition to that, we will not know when the correct time is to say to that man or woman who served their country: We have to make certain we have enough money in our budget to invest in our children and their future as well. 
   We cannot, as we are doing, simply put more and more money in people over the age of 65. I love them. They  have served their country. They are the greatest generation ever. But this action comes on top of eliminating the earnings test, which was a $22 billion proposal over 10. I voted for that. There were 100 of us on this floor who voted for that. It was a reasonable thing to do. But if you look at the diminishing amount of money we invest every single year through our appropriations accounts, and you look at that trend continuing to go further and further down, it gets harder and harder to say we are endowing our future the way our parents endowed the future for us. 
   Mr. President, I did not want anybody to suffer the illusion that I do not care about our military retirees. I do. There were good fiscal reasons why not to support the amendment, but I hope as we go into conference we do not get lulled into thinking the only thing we have to do to recruit and retain people in our Armed Forces is to provide some pecuniary reimbursement that enables them to feel they are getting rewarded in some way that is competitive with what they can get in the marketplace. I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments. There is no question that should be a very big concern of the conferees because Senator WARNER yesterday, when we were debating this issue, expressed his understanding that this would increase the requirement to build additional military hospitals and military health care facilities. This will shift the burden of paying for health care from Medicare over to the Defense budget. 
   There is no question that is the case. I say to the Senator, I remember talking to my recruiter very well. I remember the day I sat in front of a Navy recruiter and he said to me: Join the Navy; see the world. He made all kinds of promises to me. I have not sued my Government because they did not give me a chance to see the world. 
   I believe the Senator is right. There were some legitimate written promises made, and if there were legitimate written promises that were made, then we ought to make certain we keep those commitments. 
   Sometimes it becomes much more a political rhetoric than it becomes reality. I do think, whether it is a veteran or whether it is some other American, one of the hardest things for us to do when somebody asks us for something is to say no. The Senator from Alaska has had to do that many times in his career in the Senate. ``I want some of the taxpayers' money to do something'' and the Senator has had to repeatedly say no. 
   It is not easy to do that. It is too easy for us to get caught up, when we talk about making sure we take care of our retirees, in the feeling that you just cannot say no. 
   I argue that the answer is you can say no, and there are times you need to say no. If you do not say no, it is going to be difficult for us to keep our force modernized and weapons systems modernized and our people who are in the services well paid. 
   Again, I say to my friend, the thing I fear--and I will say it directly--is we have a declining number of people who have been in the services in the Congress. I am very much aware it is easy to say: Gee, I have to do this; I wasn't in the service, I have to do this. 
   I had to say I did not join the Navy because they promised me health care benefits, retirement benefits, and promised me I could go to school on the GI bill. That was not the contract. It was all there. 
   People say: We owe you. No. I have a bigger debt to my country than my country has to me. It is a very important attitude for us to instill not just in our young people but retirees as well. We have to be very careful that in doing something we do not undercut the most important reason men and women come into the Armed Forces. We ought to praise them. We ought to recognize that and not forget it is still a very big reason people serve.

    Mr. KERREY. 
   Mr. President, one year ago I came to the floor of the United States Senate to introduce legislation designed to improve the environmental quality and public use and appreciation of the Missouri River. The Missouri River Valley Improvement Act of 1999, sought to also mark the upcoming bicentennial anniversary of the Lewis and Clark expeditions of this great river. At that time I asked my colleagues who represent the states and communities along the Missouri River to look closely at the bill and join me as cosponsors in support of the legislation. 
   Through the hard work of state officials, river organizations and citizens throughout the Missouri River basin, many important improvements have been made to this bill. I believe these improvements strengthens our commitment to protecting the Missouri River. I am pleased, therefore, to introduce today, along with my Colleague's Senator DASCHLE, Senator BOND, Senator JOHNSON, Senator BROWNBACK and Senator ROBERTS, the Missouri River Valley Improvement Act of 2000. 
   This legislation maintains the commitment made in last year's bill to aid native river fish and wildlife, reduce flood loss, and enhance recreation and tourism throughout the basin. Additionally, this bill provides authorities for the revitalization of historic riverfronts, similar to the ongoing `Back to the River' revitalization project currently underway in my home state of Nebraska. The new legislation also recognizes the commitment Congress made last year to habitat restoration efforts along the Missouri River by authorizing resources for these projects. 
   I am proud of the bipartisan support garnered for this legislation. This bill demonstrates that common ground exists when it comes to strengthening the health of the Missouri River. Those who use the river whether it be for recreational, commercial, or environmental purposes recognize the benefits of preserving this National treasure. Protecting native habitat along the Missouri River and enhancing environmental understanding through riverfront restoration and scientific monitoring is a legacy we should all want to leave our children and grandchildren. 
   Mr. President, it is my hope that this bill becomes part of the growing recognition that the environmental revitalization of the Missouri River is in all of our interests. The Missouri River Valley Improvement Act of 2000 will help to restore and improve our access and enjoyment of the river, and will provide vital economic, recreational and education opportunities for everyone who lives along and visits this great river, the Crown Jewel of the Midwest.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, if I could make a comment on that subject, very much a part of this effort to try to find a compromise on this memorial, in the beginning I opposed the design and they redesigned it. I am very pleased now to be able to support both the design and construction. 
   One of the things, I say to my friend from Virginia, that happened during this process was that there was a deletion made from this design that I think at some point needs to be corrected --not on this site because its too small a site to accommodate it--and that is the construction of a museum that tells the full story. And I think it has relevance, in fact, to the debate on this bill because when George Marshall accepted Roosevelt's appointment to be Chief of Staff of the Army on September 1, 1939, the Armed Forces of the United States of America were approximately 137,000 people. 
   Marshall had to build the Army to 8 million people in order for it to be an effective fighting force, and it wasn't just the military people who responded. There was a huge civilian effort that supported that buildup. It is a story of how dangerous it is, even though you may not see an enemy on the horizon at the moment, how dangerous it is to stack arms for the United States of America. 
   We had a resolution a couple of years ago, I think, on this bill to try to allocate the resources and do the study to build. There were a number of terrific places in the Senator's State right across the river that were cited. I believe this will be a wonderful memorial, but the missing piece is to tell the full story of what happened from Versailles all the way through the Second World War. There was basically an interruption for 20 years while America tried to withdraw one more time from the world. We paid a terrible price for it. I appreciate very much the Senator's willingness to allocate the money for this.

   Mr. KERREY. I know that site fairly well. I think it would be a terrific site for history of the Armed Forces, but I also believe oftentimes the most important decisions aren't the decisions the military is making but that the civilians made prior to the military having to act, at least as I see the history. 
   In the Second World War, there were an awful lot of mistakes made in the 1920s and the 1930s that created the necessity for that terrible war. It is a very important reminder, especially today. It is something I am asked all the time when debating authorization for the military. 
   People say: Do we need it? Who is the enemy? We are spending more than 20 leading nations, et cetera, et cetera. 
   People say: Why do we need to continue to do this? The cold war is over, and so forth. 
   The best answer lies in that 20-year period between 1919 and 1939 during which the United States of America tried, in the face of all evidence to the contrary, to stack arms and withdraw and become isolationist. 
   We have talked long enough on that subject. I appreciate very much the Senator responding to former Senator Dole's request. This is the minimum that the people of the United States of America ought to do to participate in constructing this important memorial.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the amendment before the Senate now presents to Members of the Senate a series of questions that we have to answer. 
   The first is, Should the Congress, under any circumstances, impose a limitation on the Commander in Chief? As it says, the Commander in Chief can't go below a certain level of strategic nuclear weapons. We imposed this for the first time in 1998. One of the strongest arguments made in 1998 and 1999 was that we needed that in order to put pressure on the Duma to ratify START II. They have now ratified START II. I think it is unwise to impose a limitation. Whether the President is a Democrat, whether the President is a Republican, I think it limits that President's ability to be able to negotiate. As a consequence, it puts the President in a weaker position when he is talking, whether to Russia or other nations--it puts that President in a weaker position and gives him less maneuverability to be able to protect the people of the United States. If we don't like the action a President takes, the Congress can intervene to act. That is question No. 1.  
   Do you think, under any circumstances that you can describe, we ought to pass a law that says a President cannot go below a certain level? In this case, the START I level is not only 6,000 warheads, but as the Senator from Arizona indicated earlier, we describe in the law the precise platform delivery systems for the warheads.

   Mr. KERREY. I am pleased to do that. 
   The first question is, Did the Congress do the right thing in 1998 and 1999, and would we be doing the right thing today or in the future to have a statute that imposes upon a President a floor, a limitation, under which that President cannot go as a consequence of our deciding that should only occur as we described in this law? 
   We did it in 1998 and again in 1999 and we are proposing to do it again this year.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, first, Congress should be making a decision based upon what we think is right. We oftentimes pass defense authorization bills that have things the President doesn't like. My guess is that the Senator from Virginia has urged the President on many occasions: I understand, Mr. President, you don't like this particular provision, but I urge you to sign it anyway. There are many other good things in the bill. Mr. President, we hope you will sign it because we can't get it any better. 
   That happens all the time here. 
   So the fact that the President signed it does not mean the President concurs. Nor should it cause a Senator to say, just because the President signed it, that doesn't mean it is a good act. We disagree with the President all the time around here. We will get behind him when we like what he is doing, and we will get out in front of him when we do not like what he is doing. That is the appropriate way, I suspect, it ought to be done. Members of the Senate should be deciding: Do we think it is a wise thing? Do we want to restrict future President Bush or future President GORE? It is not accidental that was imposed in 1996. It has not been imposed on previous Presidents. It has been imposed only on this particular President. So whether the President signs the bill or not, in my view, is secondary to the question: Do you think it is a sound policy? 
   In a post-cold-war era where we have had three Presidential elections in Russia--and understand, the bulk of our strategic weapons system is for Russia. That is the bulk of our system. What would the Senator say, 75 percent or 80 percent of the SIOP is dealing with the democratic nation of Russia with whom we have relations, with whom we are trying to work to help to be successful in their democratic experiment and their experiment with free markets? The question is, Does it restrict the President and make it less likely he can begin to think in a new way--which, in my judgment, needs to occur? 
   So, regardless, whether the President signs it or not, my guess is the President does not support this provision. But even if he said, ``I support it,'' I would still oppose it. I still think it is unreasonable for Congress to do. So that is question No. 1 that you have to decide. Whether the President signs it or not is secondary. My guess is a lot of folks on that side of the aisle think the President signs a lot of things they wish he would not sign, things they voted against. So it is not, to me, a very compelling argument to say we have to do this because the President signed five previous bills that had this provision in them.

   The administration appreciates the bill's endorsement of our plan to reduce the Trident submarine force from 18 to 14 boats, while maintaining a survivable, effective START I-capable force. However, we prefer repealing the general provision that maintains the prohibition, first enacted in the FY 1998 Defense Authorization Act, against obligating funds to retire or dismantle any other strategic nuclear delivery systems below specified levels.......  
   And on and on and on. 
   So the President has signed it, but the President does not support this policy. Again, I do not suppose that is going to be persuasive to my colleague, but he used an argument against repealing this provision that said the President supports it, or he signed the bill which implies that he supports the provision. 
   I personally believe the Congress should be making the decision. The Senator's argument, with great passion, that he does not like infringing upon the prerogatives of the President--I have heard him many times down here arguing, oftentimes against Members of his own party, against efforts to do that. So I am surprised, in fact, especially now that the Russian Duma has ratified START II, that we  want to continue this policy. I think it is not good. So that is question No. 1. You have heard very eloquent argument on the other side. Question No. 1 is: Does Congress want to do that under any circumstances with or without a review? 
   The second question we are now going to be asked, as a consequence of the second-degree amendment, is: Do we want to delay action? Do we want to restrict the action in accordance with the second-degree amendment which basically says we have to have a nuclear force structure review and that review is submitted concurrently with the quadrennial review which is expected December of 2001? 
   I believe it is time for the people's representatives, elected by the people, to be having a debate about what kind of force structure we want to maintain. And it is counterproductive, it is difficult for us to reach the right decision, if we once again farm it off and say we want somebody else to figure it out. It is the civilians who send instructions to the CINC at STRATCOM. It is PDD-60 that determines what the Single Integrated Operating Plan, the SIOP, is. The targets are selected as a consequence of civilian instructions, not the other way around. It is we who have to decide, Do we have enough? Do we have too much? Or is it right? It is we who have to bring commonsense analysis to the debate and answer the question: Given the current status, given what we expect out in the future, do we have enough? 
   We have the statements of General Shalikashvili in 1995, as he evaluated this, that seem to indicate that lower levels are safe. But even there, General Shalikashvili is following civilian instructions. 
   I understand this amendment provides people an opportunity to sort of vote for this thing and we are going to have a normal review. It may in fact carry the day. It is a very complicated argument, and it may in fact be that the second-degree amendment passes. I hope not, because it is time for this Congress to take back the responsibility for targeting and answer the question: Do we have enough, do we have too little, or do we have the numbers quite right? 
   I urge Members to look at what we now have in the public realm, data that indicates what that targeting is. We have an analysis, public analysis now, of what happens when we have 2,500 strategic warheads after we subtract that fraction that may not be available to us for a variety of reasons. Understanding we are not shooting bullets here, these are very complicated systems, and you cannot, with 100-percent reliability, predict that they are going to arrive on target in 
   the manner that has been described. So they are very complicated systems. It requires modernization; it requires constant analysis. The men and women at STRATCOM and others who have that responsibility are highly skilled, and they work on that problem all the time. 
   This is why I think the review is not a good idea. It pushes away from us one more time the problem of just considering what these nuclear weapons can do instead of asking ourselves, with a commonsense analysis--because, again, the targeting begins with civilian instructions. It is the Presidential directive that determines what the targeting is. We have modified the targeting, certainly, to accommodate some of the changes that have occurred as a result of the end of the cold war. But I believe if you look at these things and say, oh, my gosh, what will those do, you will reach a commonsense conclusion that we have more than is necessary in order to keep the people of the United States of America safe. 
   That is the mission of this defense authorization bill, whether we are debating the pay for our military, whether we are debating our force structure, or readiness, whatever it is. We ought to authorize and we ought to appropriate such funds as necessary to keep the people of the United States of America and our interests and our allies safe. That is what our mission is. 
   But, again, on the question of the need for review, what is needed is for Congress to review it, for Congress to answer the question. We have, under what is called the minimal deterrent level, the 2,500 warheads: We have 500 100- to 300-kiloton weapons that will land on war-supporting installations in Russia, 160 on leadership, 500 on conventional forces, 1,100 on nuclear targets. 
   I urge, rather than doing a review, what we need to do is bring out a map of Russia and take a look and answer the question, What do 2,260 nuclear detonations of a minimum of 100 kilotons do to Russia? Remember, the war in the Pacific ended in 1945 as a consequence of two 15-kiloton detonations. I stipulated earlier my uncle died in the Philippines and my father was a part of the occupation force rather than invasion. I have a vested interest in declaring that I think Truman did the right thing. But those were two 15-kiloton detonations. We are talking about 2,260 detonations in excess of 100 kilotons. We do not need a review by professionals. The people's representatives need to do an analysis of this, and I urge my colleagues to do that kind of analysis. Imagine those kinds of detonations and ask yourself, Do we have enough? 
   Connected with that, do an analysis yourself, both of the command and control capability of Russia and of their ability to do warnings, because if they have mistakes made at either command and control or warning--and their capacity to do early warning not only is declining but it is declining enough so the President, in one of the few successes he had, in addition to getting an agreement to eliminate weapons-grade plutonium, got an agreement to do a joint warning center in Moscow because the analysis says their capacity to do accurate warning is declining. What does that mean? It means if they get a false alarm, they are going to launch because their instructions are to launch on warning. 
   So what we are doing is, as a consequence of maintaining higher levels pending more reviews, et cetera, et cetera, we are forcing the Russians to maintain a level higher than they are able to maintain, putting us at risk. It increases the risk today. That is how the end of the cold war has changed things. Russia cannot maintain 6,000 strategic weapons. They have been begging us for years. Indeed, one of the things I said yesterday, one of the paradoxes of this whole debate, is I am not sure this administration would take action.

   Mr. KERREY. I appreciate that response. I made it clear in questions yesterday posed to the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Colorado having to do with the issue of whether or not this action could be taken prior to December of 1991, whether or not an accelerated comprehensive review could occur if it was a President Bush or a President GORE. The answer was yes, leading me to say in that situation maybe I would support the amendment because if they can do an accelerated review, so can President Clinton. 
   The answer then came back: No, we do not want President Clinton to do an accelerated view. We are willing to let President GORE or President Bush do it but not President Clinton. That is precisely why it is a bad provision because I believe it is there because of distrust of a single President. It is not wise, in my judgment, for the Congress to impose that kind of restriction because it does send a signal to our allies not to negotiate. 
   It makes it much more difficult for the President to negotiate not only arms control agreements but to take action as President Bush did in 1991 facing a problem of how do we leapfrog the arms control process. 
   I heard my colleagues on the other side say the old arms control process needs to be torn up. That is not inconsistent with this kind of thinking. That is exactly what Governor Bush said in his press club speech surrounded by Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Brent Scowcroft, and Colin Powell. If those four 
   men were part of that new administration and they came out and said we need a review in November, December, and January and we think we can go to lower levels and we want to go immediately, we can get Russia to agree to a robust missile defense, my guess is every single Member of the other side would go along with it immediately, understanding these men are qualified and they understand what is necessary to protect the United States of America. 
   They do not need another review, and they certainly do not need Congress imposing a limitation on where they can go. This is a limitation that has been imposed on a single President. If it becomes policy for Congress to do it, I believe it is going to be very difficult for us to take advantage of this new post-cold-war opportunity, as the other side has done repeatedly. There are times when the President submits a budget for defense and they say it is not enough. They do not say we need a review of this for another 3 or 4 months or a long period of time. They say we have done a review; we are not ready so we have to put more money in the budget, we have to put more weapons systems in the budget that were not in the President's request. 
   We do not have any difficulty confronting the President. We do not ask for reviews when the President is not asking us to do something we want. This is, in my judgment, a provision that was put in here as a consequence of not trusting a particular President, and it is a mistake. It is going to hamstring the next President, whoever that President is. This amendment attempts to soften it a bit, but it still leaves it in place. Senator KYL, I understand, was speaking for how they now interpret the amendment, saying, no, the review has to be submitted concurrently with a quadrennial review whenever that occurs. Maybe it is not in December 2001. Maybe it is done in January 2002. What if you have a President Bush coming online with Secretary of Defense Colin Powell and George Shultz and Brent Scowcroft and Henry Kissinger as part of that administration, and they do a review in November and December and come to you and say: We decided we want to go to 5,000 in exchange for an agreement; is that sufficient?

   Mr. KERREY. I am not implying a political motivation. I am rereading your answers to my questions yesterday. I saw reason I would support this amendment, and the reason I could have supported the amendment is, if you had said to me, yes, a thoughtful and thorough review can be done by civilians in less time than done by a quadrennial review that would allow President Bush or President GORE, and the answer was that would be acceptable. I then said: What if Clinton did the same thing? The answer was no. I am reading back and remembering what the exchange was yesterday.

   Mr. KERREY. The question the Senator from Virginia asked me was, Why did the President send up an authorization request for current levels if he was thinking about going lower? That is a good question. I am not certain the President would use his authority. The question that provokes is, Why, if the President is asking for existing levels, are this Senator from Virginia and others so concerned that he might go lower? Why do we have this prohibition on any President? It is an unnecessary and unwarranted interference, and it makes the people of the United States of America an awful lot less safe, given what is going on in Russia today.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, in 1968 I had the good fortune, or misfortune, to be given the chance to go down to Fort Benning and go through Army Ranger School. We had a little joke that was keying in on a line from a John Wayne movie. We looked out in the darkness and said: It sure is quiet out there. Somebody else would come back with a punchline: Too quiet. 
   That is precisely my instinct when it comes to strategic nuclear weapons. There is a real danger. For some reason, we understand the danger if it is North Korea maybe getting nuclear weapons or Iraq maybe getting nuclear weapons or Iran maybe getting nuclear weapons. 
   Russia has 7,000 strategic nuclear weapons and 12,000 tactical. These are not inaccurate, unreliable systems. These are very accurate, reliable, and deadly systems. They have more than they need, and we have more than we need. Instead of pressing the President to go to lower levels, the current language of law and this amendment says we want further delay; we want to push the President in the opposite direction. We are pushing this President in the wrong way. We should be pushing the President to go to lower levels because it keeps America safe if we do. 
   Why does it keep America safe? Not only is it sort of odd to be negotiating with Putin on all sorts of things at the same time that we have 160 nuclear weapons aimed at Russian leadership, but in addition, the Russian economy simply doesn't generate enough income to enable them to be able to sustain the investments necessary to control their community system and most importantly, their warning system. 
   So what happens? We are pushing the President to go slow, we are asking for more studies. 
   Mr. President, we don't need more studies. We can make this debate about more and more studies, but for gosh sakes, this is one subject on which we don't need more studies. This has been examined up one side and down the other. We have studies coming out the wazoo. We need decisions. Looking at the current situation, one can reach no other conclusion than that we are requiring the Russians, as a consequence of current law, to maintain a level beyond what they can safely control, increasing the risk far beyond the risk of rogue nations such as Iraq or Iran or North Korea, far beyond that. If there is an accidental or unauthorized launch that occurs as a consequence of a mistake made because of a warning failure, they are not going to send a couple. It will be a couple hundred or a couple thousand. 
   I smell danger. I am glad we have had this debate, but we are pushing the President in the wrong direction both with the amendment of the Senator from Virginia and the existing law. I hope that enough colleagues on the other side of the aisle have listened to this debate and will vote against the Warner amendment. I believe quite seriously that it increases the risk to the people of the United States of America.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, with great respect to the Senator from Virginia, both the underlying law and his amendment push the President in the wrong direction. Both Russia and the United States have more nuclear weapons than we need. This has been studied to death. There are plenty of studies, plenty of reviews, plenty of evaluation. Gov. George W. Bush, with Henry Kissinger, with George Shultz, with Brent Scowcroft, and with Colin Powell, has it right. It requires new thinking. We will not only be pushing President Clinton in the wrong direction, but if Governor Bush wins, we push him in the wrong direction. We are forcing the Russians to maintain nuclear weapons in excess of what they can control. As a consequence, we are increasing the risk, threat, and danger to the people of the United States of America. 
   I urge my colleagues, in as strong a language as possible, to vote against the Warner amendment.

<DOCNO>106-kerrey-ne-4-20000606</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, in 1998, the Congress, for the first time in the history of strategic nuclear weapons policy, imposed upon a President a limitation on what that President could do in terms of reducing nuclear weapons. It imposed a floor at the START I levels, which is roughly 6,000 strategic nuclear weapons. It said the President could not go below 6,000, unless and until the Duma ratified START II. 
   Last year, when I attempted to eliminate this restriction--which I believe is putting a position upon an Executive that would be very difficult to sustain if we were discussing this in the clear light of day, if it was understood by the American people that this was what we were doing--many people on that side of the aisle said: We believe this language will put pressure upon the Duma to ratify START II. The argument carried the day in a close vote of 54-46; the current policy was sustained. The language in the current law is section 1302 of the National Defense Authorization Act. It references that section 1017 of this particular legislation we are considering right now was held in law. 
   Well, since that time, the Duma has ratified START II. I expected to bring this language to the floor this year with open arms. It worked. We put in a floor and said the United States could not go any lower, declared victory, and the Duma ratified START II. Instead, we have an alternative proposal the Senator from Virginia has offered that has a certain amount of appeal because it requires a strategic review of our nuclear force structure. After that review, it gives the President authority, subject to what the review says, to waive the provisions of 1302 if the President says it is in the national security interest to do so. 
   It still puts us in a position--whether it is President Clinton or, if Vice President GORE wins the election, President GORE or, if Governor Bush wins, President Bush--the President will be prevented by Congress from reducing nuclear weapons below the START I levels, below 6,000, unless the President of the United States can accelerate a strategic review. I guess that is possible. I would like to find out from the authors of this second degree if that is their understanding. In other words,  could President Clinton satisfy the requirements of this amendment by saying: My Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Energy are going to do an accelerated review? 
   This language has to be concurrent with the quadrennial review and submitted no later than December 2001. Could the President accelerate that review on this particular question? If not, whoever the next President is, they are going to be held up at least until December of 2001 from doing so. That makes complete sense for America to do, in my judgment. 
   One of the most compelling things that happened on this subject prior to our leaving for our Memorial Day recess was a remarkable speech given by the likely Republican nominee for President, Governor Bush, followed by a speech at the Naval Academy given by Vice President GORE, the likely Democratic nominee for President. The comments, which I found to be very striking and very encouraging, indicate a significant shift in our policy if the Republican nominee has any influence over the Republican Party platform. 
   Governor George Bush, surrounded by the preeminent thinkers on the Republican side on nuclear strategy--former National 
   Security Chief Brent Scowcroft, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Colin Powell, former Secretary of State George Shultz, and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger--they were all there standing with Governor Bush as he said the following:  
   America should rethink the requirements for nuclear deterrence in a new security environment. The premise of the Cold War nuclear targeting should no longer dictate the size of our arsenal. As President, I will ask the Secretary of Defense to conduct an assessment of our nuclear force posture and determine how best to meet our security needs. While the exact number of weapons can only come from such assessment, I will pursue the lowest possible numbers consistent with our national security.  
   If Governor Bush were President today, he would not think very kindly of Congress coming along and saying: We don't think you have been in office long enough; 9 years is not long enough, so we are going to ask you to do an additional review before you do what you say you are going to do here. It is an interference on the part of Congress at a time, in my view, that the President ought to be doing exactly what Governor Bush is suggesting; that is, to break out of the Cold War thinking, and has us saying we have to maintain our parity with the Russians; otherwise, it is not going to be possible to get the kind of arms control agreements we want to get. 
   I must say, I find much to be commended in many things I have heard on the other side of the aisle having to do with missile defense, believing that in an era when we begin to reduce nuclear weapons, accidental and unauthorized launches from rogue nations, or the threat of them, are likely to increase as we draw down our nuclear forces. Missile defense becomes, in my judgment at least, an even more compelling part of our arsenal. 
   Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Alaska.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, it is somewhat difficult to get back to the somewhat arcane subject of how many nuclear weapons are needed after listening to the recitation of the Senator from Alaska of a short, very moving statement that in many ways gets to the heart of the mood we ought to be in when we are discussing our defense authorization bill, which is not just trying to answer the question how we authorize and defend the United States of America but how we give honor to those who have given the highest and most in service to this country. 
   I appreciate very much the presentation by the Senator from Alaska of that memorial because I think it puts us indeed in the correct mood, which is, we ought to be writing this law so as to enable all of us to take action to defend the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic, without regard to some previous ideology that we have held onto for a long time. 
   We ought to do the right thing and not worry about whether or not we are going to find ourselves subject to criticism as a consequence of some group saying we didn't do enough, or we have done too much, and so on and so forth. It is that kind of thinking that is required if we are going to get the right number of nuclear weapons. We spend $15 billion to $20 billion a year on our nuclear weapons force structure. It is an oppressive effort. 
   I happen to have the privilege of not just serving the people of the State of Nebraska but in the State of Nebraska is an effort and an organization known as STRATCOM. STRATCOM's entire mission is to operate the strategic nuclear force. The current STRATCOM CINC and I have a very good relationship, as I have with all other CINCs, because this mission is very important to the people of the State of Nebraska and to the people of the United States of America. I have had the opportunity on many occasions to be briefed, and I can state to my colleagues that we get our money's worth. These men and women work very hard. They are tireless in the execution of their duties. They want to make certain they follow the command and the orders that are given by the people's leaders--in this case, the Commander in Chief--who instruct STRATCOM on what to do through a Presidential directive. They are following orders. 
   They put together target requirements. They put together a list of requirements that are called SIOP. SIOP determines what targeting is being done. Then it comes back to us, and it says this is what we need in order to follow the civilian orders. They come to us and say these are the resources we need in order to be able to accomplish that objective. 
   It is very important for us to follow that because often times it will turn to the military. We turn to the STRATCOM and say such things as: Tell us the minimum level of deterrence. They come back and say: The minimum level is 2,500. We have to have 2,500 warheads. 
   Remember, that 2,500 number comes as a consequence of an order they have been given by a Presidential directive. They have been given an order. That is where it comes from. Change those requirements and the number of warheads is going to be changed. It may be that a Presidential directive comes and says we need more. I do not know. But right now, without the lengthy review--I appreciate the lengthy force structure review that is in this authorization. That is basically the substitute--that we have a lengthy review that is going to be 
   done. 
   I urge my colleagues to think of several things. 
   One, the Russians, first of all, are no longer the military threat they were in the cold war. It is a democratic nation. They have had three elections. They just elected their second President. We have partnerships with them in many different areas. We want their experiment in democracy and free markets to succeed. 
   The chairman of the Armed Services Committee said earlier he believes the No. 1 threat to the United States of  America is political instability. It is uniquely the case. In Russia, that is the case. Our mood toward the Russians ought to be that we want to partner with them and help them be successful in making this transition from an economy run by a central government--a Politburo--to a political system that is not limited to a single party but one that has selected its leadership. They are trying to make a successful transition. They need the partnership and they need the assistance of the world's leading democracy to make that likely to occur. 
   No. 1, we are dealing with a dramatically different political situation. This is not the Soviet Union. It is Russia we are talking about. 
   No. 2, everybody who assesses Russia right now understands that as a consequence of the catastrophic failure of the Communist economic system, and as a consequence of a number of other things associated with the decisions made by their political leaders, they have barely enough money to be able to make payroll for a dramatically reduced military, let alone be able to allocate the resources--though they are modernizing in certain areas--and their ability to provide the early warning that is necessary is woefully deficient and is weakening every single day, leading up to the possibility of increasing the likelihood of a false warning to their leadership. 
   One of the things the President and President Putin agreed on is that we are going to have this site in Russia for the first time. But the Russians are going to be provided data that comes from U.S. computer analysis. They are not going to get it through their own system, or through their own overhead system, or through their own electronic surveillance; they are going to get it from us. 
   It is likely to give them slightly more confidence. But it is not going to give them the kind of confidence that is necessary when decisions have to be made very rapidly not to put a launch against the United States even though the warning they get may be a false warning. 
   The second thing colleagues need to understand as we think about imposing--that was a fundamental change in 1998--for the first time on the President that ``thou'' cannot go below the START I agreements, even though President Bush did it very successfully in 1991, is that we were not going to allow this President to do it in last year's debate. It was because we were putting pressure on the Duma to ratify. This year, it is a different argument that is being used; we are imposing upon the President an unusual and unprecedented restriction at a time when Russia is not able to come up with the resources they need to maintain the level at 6,000. They are begging us to go to 1,500. 
   It may not be in our interest to go to 1,500, but it is unquestionably in our interest to assist them to go to lower levels since they can't maintain the levels they have now. It 
   increases, in a paradoxical fashion, the likelihood of an unauthorized accidental launch and decreases the likely effectiveness, if we are going to have one, of an effective missile defense system because the Russians aren't going to launch 10 or 20. The Russians aren't going to launch a relatively small number of not very accurate missiles, as rogue nations might. They have very highly accurate missile systems and large numbers of them. They would launch in the hundreds, or perhaps in the thousands, based upon a warning that may be inaccurate. 
   We are increasing the risk when we force the President to maintain at a START I level at a time when the Russians are saying we can't afford to maintain at that level and begging us to come to some kind of an agreement that enables them to go to lower levels. 
   The last argument: Again, if you take a commonsense approach to this and just say what the targeting requirements are. 
   A long time ago, or 6 months ago, much of this was classified. But increasing amounts of it are making their way into the public record. 
   It is a very interesting problem because, again, the number of nuclear warheads begins as a consequence of a Presidential directive. It goes to STRATCOM. That Presidential directive is then fairly precise language. But it still doesn't tell the exact number. It gives them a set of instructions that they then follow. They produce what is called a SIOP. That SIOP has been read by a very small number of elected representatives. Very few elected people look at the targeting requirement. 
   Recently, we have seen in published accounts some information which gives us some idea of the size of our capacity and the deadliness of our capacity. 
   I believe as well it is an unwise conclusion that we ought to maintain at our current level. 
   The Russian nuclear target of a 2,500 force structure would be slightly under the START II. START II would take us to 3,000. The Pentagon says we need 2,500 warheads. Again, that is based upon the Pentagon taking the Presidential directive they have been given at 2,500. 
   We have 1,100 nuclear weapons we would put on nuclear sites, 3,500 on conventional weapon sites, 160 on leadership, and 500 nuclear weapons on war-supporting industry. 
   These numbers tend to dull our thinking, making it difficult to assess just what it is we are talking about. 
   Let's reverse it. Say the Russians have targeted American territory with 160 nuclear weapons. They don't have a nuclear weapon in the strategic arsenal that is less than the 15-kiloton weapon dropped on Hiroshima. We dropped two weapons in 1945 that ended the war in the Pacific. We had a vested interest in that. My uncle was killed in the Philippines. My father was part of an occupation, instead of invasion force. I believe Truman did the right thing. Nonetheless, it is impressive that two 15-kiloton weapons ended the war in the Pacific. We are talking about hundreds in this case. 
   Imagine the Russians are only going to hit the United States with 160 nuclear weapons averaging 150 to 300 kilotons each. I don't need a complicated, detailed year-long strategic review to determine that 160 nuclear weapons hitting the United States of America would not just do slight damage; they would cause massive damage to our economy, to our political structures, to our social structures. They would produce monstrous losses to us. 
   Ask Alan Greenspan what it would do to the economy. He seems to be the most trusted person right now in trying to get American people to be concerned about things going on in the world. It would produce tremendous and devastating losses. 
   The same is true with Russia. Mr. President, 160 nuclear weapons inside of Russia would reduce Russia to a state of chaos. It wouldn't just damage their leadership and eliminate their leadership. It would do exactly the opposite, in my view, of what we would desire. It would produce the very political instability and chaos we seek to avoid. As a consequence, it likely would not be selected as an option, thereby producing, again, one of the great paradoxes of maintaining a defense system where we authorize $15 to $20 billion of scarce resources. 
   The chairman of the committee talked earlier about the possible need to allocate additional money for retirees' medical care. There is no question we look across the current conventional forces and we don't have to look far to find a situation where we are flying the wings off the planes. We are having a difficult time sustaining levels of readiness. We are short on the conventional side. At a time when we are short, I don't believe we ought to be expending precious resources into areas that are likely to be unnecessary or that are unlikely to be used. 
   I am arguing the President ought to go to lower levels. The President may disagree with me. In fact, up until now, the President has disagreed with me and hasn't gone to lower levels. That is why I was pleasantly surprised at that part of Governor Bush's speech prior to the Memorial Day recess where he said we ought to scrap the old cold war thinking. I agree. We need to assess what kind of weapons system we need to keep the people of the United States of America safe in light of the new political realities--not in light of the old mutual assured destruction reality, in light of the new political realities. 
   I believe without extensive and expensive nuclear review, we would reach a conclusion of significantly lowering. I don't believe this Congress under any circumstance, whether the President agrees with me or not, should be imposing this kind of restriction. It ties  the President's hands. It limits the President. It forces the President to do something that up 
   until 1998 we had not required the President of the United States of America to do. Again there was an argument last year made that this would get the Duma to ratify START II on that basis. 
   I said earlier to the distinguished Senator from Virginia, I was hoping perhaps my amendment would be accepted, declare victory, and we shake hands and say we had a good argument and there is no need to go further. Indeed, I ask the Senator from Virginia, it may be that what I ought to do is vote for the Senator's substitute, depending on what it is the Senator proposed to do. In this amendment, it appears to be that the President would have the authority to waive the restrictions of 1302 after a comprehensive review was done. However, in the language of the Senator's amendment, it merely says this is supposed to be done concurrently with the quadrennial review and due to operate in 2001. 
   Does the Senator mean, therefore, that President Clinton couldn't ask Secretary Cohen and Secretary Richardson to do an accelerated comprehensive review of the nuclear force structure, and, as a consequence of that review, say perhaps the President says: I want to go to 5500, I want to go below because I think on that basis I could get the Russians to agree to accept changes in ABM that might even be acceptable to the Senator from Virginia --would that sort of accelerated review be possible? It appears it would be in the language of the Senator's amendment.

This is a conventional Army officer who is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. My guess is that was a pretty detailed review. In fact, he came to the conclusion at that time that 2,500 is the minimal level that is necessary.

   Mr. KERREY. That is precisely what section 1302 does. Section 1302 says the President cannot go below the START I levels. For the first time, it restricted and tied the hands of 
   a President in his own decisionmaking about strategic forces. That is what it did. I sought to strike it last year and was told the concern was the Duma might not ratify START II. They have done that. 
   It seems to me the language gives the President, this President--I am asking the question because it affects whether or not I simply just declare victory myself and support your second-degree amendment. If your second-degree amendment gives the President the flexibility to waive, if he says, ``I have already done that review and I will submit to Congress the review that was done by General Shalikashvili in 1997,'' it may be we have agreement here. But if you are saying the intent of the amendment is to say President Clinton, after having been Commander in Chief for 7 years, is not sufficiently prepared to make this decision, we need a further review before he can make it, then I couldn't support the second degree.

   Mr. KERREY. I am anxious to hear the statement. As I said, it may be--expecting that the chairman, the Senator from Virginia, after listening to last year's debate, would merely this year declare victory and allow this provision to be struck, it may be I should declare victory and accept this amendment, if it does not restrict the Commander in Chief who has had plenty of time to review it--and he may not. As I said, up to now he hasn't agreed that going to lower levels in exchange for ABM is a good strategy--and he may not. It may all be moot as far as I know. But if it does not restrict this President, or the incoming President, to make a determination prior to December 2001, it may be that I should declare victory and go home as well. 
   I want to repeat something I tried earlier to discuss. I do not think it is very well understood by many Members of Congress. I certainly do not think it is very well understood by the American people. I say that with great respect. It has been a voyage that has produced some surprising discoveries on my part as well. I am not suggesting I am smarter, more informed than anybody else. I am merely saying I spent time on this. 
   I am deeply concerned that the threat to the United States of America of an accidental and unauthorized launch from Russia goes up every single day that we maintain the force structure as high as we currently have. We have plenty of safety. We have plenty of redundancy. We have plenty of capacity to tell 
   whether we are actually being attacked or whether the signals are false. 
   The Russians do not have any of that or they have a declining amount of it. We are forcing them to maintain at levels, in my view, that are increasing the danger to the people of the United States of America. The danger is enhanced as a consequence of our sort of presuming maybe there is no real risk. 
   I put these numbers out. This is the minimal level. This is what the Pentagon said in 1997. It is what the Pentagon is currently saying is still valid: That the minimal level we need in the number of warheads is 2,500. The reason we need 2,500 is, according to the people who do the targeting--again, they are doing the targeting based upon a Presidential directive, presumably evaluated by the Congress after we do the directing and tell them what needs to be done--there are 2,260 vital Russian nuclear targets. 
   These are on active alert. We are ready to attack. We are not talking about the kinds of missiles that might miss by a couple of miles. These things are going to hit. They are very accurate; they are very sophisticated; and they are very reliable. We have 1,100 nuclear targets. That is to say the Russians hold nuclear weapons. So 1,100 of our nuclear warheads --and we do not have one under 100 kilotons--are going to be targeted on 1,100 Russian nuclear sites. 
   Then there are conventional sites, conventional weapons sites--500 targets; 500 targets. I urge my colleagues to get a map out of Russia and try to come up with 500 targets on top of 1,100 targets of nuclear weapon sites. Part of this debate needs to be done in the open so we can do a commonsense check as to whether or not we have more than we actually need, again forcing the Russians to maintain more than they can control. 
   Mr. President, 160 leadership targets. These are the guys to whom we talk. We have a meeting with them: President Putin, would you agree to modify ABM? And oh, by the way, we have 160 nuclear weapons of 100 kilotons or more targeted on you and all the rest of the Russian leadership. Try to come up with 160 targets. Get a Russian map out and put 160 targets up, or 500 targets, on something called war-supporting industry. This is all published accounts. This is not me coming out of the Intelligence Committee or some top secret briefing; this is now published accounts of this targeting. It is vital for the American people to understand that; otherwise they are going to say to the Congress: Just keep doing what you are doing; it seems to be working. 
   The longer we continue doing what we are doing, the more likely it is that the horrible, unimaginable disaster occurs and that is an accidental unauthorized launch against the United States of America on the people of America and that the people suffer as a result. 
   I have no idea if President Clinton would do an expedited review and say: I am going to try to strike a deal with President Putin that will allow us to go to lower levels of ABM to solve the stalemate we have over missile defense. He may not take the option. 
   Whether he takes the option or not, I believe it is unwise for us to be tying the hands of President Clinton. I think it would be unwise to tie the hands of President Gore, President Bush, or any President in this fashion. We had never done it up to 1998. There may have been a compelling argument prior to the Duma's ratification of START II, but there is no longer a compelling argument, in my view, and it would be a mistake for us to have this continuing limitation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield on that, the language of the Senator's amendment doesn't say that. That was the question I was going to ask the Senator from Colorado. It doesn't preclude the President from doing a review before December 2001. The Senator from Virginia was saying so long as it is GORE or Bush, it is OK; but if it is Clinton, it is not. 
   This is June 6, the day Franklin Delano Roosevelt, while going through a Presidential campaign, authorized the landing on the beaches of Normandy. There was bipartisan support for it. He was running against Dewey at the time, and he was courageous enough to say we were going to have a bipartisan foreign policy. 
   The thing that concerns me is that we are losing that. We are saying President Clinton can't do it. If it is Bush or GORE, fine, they can do it, but Clinton can't. I think that is a signal that we are not willing--for example, the Senator said earlier President Bush signed START II after the November election and authorized troops to go to Somalia late in his term. We understood it was late in his term and that he might not have won the election, but, by gosh, the President had the authority to make these decisions right up to the end of his term. This amendment seems to be saying, although I think the language of the amendment--I am trying to ascertain whether or not I should vote for this amendment because it appears the language would allow the President to do an expedited review. It doesn't say he can't have it done earlier. It may be that the Senator's intent is to prevent President Clinton from doing it. But I don't believe the language of the amendment does that.

Would it prevent an expedited review? Say he has Colin Powell or former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Henry Kissinger and George Shultz advising him, and the four of them say we believe he ought to go to 5,000, and 
   the Secretary of Energy is going to notify Bush on February 1; would your amendment preclude that?

It doesn't preclude President Clinton or Bush or GORE from saying we can finish that part of the review faster than the rest of the review and have the Secretary of Energy submit it to Congress for congressional consideration. By the way, you can strike this provision and there is no guarantee at all that President Clinton is going to take any action. He hasn't thus far. He hasn't asked for authority.

   Mr. KERREY. The Senator's answer is yes, for a new President. He could do it as long as he is satisfied with the definition of ``careful review.'' He could do it prior to December of 2001. According to this amendment, it has to be submitted by 2001. So a careful review could be done before December 2001. 
   I am trying to get the Senator to talk me into voting for his amendment. That is what I am attempting to do here. If the answer is yes, as it appears to be, you may not want President Clinton to make the decision. By the way, I think it is unlikely that he will. He hasn't thus far. 
   I just think it would not be a good thing for us to say that we are going to put a restriction on this President that we are not going to put on the President-elect, whoever that happens to be.

   Mr. KERREY. First of all, I think it would be a very unwise thing to do.  
   Again, as I indicated earlier, President Bush took action on START II after the election of 1992. President Bush committed troops to Somalia late in his term without getting my objection to do it. I wasn't going to draw a line in the sand late in his term if he saw a threat to this Nation. And if he had a policy, I would agree with that policy. I was not going to prevent him from doing it simply because it would be late. I think that would be inadvisable. 
   I look at the language of the amendment. I don't see any need to do in the amendment what the Senator is saying. It seems to me that the language of the amendment says it has to be submitted by December 2001, but also there is language in there precluding President Clinton, if he could, to accelerate a review if he chose to. 
   I am trying to get the Senator to talk me into voting for his amendment because it seems to me the language of his amendment would allow the President, if he chose to, to do the review just as President-elect Bush or President-elect GORE could do.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, it is not desirable, if the 
   Senator from Virginia seeks to get additional support. I am saying that as long as he keeps the language the way it is right now, I can interpret this in a way that allows President Clinton to do so if he chooses. Again, I say to my good friends on that side that President Clinton hasn't indicated any desire to do so. 
   Why would we want to draft this amendment so that it prevented an existing President from doing something that a new President could do if the existing President hasn't demonstrated any willingness to do so in the first place? 
   It seems to me if Congress is saying we just do not trust this particular President, and we are not going to allow him to do that, it is a very bad signal. It signals to people that may have a bad intent toward the United States of America that they might be able to get away with things. They might be able to do things in this current environment as a consequence of Congress not willing to allow what normally the Commander in Chief would be allowed to do.

   Mr. KERREY. First, I appreciate very much the statement of the Senator from Arizona. We have been together on a number of occasions before the intelligence committee and in the public environment talking about the threat of the missiles, especially from rogue states. I have enjoyed those associations very much. 
   He is quite right; the systems are extremely complicated. We do talk about warheads and we ought to focus on the platforms. One of the problems is that it is very rare we have a chance to focus on any of these. It is debated too little, in my view. These are not bullets; these are very complicated systems. If you are the STRATCOM, you have a Presidential directive that tells you what you are supposed to do. Again, that is where it all begins, with a Presidential directive and a PPD 60 that was updated during the Clinton administration. You set forth talents. You are the CINC in charge of this. You have ICBMs, submarine launch ballistic missiles; you have your bombers at your disposal; and you are calculating whether they will be reliable, whether they are available, whether they will be able to do what that Presidential directive says you have to do. I am challenging the Presidential directive, the policy itself. 
   As I understand it, I thought earlier we could have some flexibility in this amendment. I am uncomfortable tying this thing to quadrennial review. I don't want to speak for the administration. I am not on the Armed Services Committee so I haven't been there when they made the presentations, but I have, as a consequence of being provoked to do so, requested a briefing from STRATCOM that was given to General Shalikashvili in 1997 and was presented to the Armed Services Committee. I believe both the chairman and ranking member received that briefing, as well. I am satisfied that is a current analysis. I am satisfied that it needs relatively little attention. 
   I don't agree with what the chairman has said, saying that the President has not been evaluating this over the last 7 years. He has arms control negotiators. In fact, he has resisted pressure from this side of the aisle to do the very thing I am talking about right now. He has been unwilling to do it; he has been unwilling to go lower, to do the thing that President Bush did in 1991. 
   I am not certain, even if this section were stricken, that the President would take any action, but I am not willing to accept that there hasn't been a sufficient amount of review done on this, and I think it would be unwise, as I hear now, not only restricting President Clinton but restricting President-elect Bush or President-elect GORE.  
   Earlier in a colloquy with the author of the amendment, it seemed there was some flexibility. But I hear the Senator from Arizona saying, no, there is not; it would have to be submitted concurrent with the quadrennial review, which is expected in December of 2001, and it may not be done 2001. It could take longer than December of 2001. We are saying that the current President and future Presidents could not, if they got an attractive offer from the Russians to accept the kind of modifications in ABM that permit a vigorous deployment of missile defense along the lines of what Governor Bush is talking about, this would prohibit Governor Bush from doing that unless we came in and changed the law again. 
   I think we should not be tying the hands of the President in these kinds of negotiations. What current law does, as modified by the Senator from Virginia, is to untie it slightly, but as I understand it now and if the Senator from Virginia agrees regarding the explanation of the Senator from Arizona in an earlier evaluation, that could not be done, but only submitted concurrent with the submission of the quadrennial review.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KERREY. In answering the question of the Senator from Michigan, that portion that was directed to me at least, first of all I say you are right. I think the question is, Do we need an additional review, more than we have already had, to support a President if the President decides to go at lower levels? That is what this amendment says. This amendment says we need additional review and it needs to be more thoughtful than we have had thus far. 
   I am prepared to say, with the little I know--you know more than I on this subject--that we have had thoughtful and serous review done. What the amendment does is it ties the hands of a President, this President and the President-elect, if we have to wait for it to be submitted concurrently with the quadrennial review, and it weakens him as a consequence. It says to the people who are negotiating with him, if an offer is put on the table by this President that is different from what the current law allows, he cannot do it. He can't sit down and negotiate with President Putin to go to lower levels in exchange for a modification of ABM because the law prevents him from doing it. 
   It weakens an incumbent President. That is exactly what it does. I think that is what it is intended to do. That is what it will successfully accomplish. I don't think--in fact, I know--from my experience of the Senator from Virginia that is precisely the opposite of the sort of thing he would want. He would avoid it. I am going to listen to the answer of the Senator from Virginia and then come back in the morning to hear even more. 
   But in the spirit of bipartisanship, I understand the Senator from Virginia is going to be offering later, perhaps, an amendment that would provide some resources for the operation of a World War II memorial.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a life of service devoted to defending the values and ideals of our nation. On July 1, 2000 the country will lose to retirement its Deputy Commander in Chief of the United States Strategic Command, Lieutenant General Phillip J. Ford, USAF. Through his leadership, General Ford has taken the United States and U.S. Strategic Command into a new world environment. During his career, his guidance and foresight helped see the U.S. Military into the new millennium. 
   Throughout a career that spans four decades, General Ford has commanded the 8th Air Force, the 384th Bomb Wing, and the 524th Bomb Squadron. As commander of the 384th at McConnell Air Force Base, Kansas, he transformed and entire installation to bring in and support a new B-1 bomber wing. General Ford has also served as commandant of the Air Command and Staff College and held key staff positions at the Headquarters of the U.S. Air Force, Military Airlift Command, Air Mobility Command and Strategic Air Command. 
   As the nation's top bomber commander supporting the United States Central Command, General Ford directed an unprecedented global power strike against Iraq during Operation DESERT FOX. Despite tactical and weapon system limitations, his bombers succeeded in retargeting their air launched cruise missiles while airborne and en route to their targets. His forces delivered their weapons on time and on target, guaranteeing mission success. 
   As Deputy Commander in Chief of the United States Strategic Command, and as a strong proponent of an enduring, stable, strategic relationship with Russia, General Ford championed the Defense Department's cooperative threat reduction activities, to include military-to-military contacts. General Ford's historic military-to-military exchanges with senior Russian nuclear commanders built a legacy of respect, mutual understanding and cooperation. The general's insight in planning and evaluating the command's communication capabilities assured the nation that the communication between the President, Secretary of Defense, Joint Chiefs and men and women at the helm of ballistic missile submarines, intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear bombers remained intact despite Y2K concerns. His efforts will have an enduring, positive impact on strategic stability for many years to come. 
   Lieutenant General Ford and his wife, Kris leave the military after a distinguished 34 year career serving their nation. The people of the United States salute General Ford and Mrs. Ford and wish them well as they begin a new chapter of their lives after military service.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise in support of this crop insurance conference report. 
   As my colleagues from the Agriculture Committee are well aware, this legislation has been a work in progress for a good long time. 
   The final package we reached with the House and that we bring to the floor today is a very good bill. Farmers in my home state of Nebraska are going to be very pleased with it, as are farmers of all types of crops all across the Nation. 
   The major provisions of this bill reflect just what we heard when Senator ROBERTS and I asked farm and lending groups what they wanted in this legislation, nearly one and a half years ago. 
   At that time, they asked for more affordable coverage, equity for revenue insurance, more new and innovative policies from the private sector and a better program for specialty crops. 
   This bill includes all of those provisions. 
   Although we've provided additional subsidies to buy crop insurance for the past two years, this bill makes them permanent law. 
   And we go one step further by increasing subsidies even higher at the very highest levels of coverage--a provision that would have been especially helpful to farmers this year, as a broad stretch of the Midwest and South face severe drought. 
   The final bill moves the Risk Management Agency in what I strongly feel is the right direction, toward being a regulator instead of competitor. We place new product development fully in the hands of the private sector, whether it be insurance companies, trade associations, or universities. 
   It includes authority that will finally help provide independent advice to the FCIC Board of Directors and create an equal review process for all new policy submissions. 
   The bill includes and builds upon ideas forwarded by our colleagues from Florida, Senators GRAHAM and MACK, regarding new policy development for specialty crops. 
   It includes an important provision first advocated by our Ag Committee colleagues, Senators BAUCUS and CRAIG, to remove the area yield trigger requirement from the Non-Insured Assistance Program. 
   There are dozens of other equally important provisions in this bill that benefit each and every region of the country. While I am aware that the row-crop producing parts of the country will gain the most immediate benefits because of their long-standing participation in the crop insurance program, the potential for the program to work just as well along the coasts and in the south is given great weight under this legislation. 
   Not every provision benefits every region; a few are specific only to one region or commodity. That is how we finally ended up with a bill with national appeal, and I am very proud of that effort. 
   Let me say just a few words about the additional 2000 and 2001 spending added to the crop insurance bill. 
   I am pleased that the Budget Committee included additional ag spending in the budget resolution this year, much as they did crop insurance funding last year, and of course Senators CONRAD and GRASSLEY are responsible for that and I thank them. 
   My concerns--and the concerns of many Nebraskans--are well-known: distributing additional payments through the Freedom to Farm mechanism is unfair to many and the cause of a number of the problems rural communities are facing. 
   These payments, based on planting decisions made in the 1970s and 1980s, disadvantage younger farmers and those who have traditionally rotated crops or tried to diversify--exactly contrary to what Freedom to Farm was supposed to accomplish. 
   Some payments go to producers and landowners who are no longer producing the crop upon which their additional payment is based. Even worse, under this approach payments go to people who no longer farm at all. 
   The complaint I hear most frequently is about the crops included in these payments versus those that are not. Freedom to Farm is destroying the alfalfa processing industry in Nebraska. As prices for other commodities have collapsed, more and more farmers are growing alfalfa--a non-program crop. Yet they continue to benefit from these payments, even while long-time alfalfa producers receive nothing. 
   Adding additional payments for oilseeds--even while most oilseed producers already receive Freedom to Farm payments and enjoy an artificially high support price--makes even less sense. 
   Despite the great expectations surrounding this farm program, I contend that it creates greater market distortions than those supposed ``failed'' farm programs of the past. 
   And meantime, we spend billions of dollars each year to keep it in place, while our rural communities are dying. 
   Also attached to this bill is additional spending for 2001. 
   This package represents a good-faith effort by Chairman LUGAR and Chairman COMBEST to put together a package acceptable to the majority, and I do not envy their work. 
   Although there are provisions in the package I do not support, there are many that I do. 
   I commend them for structuring a package with national appeal and for giving consideration to a broad group of commodities and interests. 
   Finally, let me offer my sincere thanks to a number of people for their work on this bill. Chairman LUGAR and his staff have worked very hard on this legislation and made a tremendous effort to advance the often-diverse opinions of members of the Ag Committee. 
   Thanks also to our ranking member, Senator HARKIN, and to his staff, as well as to our minority leader, Senator DASCHLE, and his staff. They made this legislation possible. 
   The coalition that joined Senator ROBERTS and me on this legislation way back in March of 1999 and worked together throughout deserves special recognition: Senators HARKIN, CONRAD, DASCHLE, BAUCUS, JOHNSON, SANTORUM, ROBERTS, GRASSLEY, and CRAIG. Special mention must go to staff for each of these members, for working together tirelessly and in a completely bipartisan fashion. 
   Let me also thank the Senate Legislative Counsel, especially Gary Endicott, for his work throughout this process, including too many nights and weekends. 
   And finally, my deepest thanks to Senator ROBERTS and to Mike Seyfert of his staff for their perseverance and good humor for the last eighteen months. Their commitment to making this legislation bipartisan--right up to the closing hours--is a tribute to Kansas and the Senate.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I will take a few seconds. Earlier in my statement I said very nice things, as they deserved, about the chairman, ranking member, and their staffs and every other staff member of the Agriculture Committee except for one. That was the person who wrote the statement I was reading earlier on the floor. So I want to just take a moment to thank Bev Paul for all the work she did on this piece of legislation. I appreciate very much Senator HARKIN, you and Leader DASCHLE, trusting me enough to put me on the conference 
   committee. I appreciate Bev's contribution to it.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to offer my support for passage of H. Con. Res. 302, a resolution proclaiming a National Moment of Remembrance. 
   As we gather with family and friends in observance of Memorial Day, I urge all Americans to take time to reflect upon the day's true meaning. Whether we attend a public observance, mark a grave, or simply bow our heads in quiet reflection, all Americans should remember to honor those who by serving,  put their faith and trust in the ideals for which our nation stands. 
   The legislation we are about to pass will establish a National Moment of Remembrance at 3:00 local time on Memorial Day. At that time, I am hopeful all Americans will join together in recognition of those men and women who have died in military service of our nation. 
   Finally, I thank my colleague from Nebraska, Senator HAGEL, and Carmella LaSpada of No Greater Love for their efforts in making the National Moment of Remembrance a reality.

   Mr. KERREY. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank the group of people who organized the Million Mom March on Mother's Day. Three-quarters of a million people coming to Washington, DC, is rather impressive. I suspect even opponents of what they are trying to do are impressed with citizens' willingness to come to their Nation's Capital, especially in this case, declaring their intent to organize in a peaceful, law-abiding fashion to change the law. I wish them all the good luck in the world, and I appreciate very much the effort they have made and the success they had on Mother's Day. 
   I also thank Senator DASCHLE for bringing the juvenile justice issue back before this body. All of us--at least I do in Nebraska--wrestle with this question of juvenile justice on almost a daily basis. Whenever I am back in the State, it quickly goes to the top of the list of things about which people are concerned. We have methamphetamine problems and other law enforcement problems, but juvenile justice is at the top of the list. 
   This legislation would be relatively easy to pass were it not for this gun show amendment which I will address. It has tougher enforcement provisions, but it also provides resources to States, Governors, and community organizations so we can prevent crime from happening in the first place. It is almost without controversy that the compromise provisions we reached on the law enforcement side and the prevention side will work, and the communities are asking for that bill. What is holding it up is this gun show provision. I have come to the floor to talk about it. 
   I listened carefully to the opposition to the original Lautenberg amendment, especially those who said there was too much paperwork, too much regulation. I played a role in it, I called Tom Nichols in Omaha, NE, who operates one of the largest gun dealerships in the Midwest to ask him if he would help me fashion something. Frankly, I worked  with Mr. Nichols before trying to reduce the paperwork gun dealers face, which does not increase safety but increases paperwork without anything one can measure and say was beneficial. 
   He agreed, understanding he would take a little heat for participating. I shipped him the Lautenberg amendment. He made modifications and changes. Senator LAUTENBERG offered that amendment the second time. Now, what we are talking about is something that, in my view, requires a minimal amount of regulations. 
   As the Senator from New York said earlier, unlike most businesses, a gun dealer has a relatively small amount of regulation to face. It may feel like a lot if it is your business. I am licensed to sell alcoholic beverages in the State of Nebraska, and there is no restriction that someone can only come in once a year to inspect my premises, and if I destroy my records, it is only a misdemeanor. They can come in six times a day if they want to make certain I am obeying the law. We have a fairly light hand already in terms of regulation, given the transactions that are in place. 
   The Lautenberg-Kerrey--if I can be so bold as to call it that--amendment decreases in a significant way the paperwork that was required in the original amendment. 
   If one looks at the statistics, there are a very high number of handguns that are purchased from dealers, about 3.5 million, and about 2 million that are purchased off the books. I am not saying all those are bought at gun shows, but there are 2,000 to 5,000 gun shows every year, so a pretty big fraction of those are purchased there. 
   Like every licensed dealer, this is what the gun show dealer will have to do: They will have to register with ATF and pay a small fee. If someone objects to the size of the fee, let's debate that. They license themselves; they just register with ATF. 
   Each vendor has to show proof of identification when they check into the gun show. All they verify is that the vendor is who he or she claims to be. 
   The gun show promoter has to let people know every gun sold has to go through the NICS background check. That is a full 3-day background check. That is the extent of the regulation. We modified the original amendment and now have one that, in my view, will save lives. Will it save millions of lives? Probably not. Will it save hundreds of lives? Probably not. What value do we place on a human life? How do we value the number of lives that have already been saved by the Brady background checks themselves? 
   The State of Nebraska is a State where hunting is almost a religion; it is a way of life. Kids in Nebraska are raised to handle guns in a safe fashion at a very early age, to handle long rifles, to handle shotguns, and even handguns at a very early age. These people are not the problem. I would not be here voting for something that is going to impose a regulatory requirement upon them if I did not believe strongly that it will save lives in other parts of the country. In my view, it will. That is what this is all about. 
   Are we going to try to balance the needs of one group of people against the needs of another? The Senator from New York talked about that. That is exactly what we do. That is what the doctrine of relative rights says. I do have freedom of speech, unless my freedom of speech bumps up and endangers the life of somebody else. Oftentimes, that is the problem with guns. 
   I agree with those who say we ought to enforce the laws. I agree that law enforcement needs to be given more power. But, I don't agree that enforcing the laws alone is the answer. We must also enact reasonable measures like this. 
   This is a very reasonable change in the laws of the land. It imposes what I consider to be a very modest regulatory burden upon people who are organizing gun shows. It is hardly about any measurement of regulation. Go to any business in America where we regulate for safe drinking water or anything else. This is a relatively small burden for such an obvious benefit. 
   I hope Senators will examine--I see the Senator from New Jersey is here--what I have been calling it the Lautenberg-Kerrey amendment. It imposes a very small burden upon people who are opening up gun shows and operating gun shows. I do not want to shut down the gun shows. This, obviously, does not shut them down; this allows them to continue to operate. 
   In addition, there is another argument that the playing field needs to be leveled, that the regulatory playing field needs to be the same on every premise where guns are sold. Why should you give me an advantage? Why should you say if you want to be a licensed gun dealer, build a building, and hire and employ people to work in your local community, there is a set of regulations you have to go through. But if all you want to do is have a gun show once every 6 months or so, you do not have to go through the same kind of regulation. 
   I appreciate very much that this has become a contentious debate, but frankly, when you look at what we are asking in the regulation, it perplexes me. 
   This is holding up a very important piece of legislation. The Juvenile Justice Act is a piece of legislation, in my view, that will reduce crime and reduce violent crime and increase the likelihood that it will prevent them as well. It has been worked out. Republicans and Democrats came together. It was a very big vote. My guess is, it will probably be 100-0 without this one particular contentious provision. 
   I hope Senators will examine what this so-called gun show provision does. It is not unreasonable regulation. It is reasonable regulation that, based upon the success of Brady, we can say will produce a benefit that is worth the price. 
   That is what all of us, as we try to figure out whether or not we are going to support a particular regulation, regardless of who is being regulated, ought to examine. Is the cost of the regulation worth the benefit we get? In this case, I overwhelmingly, enthusiastically, and unfortunately painfully, because it is slowing down the enactment of a very good law, come to the conclusion that it will. 
   I hope through the course of this debate, this will become clear. A majority in the country, 80 percent of the people, favor it when it is described specifically to them. It is not something that should be slowing down the Juvenile Justice Act. Indeed, we ought to see it as not only consistent with, but strengthening the Juvenile Justice Act and pass it with all due speed. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to correct an inequity in the tax code which can hurt homeowners who sell their homes at a loss. I am delighted to be joined by Senator HATCH in introducing this legislation. 
   We all know someone who, for whatever reason, has wound up selling their home at a loss. In these situations, where the value of a home is less than the outstanding loan on that home, a mortgage lender will sometimes forgive all or part of the outstanding mortgage balance. Under current law, the amount forgiven is counted as taxable income to the seller. 
   This doesn't make any sense, particularly since gains on a principal residence are tax exempt up to $500,000. The legislation we are introducing today will fix this problem by exempting taxpayers from including in ordinary income mortgage amounts forgiven by the lender on a principal residence, provided the proceeds of the home sale won't satisfy the qualified outstanding mortgage. 
   The legislation we are introducing today is targeted to protect against any abuse and we expect the cost to be very low over a 10-year period. I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this legislation.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, in today's information age, the threat of electronic attack is more likely than a  nuclear attack. Words such as ``cyber-terrorism'' and ``hackers'' have crept into everyday talk, no longer confined to the world of computer nerds and geeks. Despite being one of the most technologically-advanced countries in the world, United States technology is not capable of keeping intruders out and secrets in. Flaws have been found in the computer systems of the Pentagon, IRS, bank networks, utility companies, and telecommunications providers, among others, making all of them vulnerable to attack. 
   The question, then, is what can we do as a country to protect both the government and industries from electronic attack? I believe we need to start early to equip more people with technological skills needed to build and maintain secure information technology networks. Today, along with my good friend Senator ROBERTS from Kansas, I am pleased to be introducing legislation that will do just that. 
   The vehicle we use to achieve this is the highly reputable Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Foundation, which currently awards scholarships to college juniors and seniors studying math and science. I doubt any of my colleagues would dispute the vast success of the Goldwater foundation. Nearly 20 percent of last year's Rhodes Scholars were Goldwater Scholars first; and in the last eleven years, Goldwater Scholars have won 19 Marshall, 6 Churchill, 9 Fulbright, 23 Hughes, 65 NSF and numerous other fellowships. 
   Our bill is simple: We increase funding for the Goldwater foundation by 20 million dollars, taking it from 61 to 81 million dollars. That money will go for scholarships to a new category of students, those studying ``information protection technology''. By training these young people, we can set up our technological infrastructure so it becomes safe from intruders. 
   Let me paint you a picture. Fifty years ago we suffered a devastating attack on Pearl Harbor. The siege lasted five hours. 2403 lives were lost, as were twenty ships and 188 aircraft. That attack catapulted the United States into World War II. As a country, however, we emerged from the war more powerful than we had been entering it. Along with the Soviet Union, the U.S. was deemed a ``superpower,'' and we have yet to give up that title. 
   A devastating attack today would take a much different form and have much more catastrophic consequences. We are not likely to be attacked by airplanes and ships. Rather, it is far more likely that we will be attacked through our technology systems. The attack can occur in as little as ten seconds, and the effects can devastate our whole industrial and governmental infrastructure. A cyber-terrorist can wipe out all financial records, plunge aircraft from the air with no warning, corrupt our entire national defense system, and render telecommunications useless. And it can happen in just seconds, virtually undetected. And we were worried about Y2K. 
   If this scenario frightens you, good. These threats are very real, and with our growing dependence on informational systems, as a country we become more vulnerable every day. One needs to look no further than the now infamous ``I love you'' computer virus that swept this world last week to get a glimpse at how quickly this can occur, and how devastating such an attack can be. 
   The Pentagon, other government agencies, and many industries have set up departments to handle cyber-security, but we need to do everything we can to ensure that these departments can be staffed by knowledgeable information-protection experts. Without skilled staff, these departments are useless. The Information Protection Technology Scholarships will help ensure that the students in college have the opportunity to learn as much as possible about protecting technology. In turn, these students will repay the nation by putting their skills to work to make our technological infrastructure more secure. Twenty million dollars is not much to ask for to protect the entire United States from the possibility of wide-ranging cyber-terrorism. 
   One final note. With such a shortage of qualified American workers, America's high tech industry is hiring people from other countries to come to the United States and fill these jobs. Highly trained immigrants enter this country under the H1-B visa program. Congress raised the cap on H1-B visas from 65,000 to 115,000 for FY '99, and it wasn't enough: we reached that cap by June last year. Later this month, the Senate is expected to consider another increase of H1-B visas to 195,000 per year for FY00, 01 and 02. I support this proposed increase; however, I firmly believe we must do everything in our power to grow our own labor force. That is why I intend to offer this bill as an amendment to S. 2045 when it is considered on the Senate floor.

    Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Domestic Carbon Storage Incentive Act of 2000 with Senators BROWNBACK and MURKOWSKI. Agriculture must play a major role in any climate change plan, since it is an important part of both the cause and the solution. While the facts about global warming are not all clear, what is clear is that global warming is occurring. What is also clear is that human activities are emitting increasingly large volumes of greenhouse gases, and that these gases are influencing global warming. 
   Carbon sequestration, that is pulling carbon from the air into the soil, is an important part of fighting global warming, and agriculture is one of the largest and most economical carbon ``sinks.'' Farmers and ranchers can store additional carbon in the soil fairly easily, using best management practices such as no-till farming, increased production of high carbon-storing crops, and increased use of winter cover crops. Storing carbon in the soil is not only good for the environment, it is also advantageous for soil quality and agriculture production. I am pleased that farmers and ranchers are beginning to realize that carbon sequestration is a win-win situation. Agriculture is sometimes hesitant to adopt change, however, and it is important to provide producers with the opportunity to fully utilize carbon-storing techniques. 
   This bill will give agriculture producers added financial incentive to adopt these best management practices. Unlike CRP, the land will not be a set-aside, but rather these practices will be used on land in production. This program will be completely voluntary, with farmers competing for entrance into the program by proposing specific plans to store more carbon in their land. The best plans will be awarded ten-year contracts with payments no greater than twenty dollars per acre each year. 
   Some farmers have expressed concern about using these carbon-storing techniques on their land, however, because current studies only involve small experimental plots. This legislation will implement carbon sequestration practices on whole farms, both to gather more data on beneficial techniques and to set examples for other farmers to follow. 
   While measuring carbon storage is a difficult task, the most direct means of determining soil carbon sequestration is to measure, over time, sequential changes in the soil. At a recent Senate Agriculture Subcommittee hearing, several scientists and policy-makers advocated a greater need for more research and more data. This program will provide actual data from different soil types across the nation, furthering our collective knowledge of causes and solutions to global warming. 
   The Domestic Carbon Storage Incentive Act is an important step in moving agriculture's role in fighting climate change forward. Carbon sequestration will benefit everyone: farmers, ranchers, the environment, and society. This bill will serve a public good, valued far above the cost of the program. Congress has the opportunity to take action to combat global warming, and I hope that the Senate can begin to achieve this goal by acting on this sound legislation.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am joined by my esteemed colleagues Senator MCCAIN and Senator MOYNIHAN in introducing the Social Security Protection, Preservation, and Reform Commission Act of 1990''. I am honored to join these two distinguished colleagues in an effort to create a bipartisan and bicameral Congressional Commission to reform Social Security. 
   I am pleased to join Senator MCCAIN in a serious effort to provoke this body to move beyond demagoguery and toward action on the subject of Social Security reform. Senator MCCAIN has had the unique benefit of spending the earlier part of this year talking to thousands of constituents from across America about their hopes and concerns during the course of his Presidential campaign. As Senator MCCAIN has noted to me, a great majority of these people expressed particular concern for the future state of the Social Security program. Americans have intense feelings of patriotism where Social Security is concerned--and strongly support reworking and preserving this program for generations to come. 
   My friend's commitment to an honest debate and a reform agenda has sparked the continued interest and attention of millions of Americans--and his support of the Social Security reform cause makes the program's eventual reform all the more likely. 
   I am also honored to be joining my dear friend Senator DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN in introducing this legislation. Senator MOYNIHAN has perhaps the most distinguished record of accomplishment where Social Security is concerned of anyone in this body--perhaps even in this country. As a former member of the Greenspan Commission, which restored solvency to the Trust Funds in 1983, Senator MOYNIHAN is a seasoned veteran of reform commissions--and we welcome his counsel on, and support of, this legislation. My dear friend's participation in the Greenspan Commission also reminds us of what can happen when Congress waits until the last possible moment to restore solvency to this important program. As my colleagues may remember, the 1983 Commission met to discuss reforms at a time when the program was in severe jeopardy--Social Security checks were at risk of not being sent out. Since the 1983 reforms were enacted, future insolvency has again plagued the program. Senator MOYNIHAN has been leading the charge to ensure that Congress does not make the same mistake in waiting until 2037 to reform the program--he knows too well that fixing it now will alleviate great financial pain on future generations. I have been honored to co-sponsor two reform bills with Senator MOYNIHAN--and I am honored to call him a friend. His wise leadership on this and other issues will be 
   dearly missed when he retires at the close of this 106th Congress. 
   I was skeptical at first about an effort to create a Congressional Commission to reform the Social Security program. But upon further consideration, I have reached the conclusion that a bicameral, bipartisan Congressional Commission is the only way to move beyond the polarizing partisanship and inflammatory rhetoric that stalls action on this important program. 
   The Commission envisioned in our bill will include equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats, including the Chairs and Ranking Members of the Ways and Means and Finance Committees, and the Commissioner of Social Security as a non-voting, ex-officio member. Our bill also creates an expedited process for consideration of the Commission's reform bill in the House and Senate. The process is similar to reconciliation protections for budget and tax measures--and will prevent Members from exercising delaying tactics. 
   Our bill also sets out a number of reform objectives for the Commission to meet, such as maintaining benefits for current beneficiaries, restoring Trust Fund solvency for at least 75-years, and including some form of wealth creation component as part of the Social Security program. 
   I am particularly interested in encouraging this Commission to include some form of individual account provision--with special attention given to making the accounts and the program itself more progressive for low and moderate income individuals. 
   As a Democrat, one of my greatest concerns is the growing wealth gap between the rich and poor. The latest Statistics of Income Bulletin from the IRS shows that the combined net worth of the top 4,400,000 Americans was $6.7 trillion in 1995. In other words, the top 2.5% of our population held 27.4% of the nation's wealth in the mid-1990s. These statistics highlight why we should be concerned about the growing wealth gap. The ownership of wealth brings security to people's lives. The ownership of wealth opens up new opportunities. And the ownership of wealth transforms the way people view their futures. 
   An individual with no financial assets--and no means to accumulate financial assets--cannot count on a secure retirement or ensure that his or her future health care needs will be met. 
   Ownership of wealth is a much more reliable way of becoming financially secure in old age than promises by politicians to tax and transfer income. Ownership of wealth produces greater independence and happiness. The mal-distribution of wealth (the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer) is not healthy for a liberal democracy and a free market economy such as ours. Wealth ownership is the only path to true security--and we must work to enact laws that provide low and moderate income families the opportunities and the tools to acquire wealth. 
   We will never reach a stage in which all Americans are full participants in the growth of the American economy, unless we enact comprehensive pension reforms that will improve savings opportunities for low income workers, and modernize and improve the Social  Security program so that it becomes more than just a mechanism for transferring income. 
   I look forward to a spirited and substantive debate on the subject of Social Security in the upcoming Presidential election. And I am hopeful that our Congressional Commission proposal can become the vehicle by which the next President can work with Congress to create a bipartisan consensus on Social Security reform.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, in the debate over tax cuts our attention is understandably drawn to the question of who pays those taxes and from this a debate commonly ensues over who should get the benefits of tax reductions. This argument leads us to consider the disparities of income and the need to make certain that our tax laws are not written so as to increase income inequality and hopefully to write our tax laws in order to give a boost to those whose wages are lower. 
   Today, I rise to talk about a problem facing Americans that is related to but different from the income inequality. The problem I will address today is the growing gap between the richest Americans and the poorest. 
   The latest Statistics of Income Bulletin from the IRS shows that the combined net worth of the top 4.4 million Americans was $6.7 trillion in 1995. In other words, the top 2.5 percent of our population held 27.4 percent of the Nation's wealth in the mid-1990s. No doubt this group of wealthy Americans feels very financially secure. 
   But what about the other 97.5 percent of Americans? Is the security of wealth spread in a reasonably equitable way across all American households? The answer in my view, is a tragic and emphatic no. 
   Although there is a perception that the recent rapid growth in the stock market has produced widespread economic gains among all income groups, a majority of households still do not own stock-based assets and, thus, have not participated in the growth of the 1990s economy. A complete picture is presented in the United States Federal Reserve's Survey on Consumer Finances. This report provides us with the following statistics: 
   Since 1989, the share of net worth owned by the top 1 percent of American households has grown from 37.4 percent to 39.1 percent, while the share of net worth held by the bottom 40 percent of households has dropped from .9 percent to a statistically near insignificant .2 percent. 
   Nearly 60 percent of the wealth held by families in the lowest 90 percent of the population is in the family home--not liquid assets that can be used as a source of income and security at retirement. Families in the lowest 90 percent of the population had only 3 percent of their assets in stocks and bonds. 
   While an increasing number of Americans are purchasing stock-based equities--49 percent in 1999 vs. 40 percent in 1995--only 29 percent of households own stock worth more than $5,000, and the top 10 percent of households in the distribution hold 88.4 percent of the value of all stocks and mutual funds. In fact, the top 1 percent holds 51.4 percent of the value of all stocks and mutual funds--while the bottom 90 percent hold just 11.6 percent of the total value. 
   These statistics show that the gains of the great 1990s stock market runup have not benefitted a majority of Americans. The gains have not narrowed the gap between the wealthiest in America and the poorest in America. In fact, the data analyzed in a study done by the preeminent wealth statistician, Mr. Ed Wolff, reveals that the wealthiest 10 percent of households enjoyed 85 percent of the stock market gains from 1989 until 1998. 
   Why should we be so concerned about the growing wealth gap? I believe the answer is that the ownership of wealth brings security to people's lives and because the ownership of wealth opens up new opportunities and because the ownership of wealth transforms the way people view their futures. 
   An individual with no financial assets--and no means to accumulate financial assets--cannot count on a secure retirement, cannot ensure that his or her future health care needs will be met, and cannot save effectively for important life milestones, such as the purchase of a first home or the funding of a child's college education. 
   Americans clearly understand and desire the freedom and security that comes with wealth. We can point to the ongoing increase in participation rates in 401(k) plans as evidence that people are concerned about amassing wealth for a secure retirement. We can even point to the continued growing popularity of lotteries and game shows like ``Who Wants to Be A Millionaire'' as evidence that people value the security of wealth--especially wealth that is acquired quickly. 
   The virtues of savings and wealth accumulation are clear. But if the virtues are so clear, why aren't more Americans voluntarily increasing their savings? Not a TV show goes by without an advertisement from a financial services company offering investment advice and investment products. Not a week goes by without a front page story about the Social Security funding ``crisis''--implicitly warning people to save for their own retirements. So why aren't more Americans saving? 
   I have identified barriers that I believe continue to prevent a substantial portion of the American population from being able to save, to invest, and to accumulate wealth. 
   Barrier No. 1 is education. 
   No single factor is a greater predictor of income and wealth than education. Property educated and trained individuals can command a premium salary because they are in high demand and in short supply. Only one-third of households are headed by 
   someone with a college degree. These households have a median before-tax income of $55,000 and a median net worth of $146,400. Households headed by a person with no high school diploma have a median income of $15,500 and a net worth of $20,000. 
   In addition to disparate levels of educational attainment, there is a huge problem in America with a specific lack of investor education. Economics and Finance are not required courses in most school districts across the United States. As a result, too few people understand the magic of compounding interest rates and, as a consequence, wait too long to begin saving for their retirement. 
   The second barrier is income. 
   Of course, one of the fundamental rules of wealth accumulation is that you must have income that you can set aside in order to create substantial wealth. A quarter of families in the United States are bringing home between $10,000 and $25,000 a year. Forty percent of American households are bringing in less than $31,000 per year. After FICA taxes of $2,372 and $2,600 in Federal and State income taxes, a typical family of four has little left over for savings. 
   Not only have low and moderate income Americans not shared in the growth of a booming stock market, but they have also not shared in the growth of weekly paychecks. According to the most recent Survey on Consumer Finances by the Federal Reserve Board, mean income grew between 1995 and 1998 only for families headed by individuals with at least some college education--mean incomes for all education groups in 1998 were lower than they had been in 1989. Median income only rose appreciably between 1989 and 1998 for those with a college degree. 
   When you look at two of the lowest income groups, the story of income stagnation is quite grim. Nearly 13 percent of families earned less than $10,000 in 1998. The median salary of this group was $6,200--a real decline of 6 percent since 1989. Nearly one-quarter of families earned between $10,000 and $25,000 in 1998. Of these families, the median salary was $16,900--a real increase of only 2.4 percent since 1989. Clearly, the capacity of this group to save on its own is very limited. 
   Barrier No. 3 is payroll taxes. 
   The payroll tax may not seem like much of a barrier to Americans with  income over $100,000, who only have to pay taxes on the first $76,200 of income, but to American families earning less than $25,000--40 percent of all households--it is a tremendous bite. The total payroll tax paid by an individual earning $25,000 per year and his employer is $3,825. This is several times greater than their income tax bill. For those who propose spending the Social Security tax surplus to enhance Social Security or Medicare benefits, it is worth noting that the lowest 40 percent of American earners pay more than 40 percent of the benefits for both Social Security and Part A Medicare. And those are the individuals must apt to be uninsured. 
   Barrier No. 4 is the burden of debt. 
   Consumer debt has a major impact on a household's ability to save. According to the latest SCF, households earning less than $25,000 annually bear the most significant burden of debt compared to their income. The median ratio of debt payments to income among those earning less than $10,000 is 20.3 percent; among those earning $10,000 to $25,000, the ratio is 17.8 percent. In fact, 32 percent of those making less than $10,000 pay more than 40 percent of their income in debt payments, an increase of 16 percent since 1995. About 20 percent of those making between $10,000 and $25,000 devote more than 40 percent of their income to debt payments. Finally, 15.1 percent of households with less than $10,000 of income had debt payments 60 days past due--a doubling since 1995--which not only reflects an inability to keep up with debt payments but also contributes to bad credit and an inability to purchase a future home, etc. 
   The Federal Government's publicly-held debt also has an indirect impact on the ability of workers to save. As a major borrower, the Federal Government increases interest rates. Higher interest rates lower private capital formation, which in turn hampers growth in productivity and living standards. In addition, higher interest rates on government debt translate into higher interest rates on mortgages, student loans, and credit card debt. When individuals pay higher interest rates, fewer resources are available for saving and investing. 
   With all of these barriers to wealth accumulation, what can we, as lawmakers, do to eliminate these barriers? I believe the answer is twofold. We must create new savings incentives for low and moderate income workers and we must create a mandatory savings mechanism for all workers. 
   A number of legislation initiatives have been offered to help low and income workers save. For years, Senator LIEBERMAN has championed an effort to expand Individual Development Accounts beyond a pilot program. IDAs are a way to encourage lower income folks to save for the purchase of a home, the establishment of a business, or education. 
   President Clinton has offered an interesting plan to get low and moderate income families to participate in employer pension plans through a government savings match program. While Senators GRAHAM and GRASSLEY and Representatives PORTMAN and CARDIN have offered comprehensive pension reform proposals designed to expand pension coverage among low income workers. 
   I, along with a bipartisan group of Senate and House Members, have introduced a Social Security reform plan that allows workers to put a portion of their FICA tax dollars into individual savings accounts. Our plan also calls for an additional government savings match program for low income workers. In addition, our plan calls for opening mandatory savings accounts at birth through the KidSave program. 
   What would this plan do? Fifty years from now we would have a much different wealth distribution situation in America. Men and women who today have no chance of accumulating real wealth would accumulate the kind of wealth that provides them with meaningful financial security. A new generation of Americans would be heading toward their retirement years less dependent on government transfers for health or income. If this plan were enacted, it would immediately change Americans' attitude towards saving on account of informing tens of millions of the power of compounding interest rates. 
   Sadly, critics of this proposal to help low income workers acquire assets and share in the growth of the American economy too often misdescribe the impact. The key line that is used in opposition is: ``I am against privatization of Social Security.'' This line will usually produce a round of applause with senior groups who would not be affected by any of the proposals. Even sadder, these critics are also the same ones who prefer to merely offer solutions that include transferring more income and thereby increasing dependency on the Government. I do not believe proposals that merely transfer more income will solve the problem of inequitable distribution of wealth. 
   Ownership of wealth is a much more reliable way of becoming financially secure in old age than promises by politicians to tax and transfer income. Ownership of wealth produces greater independence and happiness. The mal-distribution of wealth, the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer, is not healthy for a liberal democracy and a free market economy such as ours. The costs of financing health and retirement income needs of the baby boom generation exceeds the tax paying capacity of the generations that follow them. 
   So, Mr. President, after we have spent time debating the need to solve the problem of income inequality we need to turn to the matter of wealth inequality. And when we do we will quickly learn that we will not solve the problem of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer by beating up on the rich. We will solve the problem by lifting the poor out of poverty with programs that enable them to accumulate wealth in a variety of ways including modernizing and improving the Social Security program so that it becomes a means of saving money and a mechanism for transferring income. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, on April 25, 2000 the United States Supreme Court will hear arguments in the Carhart v. Stenberg case. As a lifelong Nebraskan, I have received several requests to take a prominent public position with regard to this case, including a request that I file an amicus brief, also known as a ``friend of the court'' brief in this case. I am honored by these requests, but remain determined not to become officially involved in this case before the Supreme Court. I have come to believe that active involvement in matters before the courts, particularly the U.S. Supreme Court, would be an ineffective use of the power of the Senate office which I hold in trust for all Nebraskans. 
   However, I do not want my silence and absence from these amicus briefs to be mistaken for something that it is not. Because I have had several opportunities as a Nebraska Senator to debate this issue, and because this landmark case before the Supreme Court affects Nebraskans directly, I feel compelled to explain to Nebraskans my thoughts on this important issue. 
   On September 24, 1999, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a Nebraska district court decision that a Nebraska statute banning a medical procedure commonly known as ``partial-birth abortion'' is unconstitutional. The appellate court sustained the decision on the grounds that the Nebraska law creates an undue burden on women seeking abortions. 
   It is my sincere belief that the Eight Circuit's decision should be sustained. In sum, the law adopted by the State of Nebraska (LB 23, June 9, 1997) is too vague to be enforced without placing an undue burden on a woman making this difficult choice. The Supreme Court should uphold the Eighth Circuit's decision because this law bans procedures commonly used for second trimester abortions and will affect any Nebraska doctor who performs either the D&E (dilation and evacuation) or D&X (dilation and extraction) procedure. This statute makes the act of performing legal medical procedures a Class III felony (up to 20 years in jail) and subjects a participating physician to the loss of his or her license. 
   Each year, five thousand women in Nebraska, with the help and counsel of their loved ones, their doctors and their clergy, face the very difficult decision to end a pregnancy. None of us believe that they make their decision lightly. They are guided by their moral beliefs and by the previous decisions of the Supreme Court giving elected State and Federal officials a legal foundation upon which to effectuate, and in some cases limit, the scope of their choices. 
   The central problem with the Nebraska law is that legislators made no attempt to abide by previous Court decisions. Called the ``Partial Birth Abortion Ban'' by its sponsors, the bill has been inaccurately characterized as ``banning certain late term abortions.'' In reality, the bill does not concern itself with late term abortions--neither curbing them nor banning them--which the Court gives lawmakers the capacity to do. Instead the bill seeks to ban a medical procedure used to end a pregnancy without reference to when that procedure is used. Moreover, it bans a medical intervention that is very difficult to define with the precision needed under law to give both doctors and those who enforce the law the guidance they need. 
   Given this uncertainty, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals found that LB 23 was unconstitutional. Writing for the majority, former Chief Judge Richard Arnold explained that it created an undue burden on women because, in many instances, it would ban the most common and safest procedure for second-trimester abortions. The Court pointed out that the term ``partial birth abortion'' has ``no fixed medical or legal content'' and that the Nebraska statute is too broad. 
   Most second and third-term abortions occur in situations where a woman would have preferred, indeed desperately wanted, to carry the baby full term. The doctor made a recommendation based upon a threat to the life and health of the mother if the pregnancy were to continue. A law like Nebraska's would make doctors who perform this procedure liable for prosecution, with penalties that include loss of their license to practice medicine and time in jail. The threat of these penalties could result in physicians choosing not to treat women with a history of high-risk pregnancies. 
   We are wrong to presume that women no longer die during child birth or abortion. Medical science has reduced but not eliminated the risk associated with either. We must not deny women their ability to freely choose to undergo an abortion, or the access to physician care necessary to ensure their safety. 
   Freedom of choice in reproductive decision-making is a constitutional guarantee established by this Court with limitations. Nebraska's law fundamentally ignores the limitations allowed and not allowed by the Court's previous decisions. If it is sustained, it will imperil the safety and well-being of women throughout our state. We cannot allow misinformation to obscure the broad consensus in America that women must decide for themselves how best to live their lives. Moreover, it is equally important that no one be denied the safe and appropriate medical treatment necessary to make a reproductive decision which this law would do. 
   It is my hope that this statement will help Nebraskans better understand my position on this very important matter.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the Department of Defense announced about 2 weeks ago that they are going to delay a critical feasibility test of an interceptor which would protect the United States from a ballistic missile attack. This delay, it should be noted, will give Congress and the President some additional breathing room before we begin the debate to deploy a missile defense system. It may even mean the final decision on deployment may not occur until after the November Presidential election, as many have urged already. 
   However, I believe, we should use this opportunity to consider anew the threats which the United States faces as a consequence of nuclear weapons. The approximately $25 billion missile defense system being contemplated is in response to a threat that does not exist today but very assuredly could if nations such as North Korea, Iran, or Iraq continue to develop their weapons of mass destruction programs. Under estimates provided to us by the CIA's National Intelligence Estimates and a panel of experts headed by Mr. Donald Rumsfeld we have been alerted to, the possibility exists that these countries could have weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them to the United States within 5 years. It is this potential threat, along with a possible accidental or unauthorized launch by Russia, that justifies the attempt to build an effective missile defense system. 
   Three facts should be understood before proceeding further. First, this system is not the original Star Wars proposal of President Reagan. In other words, it is not a system which would protect us against a massive attack by Russia, a threat we now believe no longer exists. Second, the annual costs to build and maintain this new system would be in addition to the estimated $15 to $25 billion annual costs of the nuclear arsenal we maintain against the old threat of the Soviet Union. Third, the deterrent argument we used during the cold war was based on the rational presumption that the Soviet Union would never attack us if they knew that an attack would result in the destruction of their nation. However, we cannot presume rational behavior from North Korea, Iraq, Iran, or potential terrorists will be the order of the day. We presume they would be willing to suffer the consequences of retaliation to do terrible damage to the United States of America. 
   A scenario which imagines such an attack quickly justifies the investment in missile defenses. Even one relatively small nuclear weapon which North Korea, Iran, Iraq, or a non-nation-state terrorist could launch at the United States would inflict more damage than  the largest natural disaster our country has ever experienced. An unauthorized or accidental launch by Russia would be a catastrophe that could kill millions and inflict grave economic and psychological damage to our country. 
   Such a scenario is part of the new world of threats where even, or perhaps especially, the United States, the nation with the largest and most deadly nuclear arsenal, is at risk and can be held hostage to the threats made by otherwise insignificant world leaders. This truth increases the appetite of a few to command even a relatively crude and small nuclear weapon as well as a delivery system to hit us. A strong offensive nuclear capability is not a deterrent because of the irrational behavior of someone who hates and wants to hurt us. Nor was our strong offense a deterrent to India and Pakistan first testing nuclear weapons and then threatening each other with possible first use. 
   We have come a long ways since the beginning of the nuclear age a half century ago. I recently went to the web page of Gen. Paul Tibbets and read his account of the 6-hour flight on August 6, 1945, that dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan. The 86-year-old Tibbets was 
   the pilot of the B-29 called Enola Gay that dropped the atomic bomb, a uranium core device with a 15 kiloton yield nicknamed Little Boy. Three days later a second atomic bomb nicknamed Fat Boy, on account of its plutonium core, was dropped from another B-29 on Nagasaki. The two violent detonations contributed to Japan's unconditional surrender on August 14, 1945. 
   Before I go further, I must declare that I am not an impartial observer of these bombings. My father became part of an occupation force rather than the invasion force, which had been planned for September of 1945. His brother was captured by the Japanese on the Bataan peninsula of Luzon, Philippines, and was killed just days before American forces began the second battle of the Philippines, one of the bloodiest battles of the war. So I am on the side of those who believe President Truman made the right decision. I simply cannot and will not revise history to reach any other conclusion. 
   Still, the civilian deaths caused by those two bombs shock and sicken all who have examined the aftermath of just two atomic detonations. So shocking are the stories that during the 50 years that followed, no American Commander in Chief has ever used these weapons again. Even when a good argument could be made for their effectiveness in saving military and civilian lives by shortening and winning wars, the ``bomb'' was not used. 
   Indeed, as the recent NATO operation against Yugoslavia demonstrated, today's military planners and their political bosses measure the benefits of using conventional weapons against the potential moral and political losses associated with even unintended civilian casualties. Thus has the experience of Hiroshima and Nagasaki become a real and powerful deterrent against the use by the United States of nuclear weapons. 
   This makes it all the more surprising that both the United States and Russia continue to maintain, on hair-trigger alert, huge stockpiles of vastly more powerful and more accurate strategic nuclear weapons than those used 56 years ago this summer. To understand why, we must trace the arguments used since 1945 for the development of our nuclear arsenal. For the first 20 years or so of the cold war, nuclear weapons were seen as an inexpensive alternative to unacceptably high levels of conventional forces that would have been needed to deter a belligerent Soviet Union with an open ambition for more territory in Europe. 
   As the Soviet Union built up its own nuclear capability a new argument--the need to deter a bolt out of the blue attack--eclipsed the old. 
   But, today, neither the Russian conventional or nuclear forces are the threat they once were. Today, we are not fearful of an intentional attack on Europe with conventional forces or a nuclear attack on the United States. Today's threat is that a nuclear weapon could be launched accidentally or without the authorization of the democratically elected Russian President. Today's threat also includes the possibility that Russian technology or materials could be purchased by nations like Iran that have indicated their desire to become a nuclear nation. Finally, today's threat assessment also includes the possibility that Russian elections could once again produce a more dangerous leader whose intentions were less trustworthy. 
   Even with all of these factors considered, I believe our current inventory of strategic nuclear weapons is much larger than what is needed to keep America safe today and in the foreseeable future. This larger inventory forces the Russians to maintain an inventory larger than they can control--which in turn increases the risk of accidental or unauthorized launches and decreases the effectiveness of missile defense. And this larger inventory diverts much needed resources from the modernization of our conventional forces, which we are much more likely to be using in the future. 
   Consider the arsenal currently available to our President. Our Commander in Chief could order the launch of 500 Minutemen III and 50 Peacekeeper missiles in the land-based arsenal. The bulk of the Minutemen III missiles are armed with three 170 to 335 kilotons warheads. The 50 Peacekeeper missiles are each armed with 10, individually targetable warheads with a yield of 300 kilotons each. These land-based missiles would produce 2,000 nuclear detonations each of which each would be 10 to 20 times larger than the Hiroshima bomb. 
   At sea, our President commands 18 Ohio-class submarines. These are the ultimate in survivability, able to stay undetected at sea for long periods of time. As such, our submarine force must give pause to any potential aggressor. Eight of these boats carry 24 C-4 missiles. Each of these missiles are loaded with 8 warheads with 100 kilotons of yield. The other 10 subs carry 24 of the updated D-5 missiles. These missiles also are equipped with 8 warheads with varying degrees of yield from 100 to 475 kilotons. Again, if the President launched all the missiles in the submarine arsenal he would produce 3,500 detonations. 
   In the air, the President commands a strategic bomber force which includes both the B-2 and B-52 bombers. These bombers, in total, have the capacity to carry about 1,700 warheads via nuclear bombs and air launched cruise missiles. 
   Our land-based force can deliver approximately 2,000 warheads on over 500 delivery vehicles with a total yield of about 550 megatons. Our sea-based force can deliver over 3,000 warheads on over 400 delivery vehicles for a total yield of approximately 490 megatons. Our air-based force can deliver 1,700 warheads on approximately 90 delivery vehicles with a yield of 820 megatons. In total, this is about 7,000 warheads with a total yield of over 1,800 megatons. 
   Russia has a similarly deadly force, but with an increasing inability to modernize or maintain these weapons. Because of this, I remain hopeful that President Putin's election will improve the chances of the Russian Duma ratifying START II sometime this spring. But even under START II, the United States and Russia will each maintain in excess of 3,000 warheads at the end of 2007. While both sides hope to quickly follow ratification of START II with a START III agreement, U.S. negotiators have insisted on maintaining approximately 2,500 warheads per side. This comes despite strong indications that within a matter of years Russia will not be able to maintain a force of more than a few hundred weapons and an offer from Russian negotiators that

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the LOCAL TV Act of 2000. Last year, Congress passed a law allowing satellite providers to retransmit local signals into local markets, but we knew then that the large satellite providers had no plans to provide ``local into local'' into rural areas, completely ignoring Nebraska and 14 other states. At the time I strongly supported the inclusion of a $1.25 billion loan guarantee program to encourage companies to retransmit local signals in rural areas. Unfortunately, political wrangling left this important provision behind as we passed the bill. 
   I am pleased that the Senate has fulfilled its promise to pass a loan guarantee program before April 1, 2000. The LOCAL TV Act of 2000 will provide $1.25 billion in loan guarantees to companies to bring local stations into currently unserved areas. Local stations are vital to a community, broadcasting local news, sports, weather, and emergency warnings. A small but significant portion of the U.S. population cannot receive local television signals from any means, while as much as half of the population must settle for New York or Los Angeles news (so-called distant network signals) via satellite. Nebraska has over 270,000 satellite viewers who cannot receive their local stations through their satellite dishes. This bill will provide the financial backing necessary to support companies to bring local television to all areas of America. ``Local into local'' has become another technology that urban areas are able to enjoy, while rural communities get left behind. The LOCAL TV Act will ensure that does not happen. 
   I have great confidence in the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) which is charged with administrating this loan guarantee program. Many previous programs launched through RUS to help  close the gap between urban and rural areas have proven successful. The public/private partnership between RUS and its borrowers has helped develop electric, telecommunications, and safe, clean drinking water in rural America. It has also fostered rural economic development across the nation. I believe the RUS will administer this program with the same expertise it has demonstrated in the past. 
   Bridging the so-called ``Digital Divide'' remains one of my top priorities. It is absurd that some areas of the country cannot receive high speed internet access, local television programming, or other technologies, simply because they live too far from a big city. I will continue to work hard to bring the newest technologies into all regions of Nebraska. The LOCAL TV Act of 2000 is an important step in this direction, so I enthusiastically support this legislation.

   Mr. KERREY. Supporters of this amendment are winning converts. Each election cycle seems to bring them closer to the 67 votes they need to send this 17-word amendment to the States for their ratification. And 49 legislatures have already indicated they would ratify this amendment if Congress were to take this action. 
   Mr. President, these 17 words would make it constitutional for Congress to pass a law giving the government the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States of America. 
   Let me say at the beginning that I have deep respect for those who have views that are different from mine. The Senator from California spoke very eloquently in favor of this amendment. I have heard the distinguished Senator from Utah, indeed, submit a personal appeal for me to reconsider my views on this issue. I have a great deal of respect for the purpose of this amendment. I especially pay tribute to the U.S. American Legion. These patriots have done more than any others to help young Americans understand that freedom is not free. 
   I have had the honor, through 16 years of public service, to experience what the American Legion and other service organizations have done, but especially the American Legion and the Girl's State and Boy's State organizations, taking on the people who do not understand the history and the story of the United States of America. They teach them that story, that history, and they teach them to require the respect necessary to be a good citizen. It is the value they add to our community that is immeasurable. 
   I have listened with an open mind to their appeals that I support this amendment. Regretfully and respectfully, I must say no. 
   I fear the unintended consequence of these 17 words and the laws that may be enacted later will be far worse than the consequences of us witnessing the occasional and shocking and disgusting desecration of this great symbol of liberty and freedom. 
   Mr. President, real patriotism cannot be coerced. It must be a voluntary, unselfish, brave act to sacrifice for others. When Americans feel coercion, especially from their Government, they tend to rebel. So none of us should be surprised if one unintended consequence of the laws that prohibit unpopular activity such as this is an actual increase in the incidence of flag desecration. 
   Another unintended consequence of this amendment will be the diversion of police resources from efforts to protect us from dangerous crime. Nobody should underestimate that this fact will happen. The efforts to protect us from those who desecrate the flag will require the training of police officers on when and where to respond to complaints. 
   Mr. President, we pass the laws, but others must implement and enforce them. They will receive complaints about neighbors and friends or people who desecrate the flag. 
   The police will have to respond to every one of them. These laws will give the power of the Government to local law enforcement agencies to decide when some individual is desecrating the flag. 
   There are 45 words in the first amendment and this amendment protects the rights of citizens to speak, to assemble, to practice their religious beliefs, to publish their opinions and petition their Government for redress of grievance. The 17 words that are in this proposed 28th amendment would limit what the majority of Americans believe is distasteful and offensive speech. 
   Though this seems very reasonable because most Americans do not approve of flag desecration, it is only reasonable if we forget that it is the right to speak the unpopular and objectionable that needs the most protecting by our Government. 
   In this era of political correctness, when the fear of 30 second ads has homogenized and sterilized our language of any distasteful truths, this amendment takes us in the opposite direction of that envisioned by our Founding Fathers whose words and deeds bravely challenged the status quo. 
   Last year when I testified about this before the Judiciary Committee, I took the liberty of buying an American flag and gave it to the committee. 
   I bought that flag because every time I look at it, it reminds me that patriotism and the cause of freedom produces widows. Widows who hold the flag to their bosom as if it were the live body of their loved-one. 
   The flag says more about what it means to be an American than a thousand words spoken by me. Current law protects the flag. If anyone chooses to desecrate my flag--and survives my vengeful wrath--they will face prosecution by our Government. Such acts of malicious vandalism are prohibited by law. 
   The law also protects me and allows me to give a speech born of my anger and anguish in which I send this flag aflame. Do we really want to pass a law making it a crime for a citizen despondent over a war, or abortion, or something else they see going on in their country to give a speech born of their anger? Do we really want a law that says the police will go out and arrest them and put them in jail? 
   I hope not. Patriotism calls upon us to be brave enough to endure and withstand such an act--to tolerate the intolerable. I sincerely and respectfully thank all of those who hold views different from mine for their patriotism. I will pray this amendment does not pass. But I thank God for the love of country exhibited by those who do. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dr. Ernest M. Burgess, a man who has dedicated his life to cleansing sickness from the lives of countless people. 
   When my grandchildren study the events that shaped the development of the twentieth century, the American Century as some call it, they will be learning of the life of Dr. Burgess. I often speak of the admirable sacrifices and tremendous foresight of this generation of Americans: a generation who, more than any before it, left an indelible imprint on the course of human history. Dr. Burgess, like thousands of his contemporaries, was an ordinary citizen who lived an extraordinary life of service and accomplishment. 
   Born eleven years into the new century, Ernie was raised in the character of the rural American West. Influenced by a remarkable aunt who practiced medicine at a time when most women couldn't vote, he became attracted to serving and caring for the sick. Upon completion of his medical degree and residency at Columbia and Cornell Universities, Dr. Burgess served his country in the U.S. Army from 1943 to 1946. 
   Mr. President, one of the bitterest effects of war visits those who suffer debilitating wounds and then live a life forever altered. As an orthopedic surgeon involved in ground breaking advancements in prosthetic surgery, Dr. Burgess has allowed thousands of amputees the opportunity to return to activities unimaginable at the time of the injury. He is a pioneer in the field of prosthetic research and responsible for the establishment of Prosthetics Research Study (PRS), which is one of the leading centers in the world for post-operative care. Through a career that spans six decades, Dr. Burgess has used his medical gifts to improve the health of his fellow humans. 
   As a veteran and amputee, I live with the daily reminder of the costs of war. Because of the work of Dr. Burgess, I and thousands of veterans have a more powerful reminder of our service: one where our lives are complete and rewarding. 
   Through his work with the Prosthetic Research Study, Dr. Burgess pioneered new surgical techniques that allow amputees to move with more comfort and mobility. The development of lightweight and responsive materials have permitted thousands of amputees the freedom to participate in physical activities from skiing to basketball. On a personal note, my passion for running and my ability to ski and play golf and walk these halls could not be a reality without the advances spearheaded by the PRS and Dr. Burgess. 
   Throughout his career, Dr. Burgess has continued to be at the forefront of improving prosthetic techniques. A teacher and author of surgical and rehabilitation texts, he tirelessly emphasizes constructive surgery for amputees. As he often states, ``the way the surgery is performed will affect the rest of his life.'' Dr. Burgess takes this philosophy to heart and I admire his continued pursuit of improving medical care. 
   The effects of war are inflicted mainly on the innocent and young. After American participation in Vietnam ended we slowly realized the breadth of the war's destruction on so many Vietnamese. The existence of thousands of injured civilians highlighted the larger world problem of poor medical treatment in many parts of the world--parts that are also the most war-torn. In 1988, at the prompting of United States Vietnam Veterans who had visited Vietnam, Dr. Burgess and others worked to establish the Prosthetics Outreach Center (POC). This clinic has provided thousands of Vietnamese with free limbs and allowed them to rediscover the completeness of their lives. 
   Mr. President, as the men and women of America's greatest generation, enter a new century, I remain in awe of their continuing achievements. The remarkable career of Dr. Burgess epitomizes the commitment to improving peoples lives through dedicated effort. I am proud to be able to submit this Resolution recognizing a great man and paying tribute to his attainments and his goals. Thank you, Dr. Burgess, and I know my colleagues join me in recognition of your accomplishments.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, last week, in the middle of a 10-day trip to Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Israel, I read a story in the International Herald Tribune about a discovery made by a joint Chinese-United States paleontology team in China. The team found 45-million-year-old fossil remnants of an animal the size of a thumb they believe is a key evolutionary link between pre-simian mammals and human beings. From an analysis of the fossils, the team speculated that the animal met an unfortunate fate: He became the regurgitated meal of a hungry owl. 
   Misery loves company and there are times in the Middle East when one feels like that unfortunate animal trying to figure out and understand what our policy ought to be to pursue peace in that turbulent, difficult region. 
   In the Middle East the search for peace can seem as slow to develop and the politics can be as brutal as the rules of natural selection where survival is the most important virtue. For most of the modern era survival in the Middle East has been defined in military terms. However, because the Middle East is not immune from the competitive demands of the global economy, increasingly survival's definition has been modified with economic strategies and analysis. 
   That is among the most important reasons for improved chances of peace between Israel and Syria. To that end President Clinton's decision to fly to Geneva, Switzerland to meet with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad is a very hopeful sign. The President has a high degree of respect from both President Assad and Israeli Prime Minister Barak. As such, he may be able to convince Mr. Assad to make some gesture to the Israeli people which will make possible the eventual surrender of the all-important Golan Heights. The Golan Heights were captured from Syria on June 10, 1967, at the end of the Six Day War, and have been a part of Israel for 33 years; no Israeli leader can surrender this land unless legitimate security concerns are thoroughly satisfied. 
   If the President's discussions with President Assad do help produce a peace agreement between Israel and Syria, it will add momentum to the successful completion of final status talks between Israel and the Palestinians. It will decrease the potential for tragedy in southern Lebanon following Israel's unilateral withdrawal by July 1. And finally, it will increase the chances that Lebanon could become more independent from Syria. 
   Syria's 15 million people are facing a very uncertain future. This uncertainty begins with the nature of their government--a dictatorship with President Assad in absolute control. Mr. Assad has held power since 1970 and has tried to give the impression of popular support with coerced referendums; in 1991 he received a ``vote of confidence'' from 99.9 percent of Syrians. However, Mr. Assad's age and health make it likely that power will be transferred in the next few years. The current leading candidate is the President's son, Bashar, a thirty year old ophthalmologist. 
   Peace with Israel would make it much more likely that President Assad's son would survive in power. A peace agreement would mean normalized relations with Israel and an end to Syria's support of terrorism. It would make it more likely that badly needed investment would enter the country and it would allow Syria to divert much needed resources from defense into health and education. The resulting economic growth would bring new-found opportunities to the Syrian people though not nearly as great as the opportunities they would have if they would begin a transition away from a dictatorship to democracy. 
   From the Israeli point of view, a peace agreement with Syria would bring benefits that could lead to solving regional economic problems as well as contributing to a more favorable agreement with 
   the Palestinians. Peace would mean that all three nations--Jordan, Egypt and Syria--with whom Israel has fought three wars would recognize Israel's right to exist as an independent nation. 
   In theory it would seem like peace is possible, but the Middle East is a place where life is always standing theory on its head. Not only is a U.S. Presidential election coming to a theater near all of us in 8 months, but the political scene in both Syria--a dictatorship with transition difficulties--and Israel--a democracy divided into smaller and less effective political groups than at an time in its 50-year history--makes it most likely that defeat will once more be snatched from the jaws of victory. 
   I would say the chances of success are comparable to making a three-ball  pool shot on a pool table littered with debris. However, given the benefits of peace it is a shot work taking. 
   The benefits for the United States of an agreement between Israel and Syria are considerable. They include: 
   Improved security for Israel, our closest ally in the region; 
   Increased openness and opportunity for regional cooperation since Israel would then have peace agreements with Syria, Jordan, and Egypt; 
   Decreased threat of terrorism directed at Israel or the United States; 
   Increased chances that Lebanon can become a fully independent and democratic nation; and, 
   Greatly decreased threat of catastrophic use of weapons of mass destruction in this fragile region. 
   The benefits to the United States must be quickly understood by Congress because when an agreement is reached, there is no doubt that the United States will be asked to spend money in order to give both sides the confidence that peace will make them more secure. The figure of $17 billion over a 10-year period has been raised in the press, specifically directed at funding means to give Israel the security which it currently enjoys from being present on the Golan Heights. The dollar costs are important, but I would like to focus less on the amounts than on what will be needed to make an agreement successful. 
   First, Israel needs the assurance of early warning. It needs to be warned about potential missile attacks--or other use of weapons of mass destruction--so it can deter or intercept such attacks. It needs to be warned of potential ground attacks so it has time to mobilize its ground defenses. Without the assurance of early warning, the Israeli people will not feel secure. To emphasize, Israel is a real democracy. They do not have a dictator making the decision. The people have to feel secure in order for a peace agreement to work. Without real security, the Israeli people, quite rightly, will not support any peace agreement. 
   In my view, monitoring from the high ground overlooking the Golan Heights is essential to achieving any agreement and to maintaining Israel's security. A largely automated equipment set should suffice, but if personnel are required on site, I think American contractors, not soldiers, can and should do the job. Operating on an isolated mountainside, they would be in more danger than are our peacekeepers in the Sinai Multilateral Force of Observers. This is an appropriate task for us. 
   Another potential cost, and one that is rarely mentioned, is economic assistance to Syria. The poverty and lack of economic dynamism in Syria is the fault of the Syrian regime, whose mania for control has largely smothered the entrepreneurial instinct of Syria's talented people. And, unsurprisingly in a regime which has ruled 
    unchallenged for 30 years, there is corruption. But if Syria will agree to a timetable of economic opening and a transition to democracy, U.S. economic aid for Syria would be appropriate. Syrians need to see a peace dividend. Given the business skills and ambition of Syrians, I expect a free-market, democratic Syria to move up quickly in global economic standings and to be a partner with Israel in trade as well as in security arrangements. 
   Lebanon poses perhaps the biggest challenge to a comprehensive peace. If Lebanon is to play a positive role in the peace process, and if Lebanon is to become independent of Syrian domination, many Lebanese are going to have to act with both courage and generosity. As Israel withdraws from southern Lebanon, Lebanese leaders should send their own rebuilt and united army to the south to disarm Hezbollah and the South Lebanese Army and to prevent future attacks on Israel. Lebanon should do this even if Syria objects. It is Lebanon's duty to be sovereign in all its territory, and to prevent attacks on other countries that emanate from Lebanese territory. I am sympathetic to all Lebanon has undergone over the past 25 years, but I am describing only the minimal duties of an independent state. 
   Occupying the south will take courage. Two other big problems--the future of the South Army and the future of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon--will require generosity. The Lebanese Army should integrate the SLA fighters into its own ranks and make them welcome. It should similarly integrate those Hezbollah combatants who request it. Regarding the Palestinians, some of whom have resided in camps in Lebanon since 1948, Lebanon should likewise be generous. Those Palestinians who request it should be accorded citizenship and Lebanon should make a special effort to integrate them fully into its national life. It seems presumptuous of me to advise a country which fought a long civil war over just such issues to now take bold action to integrate its marginalized groups. But if Lebanon fails to do so it will be neither peaceful nor independent, and its weakness will lessen the chances of peace in the region. 
   Let us suppose that this extraordinary long shot works, that all three balls go in their respective holes, and that Israel, Syria, and Lebanon, with American help, make a real peace. There will still be dangers emanating from the Middle East. The weapons of mass destruction now in the arsenals of Iran and Iraq, and the weapons those two states are still developing, present a lethal danger. The Iranian regime seems more rational and more amendable to democratic change than does Saddam's regime in Baghdad, but there won't be true security in the region until Iran and Iraq are free-market democracies and are fully integrated into the family of nations. 
   Furthermore, looming overall these security challenges is the biggest problem of the Middle East: The lack of water. Water is not a respecter of political boundaries; water shortages can only be solved on a regional basis, and if they are not solved diplomatically these shortages will be a longstanding source of military conflict. 
   Despite all of these challenges, it is still worthwhile for us to maintain our patience for peace. The peace we are helping build today will have enormous benefits. Perhaps the greatest benefit is that the burden of fear which overhangs the whole region will be lifted. I am thinking of the fear of a mother whose son has been drafted, the fear of a child in a bomb shelter, the fear that large crowds at a market or sports event might attract a terrorist bomb, the fear with which a family fits and adjust their gas masks, the fear of war that keeps investors away, the fear of the unknown alien race that lives in very similar circumstances just 30 miles away. 
   As many of my colleagues know, the people who deal with these fears are wonderful people. They are our friends, our actual relatives in many cases. For many of us they are our spiritual cousins as well, they are at home in a region many of us call holy, and they have lived with fear for too long. That is why one of our Government's noblest efforts right now is the effort to help the pragmatism, good sense, and good will of the region's leaders bring peace to the Middle East. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I thank Chairman LUGAR. He has done great work in allowing the process to come forward and allowing suggestions on how to improve crop insurance and make it more responsible. There has been some abuse of the program. Senator ROBERTS talked about it, and he has been a champion on that problem. We don't want a program that encourages people to farm for insurance rather than actually produce a crop. His suggestion to produce a program that gives people a variety of options that includes crop insurance, I think, is an improvement in the risk management offering to provide the farms and ranchers in the United States of America. 
   I also thank Senator LEAHY. I understand he spoke yesterday. In the Northeast, although there is only 2 percent of the farm land and 6 percent of the dollar value of crops produced on an annual basis, it is still important. There are farms in New Hampshire, Vermont, upstate New York, and New Jersey. They are concerned; they have expressed those concerns. We have taken their concerns into account. The House bill does not, I should point out to those from the Northeast. We have accommodated those concerns, unlike the House. You will see it if you look at the language of the legislation. 
   I thank Senator ROBERTS. It has been fun working with him. I think we have produced a piece of legislation that will provide producers with what they have been asking for, at least in Nebraska--the most important. 
   We have been blessed in the United States with a successful agriculture strategy over the last 100 years. But it has lulled us to sleep in many ways. 
   We are hoping to get an agreement on the bill. I ask my colleagues to take this opportunity to discuss agriculture in general. There are so many misconceptions about agriculture. It is seen as sort of an old policy. Agriculture is oftentimes seen as a special interest when, in fact, out of an $8 trillion economy, agriculture still accounts for a trillion dollars of that. Nearly 1 out of 8 jobs--almost 20 million jobs--in the United States are there as a consequence of the food and fiber grown on the farms and ranches of the United States of America. It is quite a remarkable success story. We take it for granted too often. 
   In this morning's New York Times there is an article by an economist by the name of Paul Krugman, talking about an issue that is quite hot: genetically modified organisms. Mr. Krugman, quite accurately, said that many of the opponents of GMOs are people who don't understand that it is the application of technology that has not only made our food better but made it affordable and relatively easy to acquire. It is almost nothing if you want to order the food that you can't get in relatively short order as a consequence not just of the way we produce food, but the way we distribute it, transport it, store it, and the way we process it. It is quite a remarkable success story and still accounts--even with declining sales internationally--for the most impressive part of our trade story. In fact, about the only good news right now in the trade story is we still have a slight surplus with agricultural exports. We tend as a consequence to take agriculture for granted and sort of see it as a marginal part of the economic debate. 
   Agricultural policy should be front and central to any economic strategy. Producing a trillion dollars in output and producing 20 million jobs is obviously significant to those of us who have portions of our economy dependent upon agriculture in our States, and it is obvious to us that it is a part of the new economy. The Senator from Indiana can talk eloquently about it because he still has an active farm. But you don't achieve success on a farm today without applying a significant amount of technology, without being a part of the new economy, without using computers, without being able to know exactly what your costs are, and without being able to know how to market and where the market is. There is almost nothing that is taken for granted today when it comes to production agriculture. 
   So it ought to be a central part of our economic strategy. 
   I know we attempted not just to accommodate but to take into account the concerns of States that don't have as much agriculture but are still important, such as the Northeast, where, as I said, it is only 2 percent of the agricultural land in production and 6 percent of the total dollar output; it is still important for a lot of reasons, both economic and social. As we try to figure out our economic strategy, it ought not to end up on some shopping list down there with a list of 30 or 40 things that people want to get done. 
   The unfortunate part of agriculture is that there is considerably more risk. That is what this legislation does. I want to talk about that risk because I get asked about this in urban environments in Nebraska, such as Omaha, Lincoln, Hastings, or some other smaller communities. Oftentimes, they say: Why do we have a special program? Why do we do crop insurance at all? Why do we have a Government-private sector partnership to help farmers manage risk? What makes them special or different than us? 
   There is an answer that may not be readily apparent, although it is quite obvious to those of us who are from States where there is an awful lot of production agriculture. The answer is, unlike all other manufacturing businesses, agriculture is at risk to the weather. I am in business. I have restaurants and health clubs. 
   In 1975, on the 6th of May, at about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, a tornado came up out of the Northwest. We had been in business a little over 2 years. The tornado blew us away; it completely destroyed our business. We had to start again from scratch. It happened in May, and we reopened 18 weeks later. We didn't even lose the 4 months sales we thought we were going to lose because we opened with greater volume. But if I am running DICK LUGAR's farm and a tornado comes through, it can take away not just 4 months' revenue but an entire year's revenue. 
   It is different. In my restaurant, I control the environment. I don't suffer declines as a consequence of drought, as we are currently experiencing in the State of Nebraska. I don't suffer as a consequence of all the different changes in the weather that can put the crop of a farmer or ranch unit at risk. So there is considerable risk, which is different than in other kinds of businesses. No other manufacturing business produces its product out of doors, and no other manufacturing business is at risk of losing an entire year's revenue as a result of too much water, too little water, rain, hail, and all the other sorts of things that can happen that cause a producer to lose an entire year's income. 
   In addition, very few businesses have the economic situation that agriculture does. That is to say, just a little more supply than what is necessary will cause prices to go down. It is just a slight more supply than is needed--if you produce, say, 15 or 20 percent more than what the market will absorb in a single year's time, the price will go down sharply. There is tremendous sensitivity to excess production. 
   In Mr. Krugman's excellent observation this morning in an op-ed piece in the New York Times, he said the very people who tend to oppose GMOs are the people who are least likely to be able to produce food on their own and who have benefited from the application of technology and the consequence of lower prices, greater quality, and greater accessibility to food. They have no difficulty getting food. They live in relatively wealthy nations, and they are not going to suffer as a consequence of not bringing the GMOs on line. It will be the poor, less developed  nations that will suffer the consequence. It is easy for Prince Charles to oppose GMOs. 
   We find ourselves in a short supply-and-demand situation where consumers are basically saying: We don't want our farmers and ranchers to produce less than what we want. We don't want to be short of food. We don't want prices to go up too high. We have a policy--it is especially true with large processors--where processors not only want prices to be stable but prefer prices to be in the lower range, if possible. That is always good business. You try to keep your costs under control. If we overproduce, the prices are always going to be on a downward pressure. 
   This legislation, the Risk Management for the 21st Century Act, allows the continuation of the development of products that are offered to farmers to manage the risks of price declines and revenue losses coming from changes in the market over which they have no control. 
   The Senator from North Dakota talked about currency fluctuations at great length when we discussed trade agreements and trying to get something in trade agreements that allow us to accommodate the sort of things that we saw after NAFTA with the peso decline. We found ourselves at a significant disadvantage as a consequence. These currency declines can have a tremendous impact on the earning ability of our farmers. It is a risk that the farmers of America have to manage. 
   In this new and improved crop insurance proposal, we will have an increased likelihood, in my view, that market-oriented products will enable a producer to manage the risk of loss of income due to unexpected and uncontrolled declines in their income associated with price declines. Also, those products will be developed and available to the market. Not only do we increase the subsidies and make it more likely that people will buy, but we also provide risk-minded options. We make changes in the existing crop program. Key among them is we restructure the risk management agency to make it more likely that products will be brought to market more quickly. It is more likely to be market-oriented as well. 
   My hope is that we can move this legislation--as Chairman LUGAR and Senator ROBERTS have indicated, and earlier Senator HARKIN spoke, and we could not have developed this piece of legislation without the distinguished ranking member as well--and pass a good, strong bill that is beneficial to all regions of the country so that it is more likely to come out of conference as a bill that is closer to what the Senate has. The House, as I said, does not have many of the provisions that the Northeastern Senators have been talking about. We did in ours. My hope is that we can pass this piece of legislation with a large influence and in a positive way for the conference.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I intend to vote for this piece of legislation. I think it is good and needed legislation. But I don't think anybody should be deluded as to why we are taking it up. 
   I remember the Boskin Commission. A number of years ago there was a question as to whether or not the CPI was overstating the actual cost of living for seniors who were eligible either for an old age, a survivor, or a disability payment. There was a question as to whether or not it was overstated. So we impaneled this commission to evaluate whether or not it was overstated. They came back and said, yes, it was overstated by a point, 1.1. 
   Out of 535 Members of Congress, maybe 20 people declared they were willing to vote for a 1.1-percentage reduction. If Boskin had come back and said it was understated by a point, there would have been 535 votes for it just like that. Nobody would have minded messing with the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nobody would have cited philosophy, et cetera. 
   We are a Congress that has been talking about Social Security reform, saving Social Security first. The President had a year's worth of discussions. We have been talking about this for several years now. It is not rocket science. Social Security is not a difficult problem to figure out. It is not like health care. Medicare is very complicated. Teenage violence is very complicated, as is the disintegration of the family. There are a lot of issues which are so complicated that it is hard to come up with an answer. But this one is not. 
   What happened is, from 1983 until approximately 12 months or so ago, the Social Security system was generating some assistance to us in reducing the size of our deficit. So when the Social Security transaction to purchase bonds occurred and the Treasury ended up with some cash, they used the proceeds to pay for general services of the Government. Very few people objected to that, so long as it was helping us. 
   Well, now we are into a surplus. All of a sudden you can't do that anymore. All of a sudden we find ourselves in a position to be able to take care of the earnings test. 
   I will make it clear. I am for ending the earnings test. The Senator from New York and I have a piece of legislation that will eliminate the earnings test all the way to 62. Our proposal brought a problem to the surface. This bill has not been heard by the Finance Committee. We have not considered some of the problems that may be created as a consequence of taking this action. 
   Members should understand that the earnings test isn't just a deduct. It is also an add-on to future benefits. That is why it doesn't cost us anything over 20. Over 10, it costs us $22 billion. Over 10 years, this proposal costs us $22 billion. If I came down and proposed a $22 billion add-on for Americans under the age of 5, there would be a budget point of order offered against it. But because it is for Americans over the age of 65, for some reason, there is silence on that point. 
   I can't quite figure it out. Maybe a colleague will be able to tell me why no budget point of order was filed against a proposal to spend $22 billion more on people over the age of 65, where there would be if one were to be filed on people under the age of 5. I am sure there is an explanation for it. I am not smart enough to be able to figure it out. 
   A consequence of this is going to be largely good. Under Social Security, we have an old age, a survivor, a disability, 
   and a medical benefit called Medicare and Medicaid. The old age benefit is the one to which we are referring. I believe Americans who are over the age of 65--that is who this affects. Eighty percent of all new beneficiaries take Social Security benefits at 62, 63, and 64. So this affects the 20 percent who wait until 65. They are going to have to measure whether or not this is going to be good for them. For most of them, it will be good. For most of them, they will be able to say: Well, I am not likely to be living long enough to benefit from the ``add-back'' that is going to occur later. So perhaps I am going to come out money ahead. 
   Again, understand that the earnings test doesn't only have a subtract. It adds back in future years. 
   One of the interesting things is, when we have proposed to eliminate the earnings test at 62, 63, and 64, some people have come forward and said that that could increase the number of women who are living in poverty because they are going to calculate that that add-back later on is more beneficial to them than the elimination of the earnings test at 62, 63 and 64. I don't know if that is going to happen for people age 65, 66, and 67. It may. There may be some for whom the earnings test is not a benefit. The committee hasn't heard it. 
   It is politically popular. It passed the House, I believe, unanimously. It will pass the Senate 100-0 as well. There will be nary a dissenting vote when it goes through the Senate. But it has not been heard by committee. It was heard by the Ways and Means Committee. It was not heard by the Finance Committee. It has a lot of political steam behind it. 
   This is a good thing to put on an add. This is a good thing to say you support. It is very difficult to be against this proposal. 
   I point out, again, we have not done comprehensive reform of Social Security. People under the age of 40 are going to pay a terrible price for that. We have an unprecedented demographic problem. It is not comparable to the problem the Senator from New York faced in 1983 when Social Security was fixed once before. The last time, we fixed Social Security for a number of reasons. The political environment has changed. I can't imagine enacting what was enacted in 1983, given the current political climate, which is essentially: I want to fix the problem, but I am against any increase in taxes or any cuts in benefits. If you can give me a good solution for Social Security that doesn't increase taxes or doesn't cut benefits, I am for it. 
   Otherwise, don't sign me up for anything. 
   Well, we would not have enacted the 1983 reforms if that was the standard we used to guide us. The problem we face in the future is not the same as the problem we faced in 1983. It is a demographic problem that is unprecedented in this country--a doubling of the number of beneficiaries. We are going to have a very steady increase in the number of people in the workforce of 7 or 8 million people working over the next 30 years, 40 million new beneficiaries. It is not likely that the baby boomers will come to Congress and ask for less. They are probably going to ask for more and say Boskin was wrong, that the CPI should be increased by two or three points because they have lots of things they want to buy. 
   Postponing this problem makes it difficult for us to stand before an audience of people under 40 and say we care about them, because they are going to face a tremendous problem. I heard the Senator from New York mention this change in the law that we had 2 years ago, where the Social Security Administration sent out a notice that wasn't accurate. They should have sent out one to everybody under 40 which said under current law you have a 33-percent cut in benefits heading your way. They did not disclose that. They presumed in that notice that Congress was going to increase the taxes by 50 percent. Well, I daresay if you came to the floor of the Senate now and offered an amendment to increase the payroll tax by a point, you would be lucky to get a half dozen votes. 
   I think this is a good piece of legislation. It is long overdue. The distinguished chairman described it accurately. I think, for the most part, it is going to be beneficial to people over the age of 65. Though I think there will unquestionably be some, as there would be 62, 63, and 64, who, as a consequence of not getting that add-back later on, may find themselves actually not being helped as much as we think.  I will support the underlying legislation and look forward at a later point in this debate to offering an amendment.

   Mr. KERREY. I am not sure I will take a full 30 minutes on my side. Let me describe the amendment first and see where it goes. 
   My amendment is essentially a conforming amendment. It is an amendment that conforms a change we are about to make with the change in the language relating to earnings that occur between age 65 and 69. 
   Senator MOYNIHAN and I have a proposal to eliminate the earnings test from 62 to 65. Some groups are opposed because they are concerned that for low-income working women there could be an increase in the number of women who are under the poverty guidelines as established by the Federal Government. It is an interesting fact. I am not sure of the validity of the forecast. 
   We are changing the program from a retirement program to an old-age program. I support that change. To change Social Security so that it is no longer a retirement-based program is very important. 
   Since 1935, we have either said to workers: You have to retire before you are eligible; or we have said: If you continue to work, there will be a penalty that will occur as a consequence of whatever earnings you have. 
   That is what we are trying to eliminate. 
   My amendment is a fairly simple, straightforward amendment. I don't know that I need to talk a great deal about it. It merely inserts language that makes it clear that full or semi-retirement is no longer required to collect benefits, that what is necessary is to merely meet a tested age--62, 63, 64, and on and on--and for those currently affected by the earnings test, for 65 through 69, there will no longer be a test of earnings and a deduct that will occur. 
   But, in addition to eliminating the earnings test, we are also fundamentally changing the old-age benefit part of the Social Security program, I believe in a way that is constructive, that will change the program from a retirement-based program to a program based on a test of age. 
   I am attempting with this amendment to merely bring the language of the law in conformance with what we will be doing with the underlying provision, which is to say you no longer have to retire and have little earned income in order to receive benefits. All  you have to do under this program is meet a test of age. That one dollar for three dollars--up to $17,000 of income--deferrment of benefits will no longer occur--from 65 to 69. 
   I support the underlying bill. This amendment will bring the language of the law in conformance to what the underlying bill does.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am going to speak until Senator ROBB gets down to the floor. 
   As I said earlier, I support the elimination of the earnings test from 65 to 69, and believe the amendment I have offered would be a positive conforming change that will make it clear, regarding Social Security at age 65, there is no longer a requirement to be retired. That is what the current law says, you have to be retired. ``Retirement benefit at normal retirement age'' is how it is described in the statute. My amendment would conform the changes we are making in H.R. 5 to alter the program that reduces benefits according to income from one that would no longer offer that reduction to beneficiaries. 
   Beneficiaries evaluate their income versus what Social Security is going to do all the time. One of the interesting things about the program is to observe that nearly 80 percent of beneficiaries take an early benefit. They have a 20-percent reduction in benefits. 
   The baby boomers may come in here 15 years from now and want to get rid of that, for all I know, but right now it is a 20-percent reduction in benefits. Mr. President, 80 percent of Americans, when they become eligible for the old age benefit, will opt to take that 20-percent reduction--not all of them are doing it at 62--some are taking a smaller cut in benefits at 63 or 64--because they calculate the benefits will be greater than retiring at 65 if they survive for 10 years. There is a lot of 
    thinking that goes on, including with the earnings test, the calculation of what the deduction will mean and what the add-back will provide in future years. 
   I would like to spend a little time again, until Senator ROBB gets down here, to talk about the underlying problem. The earnings test elimination bill, the legislation we are going to pass 100-0 tomorrow, does address one of the problems, though it only addresses it partially. It addresses the earnings test imposed from age 65 to 69. It does not address the earnings test imposed from age 62 to 64. But there are other problems that the status quo creates for future beneficiaries. We need to think about it that way. I would like to show my colleagues the ways delaying reform will cause future workers and beneficiaries to suffer. 
   The biggest problem with delaying reform is that it forces hard working, lower and middle class Americans to bear a disproportionate share of the burden of debt reduction--the same people who bore a disproportionate share of the great deficit reductions in 1980s and 1990s. People being paid by the hour are now being told we are going to use a significant portion of their FICA taxes--which are supposed to be dedicated to benefit payments--to pay down debt. That is basically what this phrase ``saving Social Security'' means when you examine it more closely. 
   It is true the debt will be nearly eliminated by 2013 if we use all of the surpluses to pay down debt--but then it goes right back up again in the 2020s to fund Social Security benefits for the baby boomers. So, if you are under the age of 15 today, when you become eligible you are looking at debt levels that will be somewhere between two and three times what they are today. So the do-nothing plan, taking no action at all--there are still 500 Members of Congress who have not signed onto a specific piece of legislation--results in a substantial increase in the debt out into the future. 
   The other thing that could happen in the future a consequence of this huge demographic bulge of baby boomers is a massive payroll tax increase or a cut in benefits. The baby boom generation will start retiring in 2010. There will be a 40-million-person increase in the number of beneficiaries from 37 to 77, but only a 7 or 8 million person increase in the number of people who are working. 
   Social Security is essentially a tax on people who are working, transferred in a progressive fashion to people who are eligible as a consequence of meeting a test of age, survivorship, or disability. It is a progressive transfer program. We have a trust fund that accumulates as a reserve against contingencies but it is a pay-as-you-go program. It is a tax that is transferred in a very progressive fashion. Indeed, that 12.4-percent tax today, along with the tax on income and the interest that is earned on the debt that is paid with income taxes, there is about $150 billion more--$550 billion of total income coming into the Social Security system this year against about $400 billion in checks that are written to pay for it. 
   That reserve builds up over time. I will not go into that particular problem, but anytime you have to convert any of those bonds, you have to use income taxes to convert the bond. Starting in about 2014, we will have to start drawing the trust funds down with additional infusions of income tax into the program. 
   What does this all mean for today's workers? If you are under the age of 40--there are approximately 150 million Americans under the age of 40--you are looking at the following problem: Congress will either have to reduce your benefits by 33 percent or Congress will have to enact a payroll tax increase of about 50 percent to accommodate the demand that will be there, the liability that will be there, under current law. 
   Obviously, a tax increase of that magnitude seems unacceptable. But this is what current law calls for. So if you are a Member of Congress that supports the do-nothing approach, you support a 33-percent cut in benefits or a 50-percent increase in taxes. 
   The reason I mention that is that with the plan I have introduced with Senator MOYNIHAN, the plan we have introduced with Senators BREAUX, GREGG, and ROBB, I have received a lot of attacks. People say: You are reducing benefits out in the future. How dare you reduce benefits out in the future, let alone suggest we need some additional revenue with tax increases? 
   None of the proposals out there have called for massive tax increases. Our proposal has a 2-percent reduction in the payroll tax, but it is funded with offsets in benefits out in the future, as well as increased benefits coming from the individual accounts--

   Mr. KERREY. Two percentage points, that is correct. Not 2 percent of the 12.4; but 2 percentage points overall, from 12.4 to 10.4 percent. Under current law, a substantial increase in the publicly-held debt will occur. 
   In addition, there is a problem with the existing program in that low-income-earning beneficiaries do not have enough of their income replaced by the current benefit formulas. The Social Security reform proposal that I have  introduced with a bipartisan group of Senators increases benefits for low income workers by changing these benefit formulas. 
   I hear lots of my colleagues, especially on this side of the aisle, talk a lot about the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. It is true that the gap is widening, but if you want to solve the problem, you cannot do it just by increasing the minimum wage or increasing the earned-income tax credit. You have to change the law so people of all incomes have the opportunity to generate wealth. The current Social Security program does not offer that opportunity. Our proposal would. 
   Finally, there is growing intergenerational inequity in our Federal budget. We may not be spending too much on people over age 65 today. But by the time I am eligible for Social Security, and the cohort coming right behind me--the baby boomers--in my view, we will be. 
   So colleagues understand, today if you take all Federal and State funding on people over the age of 65 and the people under the age of 18--that is State and Federal spending--we spend three times as much on people over age 65 as we do on people under the age of 18. 
   Again, I do not think it is too much today. I do not think we are spending an excessive amount today. But spending on seniors continues to increase. The year-to-year spending increases are getting larger. Again, nobody should suffer the illusion of where this money comes from. It comes from a tax on wages on today's workers. 
   If we underinvest in the skills and the training and the education of these kids, which in my view we are, in favor of politically popular moves that spend more and more money on people over the age of 65--and understand, there are 50 percent more Americans under the age of 18 than over the age of 65--if we continue to do that for very long, when we get to the year 2030 
    there will only be two workers per retiree. If I get to pick Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, I am in good shape. But I don't. I pick an average. One of the things we need to consider, as well, is the do-nothing plan is heading in a direction of creating, in my view, substantial intergenerational inequities in the Social Security program itself. 
   Social Security and Medicare are popular because they currently have some semblance of generational equity. People of all ages support Social Security and Medicare because they see them as a fair social contract. But in 10 or 15 years from now, my view is, looking at the numbers, and with there likely to be a decreasing number of young people, they are not going to have to be told by politicians, they are going to look at the contract and say: Wait a minute, this deal is not very good for me. They are not going to like it and will rise up and get angry about it. 
   For these reasons, I would argue that the status quo plan offered by the do-nothing caucus is dangerous. What we need is a comprehensive reform plan--that is bipartisan in nature--to finally fix the problems in the Social Security. 
   Obviously, the elimination of the earnings test is a very popular Social Security reform measure. The other ones are unpopular but require difficult votes in order to make the changes. I hope that we, at some point, are able to come together to solve the larger problem of Social Security that exists in all these different ways.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, my amendment is merely a conforming amendment. If you support the underlying amendment, which changes Social Security from a retirement program to a program that simply has a test of age as opposed to a status of work, I urge colleagues to make this change. It will make it a lot easier to do reform in the future. It has nothing to do with moving the eligibility age; that stays the same. The amendment substitutes the words ``old age'' and ``age test'' for the word ``retirement.'' So they will no longer be required to retire in order to be eligible for this benefit.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the question of how to write Federal laws and consider treaties that enable our armed forces and diplomats to protect and defend the people of the United States is both important and difficult for Members of Congress to answer. To write laws that keep America safe, we must evaluate today's threats and tomorrow's threats, we must consider the plans presented by our military to meet those threats, and we must be vigilant against the understandable tendency to want to withdraw from the world. We must remember those moments in our past when lack of preparation and planning resulted in terrible loss and then prepare to defend against threats we face. 
   We must also remember that freedom is not free, and that the price paid by  those men and women who choose to serve us in active, reserve, and National Guard duty is considerable. They serve the nation. They are not just in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, and the Coast Guard; they are in the United States Army, the United States Navy, the United States Air Force, the United States Marine Corps, and the United States Coast Guard. This is a real distinction with a real difference. 
   The difference is that United States forces do not just defend American shores. They defend liberty around the world. In the confused aftermath of the cold war, one thing should be abundantly clear: The fight for freedom is worth the price. From the end of the Vietnam War in 1975 to the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989 there was an active debate about the value and importance of this fight. However, the sight of tens of millions of men and women celebrating the end of a political system that denied them freedom thrilled even those grown cynical about the value of cold war expenditures. The intellectual debate about the value of communism ended when we saw and examined the destruction that was done by political tyranny. The human spirit was reduced and squandered. The air, the water, and the health of the people were sacrificed. Even the development of economic standards of living--long thought to be comparable to America's--were shockingly inferior. 
   Four times in my Senate career I have heard world leaders speak to joint sessions of the Congress to praise the price paid by America for their freedom. Duly elected as Presidents of newly freed people, each stood before us and spoke. Lech Walesa thanked us on behalf of the people of Poland. Nelson Mandela thanked us on behalf of the people of South Africa. Vaclav Havel thanked us on behalf of the people of Czechoslovakia. And Kim Dae Jung thanked us on behalf of the people of South Korea. Their message was simple: If the United States had not taken their side in the struggle for freedom, they would not have succeeded. 
   Certainly we have made mistakes. Our actions have not been free of treachery, deceit, and failure. Sometimes our actions have brought shame and disgrace. Yet, we should allow ourselves to learn and be guided by these failures. We cannot permit them to discourage us from continuing the work of writing laws that enable us to hold the ground we have won and to continue, most of all, the effort on behalf of others held captive by the world's remaining dictators or those who choose to terrorize us with their unlawful actions. 
   This rather long opening leads me to a simple discussion of just one of the questions we need to answer before we write the laws and negotiate the treaties that determine the nature, size, and shape of our defenses. The question is this: What nuclear force structure is needed to provide a minimal level of safety to the people of the United States? My intent in beginning this way is to make certain that I approach this question with the requisite seriousness to ensure that my answer will defend America rather than defending an ideology. 
   The person who has been given the authority to command our strategic nuclear forces lives at Offut Air Force Base adjacent to Bellevue, NE. As Commander in Chief of Strategic Forces--or STRATCOM--his responsibility is to carry out the orders and instructions given to him by the President through his Joint Chiefs of Staff. I have had the pleasure and honor of visiting STRATCOM on many occasions. On each of those occasions I have been briefed on the plans and mission of our strategic nuclear forces. On each of these occasions, I have left with pride and enthusiasm for the patriotism, energy, and talent of the men and women who serve at STRATCOM. On every occasion I have left with the impression that Americans are getting their money's worth from this effort. With this in mind, I think it is important to describe for the American people what STRATCOM is and what it does. 
   The mission of STRATCOM is simple, but it is also deadly serious. Their mission is to ``deter major military attack, and if deterrence fails, employ forces.'' In this effort, Adm. Richard Mies, the Commander of STRATCOM, controls the most effective and lethal set of armaments ever assembled by human beings: The strategic nuclear force of the United States of America. Yet, nearly a decade after the end of the cold war, many Americans no longer have an appreciation for the size and power of this force. I would like to take this opportunity to describe the force Admiral Mies controls. 
   First, America's strategic nuclear weapons are based on a triad of delivery systems: Land-based, sea-based, and strategic bombers. The U.S. relies on this triad to ensure credibility and survivability. Because our forces are diversified in this way, a potential enemy must recognize that, regardless of any hostile action, the United States would be able to retaliate with overwhelming force. 
   Currently, the U.S. has about 500 Minutemen III and 50 Peacekeeper missiles in the land-based arsenal. 
   While some of the Minuteman III missiles are being modified to accept single warheads, the bulk of these missiles are armed with three warheads. These warheads have a yield ranging from 170 to 335 kilotons. The 50 Peacekeeper missiles are each armed with 10 individually targetable warheads with a yield of 300 kilotons. In other words, our current land-based force alone can, upon an order and instruction from the President of the United States, deliver approximately 2,000 warheads to 2,000 targets on over 500 delivery vehicles with a total yield of about 550 megatons. 
   In itself, this is an awesome force. But it is only the beginning of what is available to U.S. military planners. At sea, we have 18 Ohio-class submarines. These are the ultimate in survivability, able to stay undetected at sea for long periods of time. As such, our submarine force must give pause to any potential aggressor. Eight of these boats carries 24 C-4 missiles. Each of these missiles are loaded with eight warheads with 100 kilotons of yield. The other 10 subs carry 24 of the updated D-5 missiles. These missiles are also equipped with eight warheads with varying degrees of yield from 100 to 475 kilotons. 
   This is close to 1,500 additional targets that we are able to hit accurately and rapidly, if the President of the United States merely gives the order--an awesome force, again, all by itself to be able to deter individuals or nation states from taking action against the United States. 
   The third leg of the triad, the strategic bomber force, includes both the B-2 and the B-52 bomber. These bombers have the capacity to carry 1,700 warheads via nuclear bombs and air-launched cruiser missiles. 
   Talking about this force, I use--and others do as well--words such as ``yield'' and ``kilotons'' or ``megatons.'' Unfortunately, most of these words to a lot of us have very little meaning. On previous occasions, I have come to the floor to describe what a single 100-kiloton weapon would do to one American city, the kind of destruction not just to that American city but to the American economy, as well as to the psyche of the American people who would, to put it mildly, be terrorized as a consequence of this single action. I don't want to recount that narrative today, but I do think it is important for us to try to put the power of these weapons in perspective. Oftentimes we don't. The numbers are so large and the weapons systems so numerous that we get dulled in our recognition of what they can do. 
   Let me use one example. On August 6, 1945, the Enola Gay dropped the first atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima. That and the subsequent bombing of Nagasaki ended World War II. Little Boy was the name of the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima. It destroyed 90 percent of the city. Instantly, 45,000 of this city's 250,000 inhabitants were killed. Within days, another 19,000 had died from the aftereffects of the bomb. This bomb had a yield of 15 kilotons. A 300-kiloton warhead such as can be found on top of our Peacekeeper missile is 20 times as powerful. We don't have in our strategic arsenal a weapon that is under 100 kilotons. Each of the 50 Peacekeeper missiles in our arsenal carries 10 of these 300-kiloton weapons. In all, Admiral Mies, under orders from the President of the United States, can deliver 6,000 strategic nuclear warheads with an approximate yield of over 1,800 megatons.  
   Mr. President, I think it is very important, as we debate what our nuclear weapons system needs to be, that we understand this concept and that we sort of take a map and use some common sense and try to evaluate what 6,000 nuclear weapons with over 100 kilotons of yield each could do to targets inside of our principal reason for deterrence, maintaining that arsenal, and that is Russia today. 
   I think common sense would cause us to pause and wonder whether or not we are keeping a level of weapons beyond what is necessary. 
   The purpose of this description is to give my colleagues a sense of this force and what this force could do if brought to bear by order of our Commander in Chief. I think it is fair for the American people to ask, first, what is the purpose of this force. According to the 2000 edition of the Secretary of Defense's Annual Report to the President and to Congress:  
   Nuclear forces remain a critical element of the U.S. policy of deterrence.  
   Simply put, the United States maintains its nuclear arsenal to guard against an attack from any potential weapons of mass destruction threat. I think it is important for us as well to examine these potential threats and ask if our current nuclear forces are structured to adequately address them. 
   As I see it, there are three main sources of threat for which we must maintain a nuclear deterrent. The first is the threat from rogue nations like Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. While the United States must remain vigilant in the effort to confront the weapons of mass destruction programs of these nations, there is no evidence that any of these countries currently possess nuclear weapons. Furthermore, it would be hard to justify the expenditure of approximately $25 billion a year to maintain an arsenal of over 6,000 warheads to defend against the threat posed by rogue nations. 
   If not rogue nations, what about China? While the threat from China has gotten a lot of attention lately, press accounts indicate the Chinese have no more than 20 land-based nuclear missiles capable of reaching the United States. Also according to the media, Chinese nuclear weapons are not kept on continual alert. Rather, nuclear warheads and liquid fuel tanks are stored separate from their missiles. It would take time for the Chinese to fuel, arm, and launch these weapons. Now, just one of these weapons would cause immense pain and devastation, but the likelihood of their use, accidental or intentional, is low. Once again, the maintenance of over 6,000 warheads is hardly justified by China's 20 missiles. 
   The only other threat that can justify our nuclear force levels is the Russian nuclear arsenal. But what is the current state of the Russian nuclear arsenal? 
   The Russian military relies on the same triad of delivery systems as we do. In their land-based arsenal, the Russians have approximately: 
   180 SS-18 missiles with 10 warheads at 550 kiloton yields each, 
   They have 160 SS-19 missiles with six warheads at 550 kiloton yields each. 
   They have 86 SS-24 missiles with 10 warheads at 550 kilotons yields each. 
   They have 360 SS-25 missiles with a single warhead each at 550 kiloton yield, and they have 
   10 SS-27 Topol M missiles with a single warhead at 550 kiloton yield. 
   This is obviously an impressive force. Any one of these weapons could devastate an American city or cities. But the Russians are finding that many of these missiles are nearing the end of the service-lives. And budgetary constraints have slowed the pace of acquisition of their latest land-based missile, the Topol M, to the point at which they are having trouble maintaining the numbers of weapons that will be allowed under the START treaties. 
   The collapse of the Russian economy, and the resulting strain on the Russian military budget, has also had disastrous consequences for the Russian Navy. Russia now has less than 30 operational nuclear-armed submarines. In fact, the slow op tempo of Russian submarines has meant that at certain times none of these boats are at sea. Regardless, reports indicate these subs maintain almost 350 nuclear delivery vehicles with more than 1,500 available warheads. 
   The Russian Air Force has also suffered. At the end of 1998, Russia had about 70 strategic bombers, but not all of these were operational. Estimates are Russian strategic bombers have about 800 warheads on both nuclear bombs and air launched cruise missiles. 
   Mr. President, the overall picture of the Russian arsenal force is that it is deadly, but it is decaying as well at an extremely rapid rate. Russian generals have said that they see a time in the near future when the Russian strategic arsenal will be measured not in thousands but in hundreds of weapons. It is this decay in the Russian arsenal which I believe poses the greatest threat to the United States and should encourage us to do more to find ways in which to achieve significant parallel nuclear reductions. 
   Some will argue that we have in the process already a way to achieve those reductions and it is called START. Yet even if START II is ratified by the Russian Duma, the United States and Russia would still have 3,500 nuclear warheads on each side at the end of 2007. We can't afford to wait over 7 years to make reductions that leave the Russians with still more weapons than they can control. 
   In response, some argue not to worry, START II is going to be quickly followed by START III. In discussions with the Russians on a possible START III treaty, the United States has told Russia that we are not willing to go below the 2,000- to 2,500-warhead threshold. This number is based on a 1997 study on U.S. minimum deterrence needs completed by the then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shalikashvili. 
   While I have no doubt that this report was professionally prepared and evaluated on criteria available at the time, I believe strongly it is time to redo this study. The current size of the United States and Russian nuclear arsenals is not based on any rational assessment of need; rather, it is a relic of the cold war. As the former commander of STRATCOM, Gen. Eugene Habiger, has said, ``The cold war was a unique war. And when the war ended, the loser really didn't lose. We still had this massive military might on both sides staring each other in the face.'' 
   As I have described the accuracy, diversity, and power of our nuclear arsenal, I find it difficult to argue that the men and women at STRATCOM will be able to accomplish their objective of deterring attack with far fewer weapons. I don't know what the magic number is for minimum deterrence, but given our cooperative relationship with Russia, given the fact Russia is about to hold its third democratic election for President, and given our conventional and intelligence capabilities, I am confident we can deter any aggressor with less than 6,000, or 3,500, or even 2,000 warheads. It is time we begin the process to come up with a realistic estimate of our deterrence needs. 
   As long as nuclear weapons remain a reality in this world, the men and women at STRATCOM will have a job to do in defending our Nation. Their contribution to our safety cannot be underestimated. But just as they have a responsibility, we have a responsibility to act in a way that will decrease the danger of nuclear weapons and increase the safety and security of the American people. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I want to call to the attention of my colleagues an issue that is not being raised in the otherwise informative presidential primary campaigns. It is not a theoretical issue, nor is it an issue concerning budgetary decisions. 
   Rather, it is an issue which sends American pilots on combat missions almost daily. It is an issue which throughout the last decade has cost the lives of hundreds of American and thousands of soldiers and civilians of other nationalities. It is an issue which threatens the peace and security of some of our closest allies, and which, if not solved, could threaten the United States with weapons of mass destruction. It is an issue which starves and hold captive twenty-two million people in conditions of unparalleled terror of their government. It is an issue which we have failed to deal with decisively, and that failure calls into question our dedication to the freedom we prize so highly for ourselves. 
   The issue is the continuing rule of Saddam Hussein. Nine years after the United States led a coalition to eject Iraqi forces and liberate Kuwait, Saddam continues to brutalize his people, threaten his neighbors, and develop weapons of mass destruction--earlier versions of which he used on neighboring states, on Israel, and on his own people. The good news is that sanctions have weakened his military, and his political support base has shrunk to his immediate family. All of mountainous northern Iraq and large swathes of southern Iraq are free of his control. Nonetheless, he continues to rule the central part of the country and, as Jim Hoagland pointed out in today's Washington Post, Saddam is likely to outlast yet another American President. 
   The Administration will no doubt point to the restraining effect UN sanctions have had on Saddam's ability to threaten his neighbors. In truth, his regime would have been far more aggressive if sanctions and the no-fly zones guaranteed by U.S. and British airpower had not been in effect. But in choosing policy options against an outlaw like Saddam, restraint is a minimal objective. 
   For example, we and our allies in the former Yugoslavia are not seeking to restrain those accused of war crimes during the ethnic war there; we seek to catch them, lock them up, and get them to The Hague for trial. Saddam has killed far more than any of the wanted Yugoslavs, and he keeps on killing today. Our rhetoric, including mine today, calls for the same response to Saddam. 
   But our real policy is merely to restrain him. The fact that the restraint has endured nine years is what the Administration shows as evidence of its success. But adhering to the policy of restraint is actually taking us farther from our stated goals. Support for the sanctions policy is eroding at the UN. This, along with rising oil prices and Iraq's rising oil production, have made Saddam a key global energy player once again. In addition, Saddam has had thirteen months to develop weapons of mass destruction without the inhibition imposed by outside inspections. Now, a new inspection regime has been voted by the Security Council. If Iraq eventually accepts it, I presume Dr. Blix and his new inspectors will do their best. Yet, they will never be as intrusive, and therefore as effective, as UNSCOM. In sum, the restraints which we have kept on Saddam for nine years are loosening. He is very close to being free of the handcuffs in which both we and his people have invested so much. 
   Restraining Saddam was always a minimal objective. It was a way to avoid the strategic risk many see in the bolder objective of acting in support of the Iraqi opposition to remove Saddam from power and achieve democracy. It is ironic that the minimal objective requires the continual application of U.S. military force, not just for a decade, but presumably forever. The bolder objective, once achieved, would bring U.S. military operations and basing in the Gulf countries to an end. I believe Congress has recognized the need for bold action. In passing the Iraq Liberation Act in October 1998, Congress expressed its frustration with the status quo and provided resources with which the Administration could support the Iraqi opposition in their efforts to remove Saddam from power. 
   In signing the Iraq Liberation Act, President Clinton affirmed that U.S. policy was not merely to restrain Saddam but to see him replaced. Unfortunately, the President's policy pronouncement has not been followed by action. The President and Vice President have encouraging words for Iraqis seeking to free their country, but their words are belied by the inaction of their Administration. Despite unprecedented unity, the Administration has provided only a small proportion of available resources to the Iraqi opposition, and this only on superficialities which will have no effect on opinion inside Iraq. The countries in the region all agree the U.S. is not serious about supporting Saddam's removal. If you don't believe me, call the ambassador of any Middle Eastern country and ask him or her if our actions and rhetoric match. 
   If the Administration actively sought Saddam's replacement, our allies in the region would know it and they would cooperate with us. But the Administration has not asked because the  truth is, beneath the rhetoric, we are clinging to the old policy of restraining Saddam. There are now signs that the consensus for even that is fraying. I would hate to think that the boldest hope of our national security establishment is that our policy will hold until noon on January 20 of 2001. 
   I admit to coming late to an understanding of the evil of the Iraqi regime and the imperative of fighting it. After Saddam's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, I voted against the Gulf War resolution. My distrust of the Bush Administration's statements regarding the need for the use of force in Iraq were colored by my own experiences in Vietnam. But Iraq is not Vietnam. And I have come to understand the brutality of Saddam Hussein's regime and the overwhelming requirement to support the efforts of Iraqis to replace it. I understand the threat the regime poses to his people, to his neighbors, and to the rest of the world. Most of all, this is about our commitment to freedom. 
   The long night of the Iraqi people will not be ended through a policy of merely retraining the Iraqi regime. Instead, we must work to match our words and our deeds to actively support the Iraqi opposition in their effort to remove Saddam Hussein and establish a democratic Iraq. When the people of Iraq obtain their freedom, it will transform the Middle East. It will create a new region in which brutality, poverty, and unnecessary armaments will be supplanted by security, prosperity, and creative diversity. 
   Mr. President, this goal is within our reach. But the difference between success and failure in this endeavor will be measured by our willingness to act in support of the people of Iraq. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, a few weeks ago, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger joined what has become a chorus of distinguished citizens and representatives who are suggesting the decision to deploy the national missile defense system be postponed until after the November 7 Presidential election. Although it may be that a delay is necessitated for other reasons, I hope we do not allow the approach of a Presidential election to prevent us from making important foreign policy decisions. 
   Not only do I believe this to be a precedent which would hamper future Presidential decisionmaking, but it also ignores the fact that this is a tough decision for any President to make anytime, regardless of the circumstances. It also ignores that it takes time for a new Commander in Chief at the helm of the ship to get his or her foreign policy sea legs. Such a delay could jeopardize our capacity to deploy NMD in a timely fashion. 
   In his argument, Secretary Kissinger referred to ``congressionally imposed deadline.'' This is a commonly made mistake about what Congress did last year. All we called for was deployment of national missile defense ``as soon as it is technologically possible.'' The administration has said this decision could be made as early as June and has recently indicated this could slip to late summer. 
   Of the four criteria that will be used by President Clinton to make his decision, the most difficult to quantify is the impact on other arms control agreements. Specifically, the impact most feared is that deployment of this missile defense system would be regarded by the Russians as a violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. 
   While I can make a very strong argument that deployment of NMD is permitted under the terms of this treaty, this argument will diminish in importance if the Russian Government abrogates other treaties by modifying their strategic nuclear weapons. This includes the very real and destabilizing prospect of re-MIRVing their missiles or converting single-warhead missiles to multiwarhead missiles. This is why the United States is attempting, and thus far without success, to persuade Russia to allow a modification of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in order to build NMD and avoid potentially serious conflict between the United States and the Russian Government. We have met considerable resistance, not only from the Russians but also from allies who regard our analysis of the ballistic missile threat to be flawed. 
   To be clear, the new threat is real. We cannot afford to ignore the real threat that an accidental or rogue nation launch of ballistic missiles carrying nuclear weapons poses to the survival of our Nation. The need to build this defensive system, which is still being tested for feasibility and reliability, derives from the national intelligence estimate and an external panel headed by Donald Rumsfeld. Both have concluded that the threat of rogue nation or unauthorized launch of a nuclear, biological, or chemical weapon at the United States of America is real. 
   As a consequence, we have begun testing a system which would protect Americans against this threat. A test schedule for May will be critically important to demonstrate feasibility and reliability, one of the four Presidential conditions needed for deployment. Given the risk/reward ratio of defending 
   against nuclear weapons, the current cost estimates over 10 years of an amount that is less than 1 percent of our national defense budget and the unlikely reassessment of this threat, all that would stand in the way of a Presidential decision to deploy would be the potential adverse impact on other agreements. 
   The President will face this question: Will a decision to deploy NMD result in other nations, especially Russia, reacting in a manner that would produce a net increase in proliferation activity and thus increase the potential for rogue or unauthorized launch of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons? 
   We are more likely to resolve this potential conflict in a way that increases the safety and security of Americans if President Clinton does not delay the decision until after the November 7 election. This is a decision that should be made on the basis of the current facts and the four criteria for deployment previously outlined by the administration. 
   To be successful, we should also consider an alternative negotiating strategy that would pose a win-win for both the United States and Russia. It would reduce the threat of weapons of mass destruction. It would improve the relations between the United States and Russia. And it would enable the United States to redirect money from maintaining our current nuclear weapons stockpile to our conventional forces, where a real strain can be seen in recruitment, readiness, and capability. 
   To spur constructive action, we must force ourselves to remember this grim truth: The only thing capable of killing every man, woman, and child in the United States of America is the Russian nuclear stockpile. We must remember the threat no longer comes from a deliberate attack. Instead, these weapons now present two new and very dangerous threats. 
   The first is the possibility of an accidental or unauthorized launch of a Russian nuclear weapon. During the cold war, we worried about the military might of the Soviet Union, but today we worry about the military weakness of Russia and her ever-decreasing ability to control the over 6,000 strategic nuclear warheads in her arsenal. There are numerous stories that have emerged out of Russia over the past few years highlighting the vulnerability of these weapons. There are stories of major security breaches at sensitive nuclear facilities. There are stories of unpaid Russian soldiers attempting to sell nuclear-related material in order to feed their families. And there are stories of the continuing decay of the command and control infrastructure needed to maintain the nuclear arsenal of Russia. Each of these demonstrates the vulnerability of the Russian arsenal to an accidental launch based on a technical error or miscalculation or the unauthorized use of a weapon by a rogue group or disgruntled individual.  
   The second threat posed by the nuclear legacy of the cold war is the danger of the proliferation of material, technology, or expertise. Consider just the case of North Korea. Last summer, North Korea held the world's attention as a result of indications that they were preparing to test a long-range Taepo Dong ballistic missile. Through skillful diplomacy, the United States was able to convince the North Koreans to halt their missile testing program. 
   However, the stability of the entire east Asian region was in jeopardy as a result of the possibility of such a test. North Korea is one of the most backward countries in the world. It is a country where millions of its own citizens have starved to death. Yet this country was able to affect the actions of the United States, Japan, and China as a result of their ability to modify what is, in truth, outdated Soviet missile technology. As has been indicated publicly, the Taepo Dong is little more than a longer range version of the 1950s Soviet Scud missile. 
   One can only imagine the consequences to our security if North Korea had a nuclear capability and the means to deliver it. But this illustrates the threat posed by proliferation. Without real management of these materials and technology--much of it Russian in origin--it will become easier for third and fourth rate powers to drastically affect our own security decisions. 
   Both of these threats--accidental or unauthorized launch and proliferation of these weapons to rogue nations--present a new challenge to the United States. It is a challenge very different from the cold war standoff of two nuclear superpowers. Classic deterrence, better known as mutual assured destruction, was the bedrock of our policy to confront nuclear threats during the cold war. Mutual assured destruction was based on the premise that our enemies would not dare to attack the United States as long as they knew that such an attack would be met with an overwhelming, deadly response by the United States. This theory, however, provides no safety from an accidental launch caused by the failure of outdated technology. It provides no safety net from the use of these weapons by a terrorist state whose only objective is the death of as many Americans as possible. 
   We need to develop a completely new and comprehensive approach to confront these threats. National missile defense will not add to our security if it is built as a stand alone venture. As part of a comprehensive approach it most assuredly can. To succeed, we should work with Russia to develop a new strategic partnership. We need a partnership based on cooperation, not confrontation--a partnership that builds on the many areas of mutual concern, not those that divide--a partnership that recognizes the nuclear legacy of the cold war threatens all of us, and that only by working together can we truly reduce this threat. 
   The possibility of a new approach where our interests intersect with those of Russia can be seen in a proposal made by Russia to our arms control negotiators in Geneva. The Russians offered to reduce the number of strategic nuclear warheads to 1,500 on each side. We rejected the offer based on an assessment of minimum deterrence levels that are 500 to 1,000 strategic warheads higher. But this assessment has been overtaken by events in Russia which now make it likely the Russians will be unable to safely maintain more than a few hundred of their own nuclear weapons. 
   As the Russian capability to maintain their stockpile dwindles, it is natural to assume our threshold for deterrence will also significantly decrease. Thus, by keeping more weapons than we need to defend our national interests, we are encouraging the Russians to maintain more weapons than they are able to control. The net effect is to increase the danger of the proliferation or accidental use of these deadly weapons which decreases the effectiveness of national missile defense. 
   So, here is the outline of a win-win proposal to the 
   Russians. We jointly agree to make dramatic reductions in the U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenal. We jointly agree that national missile defense is an essential part of a strategy to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons. And, we jointly agree that parallel reductions in our nuclear forces must include arrangements--and a Congressional commitment to provide funding--to secure and manage the resultant nuclear material. 
   We are fortunate that we will not begin from scratch on this problem. We can build upon one of the greatest acts of post-cold war statesmanship: the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. To facilitate these dramatic reductions, we must look for ways to expand upon the success of this program, to enlist new international partners, and to work with the Russians to find new solutions to the problems of securing nuclear material. Additionally, we should continue our lab-to-lab efforts that are assisting the transition of Russian nuclear facilities and workers from military to civilian purposes. These are the practical, on the ground programs that will help us reduce the chance of the proliferation of nuclear materials and know-how. 
   In exchange for deep nuclear reductions and technical assistance, the Russians would agree to changes in the ABM Treaty. With this alternative, the President would not have to choose between national missile defense and future cooperation with Russia. Instead, by working in cooperation with Russia on a comprehensive basis, we will be able to deploy a limited NMD system designed to protect the United States from accidental or rogue state ballistic missile launches. 
   We can reach such an agreement with Russia because the Russian people now know they are not immune from the threats of extremism. Their security is also endangered by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to terrorists and rogue states. This now presents us with an opportunity to begin to work with Russia diplomatically to confront this emerging threat from countries like North Korea, Iran, and Iraq. Former Secretary of Defense William Perry's success in halting North Korea's missile testing program highlights the potential power of diplomacy to reduce these threats. But by developing a strategic partnership with Russia, and working cooperatively to bring change in North Korea, to end Saddam Hussein's brutal regime, or to foster real reform in Iran, we will reduce nuclear dangers and create a safer world. 
   So as President Clinton considers his decision about NMD, I hope he considers an alternative strategy that embraces a comprehensive approach to the threats we face in today's world. Now is the time to reach out to Russia and to create a partnership that will build the basis for securing the post-cold war peace for our children. 
   Mr. President, in the aftermath of the administration's rejection of the offer to substantially reduce strategic weapons, the issue of a previous analysis of the minimum deterrence done by then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shalikashvili, was raised. I say to my colleagues, I intend to read carefully that report and revisit the floor with an opportunity to discuss what I believe is a rational minimum deterrence level necessary to protect the people of the United States of America. Obviously, that must be a concern of ours as well. 
   But I believe there is a historic opportunity. It will be difficult for us to seize that opportunity if Republicans and Democrats do not agree that still the most important thing for all of us to do is to make certain the safety and security of the American people are secured through not only our policies but our active efforts. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my sadness at the death of Senator Carl T. Curtis. 
   Senator Curtis was a lifelong public servant best known for his untiring work on behalf of the people of Nebraska. He began his public career in 1930 when he was elected Kearney County Attorney. After failing to be re-elected as county attorney--the only political defeat he would ever face--he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1938. The people of Nebraska returned Carl Curtis to the House of Representatives for an additional seven terms. 
   In 1954, he chose to leave the House and to return to private life. But when then-Senator Dwight Griswold died in office, Carl Curtis was coaxed into further public service. He was overwhelmingly elected to the United States Senate and served as a distinguished member of this body until his retirement from public office in 1979.  
   Mr. President, Senator Curtis brought to the Senate the plain-spoken common sense of rural Nebraska. He understood his roots and he cared deeply for the people he represented. While his style did not lend itself to self-promotion and banner headlines, his influence in Congress was felt on a number of important issues. He was instrumental in shaping tax and agricultural policy, he was a staunch advocate of budgetary discipline, and he was a fervent defender of his political party. Yet, Senator Curtis was most well known for his dedication to the people of Nebraska. As many have noted, Senator Curtis set the standard for constituent service. He often dedicated hours of his personal time to helping individuals and his office was always open to Nebraskans visiting the nation's capital. 
   As the longest serving Member of Congress in Nebraska history, Senator Curtis established a legacy of service unlikely to be matched. After retiring from Congress, Senator Curtis returned to the practice of law and always remained an active participant in Nebraska politics. 
   While Nebraska has lost a statesman, the Curtis family has lost a husband, a father, a grandfather, and a great grandfather. I know my colleagues will join with me in expressing our sincerest condolences to the family of Senator Carl T. Curtis.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to join Chairman SHELBY in urging my colleagues to vote in favor of the intelligence authorization conference report. This report is a culmination of the lengthy effort to fund intelligence activities for fiscal year 2000. It has not been easy to arrive at this point because the committee had to address many significant nonintelligence issues ranging from the reorganization of the Department of Energy to the establishment of procedures for blocking the assets of drug kingpins. We have arrived at this point because we have reached several important compromises with our House colleagues, and the report deserves the Senate's full support. 
   This conference report supports many new initiatives. In my view, one of the most important new initiatives is to make the year 2000 a watershed year for intelligence. The watershed represents a turnaround in spending on intelligence activities. I believe it is time to increase spending because we now have a much better understanding  of the threats facing the United States of America and the important role intelligence plays in meeting those threats. 
   One of the most difficult parts of my job as the Intelligence Committee vice chairman has been to talk to people about the importance of intelligence. This job is difficult because most of the information is classified. Therefore, public debate on the condition of the intelligence community is extremely rare and discussing funding levels is almost impossible. 
   My colleagues are well aware that classified conference reports and the classified schedules of authorizations are available for their review in S. 407 but you have to go there to get the details. We cannot talk about them now. 
   Let me say, however, intelligence is stretched very thin. Our global reach is supported by intelligence as global coverage. Without adequate coverage, we make policy mistakes. 
   The Intelligence Community is stretched thin in trying to meet all of its commitments to policy makers. But I can't tell you on the floor of the Senate how thin it is stretched, and I can't tell you how much it's going to cost to fix. I can only tell you I'm glad fiscal year 2000 is a watershed year for intelligence. 
   A second initiative this bill supports is striking the balance between intelligence collection and the subsequent exploitation and dissemination of the information collected. My colleagues should know that one of the problems of insufficient funding is that the Intelligence Community is unable properly to exploit and disseminate all of the information it gathers. If you think about it, this may seem odd. That is, the Community is collecting more information than it is able to analyze and deliver to its customers. But it is not odd. Among other things, it reflects constrained Intelligence budgets. As the Community has moved into advanced technologies, it has invested in the future by developing new intelligence collection systems. The idea was that by the time these new systems were ready to be used, we would have been able to find the funding to exploit and disseminate the information being collected. Well the future is now, and we haven't been able to find the funding to balance collection, exploitation, and dissemination. In this bill we have confronted the issue and proposed important solutions. Again, I urge my colleagues to read the classified report in S-407 in order to get the details. 
   Another important provision in this bill is the creation of a National Commission for the review of the National Reconnaissance Office. Mr. President, the NRO is a national treasure. They acquire and operate the nation's space reconnaissance satellites--the so-called spy satellites. They have a long and proud history of being on the leading edge of technology so that our nation's leaders could be better informed about our adversaries. We all got a glimpse at their extraordinary abilities when the Corona spy satellite imagery was released to the public. It is literally an eye-opening experience to be able to see now what our President was able to see years ago about the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War. This is the type of effort we have come to expect from NRO. 
   But the NRO has come under public attack in the recent past. Unfavorable news accounts have caused some to be unsure about the NRO and the path it is following. Others have questioned whether the NRO should remain an agency resting somewhere between the authorities of the Director of Central Intelligence and the Secretary of Defense. Moreover, the end of the Cold War has altered forever the nature of the threats we face. New threats mean a changed emphasis for intelligence. Furthermore, the explosion of information technology has created new opportunities for the collection and the delivery of intelligence. Thus, the Conferees decided there is a need to evaluate the NRO's roles and missions, organizational structure, technical skills, contractor relationships, uses of commercial satellite imagery, acquisition authorities, and its relationships to other agencies and departments of the Federal Government in order to assure continuing success in satellite reconnaissance. I look forward to the Commission's work. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I would like to comment briefly on the ``Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act'' contained in the conference report. This is a significant piece of legislation intended to attack drug traffickers at the heart by blocking all of their assets either within the United States or that are under U.S. control. It establishes a procedure for the President of the United States to publicly identify drug kingpins and to block the kingpin's assets. As my colleagues may recall, a similar provision sponsored by Senators COVERDELL and FEINSTEIN was accepted as an amendment to the Intelligence Authorization Bill during floor action. 
   As I mentioned at the beginning of my statement, this provision has made the Intelligence Conference extremely interesting. Several of us joined the Chairman in being concerned about the right of judicial review for U.S. persons whose assets could be seized as a result of being involved in a joint venture with someone later identified as a drug kingpin. This was a matter of debate during discussions leading to the conference meeting and was addressed during the conference. The House Conferees argued strenuously for their vision of the legislation which passed the House by a vote of 385 to 26. Further, the Administration supported the House version. Nonetheless, Chairman SHELBY and several of us remained concerned about due process being afforded to those who might unwittingly get caught up in the kingpin designation and subsequent blocking of assets. 
   The Conference agreed the concerns were of sufficient merit to warrant the appointment of a special judicial review panel to evaluate these concerns and report its findings. The commission is charged with the responsibility of reviewing judicial, regulatory, and administrative authorities relating to the blocking of assets. It also is to report on its evaluation of the remedies available to U.S. persons affected by the Government's blocking of assets of foreign persons. I believe their detailed and extended evaluation will provide the Congress insights into both the complexities of the Drug Kingpin legislation contained in the Intelligence Conference Report and the consequences to American persons when the assets of foreign persons are blocked under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. 
   In conclusion, Mr. President, I would like to note this is my last Conference Report as the committee's Vice Chairman. My term on the Committee expires toward the end of January 2000. I have had the privilege of serving under highly distinguished Chairmen and Vice Chairmen: DAVID BOREN, FRANK MURKOWSKI, DENNIS DECONCINI, JOHN WARNER, ARLEN SPECTER, and RICHARD SHELBY. In every instance, I have experienced a commitment to a bipartisan approach to intelligence. 
   Throughout my time on the Committee, the members always have treated intelligence activities and intelligence policy as serious issues deserving their close attention. Because the issues have always been treated very seriously, committee members have had disagreements. But, Mr. President, in the end we always found a bipartisan answer to our differences. Bipartisanship has been a hallmark of the committee because intelligence is not a partisan issue. If it ever should become a partisan issue, I believe we can look forward to a consequent politicization of intelligence. 
   This can be very bad for Congress and even worse for the country. 
   Again, I thank Chairman SHELBY for his leadership in delivering the conference report to the floor and for his commitment to finding bipartisan answers to some very complex questions. I look forward to the opportunity in the future to speak more fully on the floor concerning intelligence and its values. 
   Lastly, I call to my colleagues' attention and to the attention of the American people that the intelligence community is full of highly dedicated men and women who are working under some of the most difficult of circumstances. Their professionalism, their patriotism knows no bounds, and I salute them for their excellent work. Being the committee vice chairman has, indeed, been a great privilege. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I would like to rectify some information entered into the RECORD during the debate on the Bankruptcy Reform Bill on November 5, 1999. 
   A comprehensive bankruptcy study was cited during the course of debate. This study was conducted by Professors Marianne Culhane and Michaela White from Creighton University, an impressive institution of higher learning in my home State of Nebraska. 
   When discussing this study, my colleague from Iowa referred to a GAO Report that reviewed four different bankruptcy studies, including the one written by Professors Culhane and White. It is my understanding some comments were made indicating that GAO challenged the methodology the Creighton professors used in conducting this study. After reviewing the GAO Report, that was not my understanding. In fact, the GAO Report specifically says, ``In our review, we found that the Creighton/ABI researchers prepared and analyzed their data in a careful, thorough manner.''

    Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to give privately owned, over-the-road bus operators, the assistance they need to equip their buses with wheelchair lifts. These operators provide vital intercity bus services to millions of Americans who have access to no other form of public transportation, most particularly in rural areas. The legislation I am introducing today passed the Senate earlier this year as part of a larger tax bill and enjoyed bipartisan support. Indeed I am delighted that Senator GRASSLEY has agreed to join me as a cosponsor of this bill. 
   In keeping with the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Department of Transportation (DOT) is requiring that a wheelchair lift be installed on every new over-the-road bus operating intercity bus service. In addition, comparable requirements are being imposed on over the road buses providing charter service. This largely unfunded mandate is estimated to cost the industry $25 million a year in acquisition and training costs alone. In some years, that $25 million figure is expected to exceed the entire profit for the industry. 
   DOT's new requirement serves the important public purpose of ensuring that disabled persons in wheelchairs will have access to over-the-road buses. Yet the cost of this requirement poses a significant threat to the continuation of this service for millions of rural and low-income Americans. Over-the-road buses serve roughly 4,000 communities that have no other form of intercity public transportation. Additionally, with an average fare of $34, they are the only form of affordable transportation available for millions of passengers. 
   The legislation we are introducing today provides over-the-road bus operators with a 50-percent tax credit for the unsubsidized costs of complying with the DOT requirement. This tax credit gives them the support that they need to ensure both that disabled people in wheelchairs have access to over-the-road bus service and that that service remains available to the millions of passengers who rely on that service. 
   I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation. 
   By Mr. BROWNBACK.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the bankruptcy bill. I have supported a number of amendments to it. I believe this bill does achieve a balance between society's interest of people paying their debts and preventing debtors from being permanently ruined. 
   Senator GRASSLEY and Senator TORRICELLI have made a good-faith effort to strike that balance. I am an original cosponsor of the bill. I supported some reasonable changes that will improve the bill. If those changes are adopted by a majority of the Senate, I intend to support final passage of what I consider to be a very important piece of legislation that will make certain people don't take undue advantage of the bankruptcy laws, especially those who can reasonably be expected to pay at least part of their debts. These individuals are not excused entirely. That is, in essence, what Senator GRASSLEY and Senator TORRICELLI have attempted to do. I believe they have struck a fair balance and gotten that done. 
   I understand this is the last legislative vehicle heading, hopefully, toward the President's signature. 
   I want to speak about the methamphetamine amendment that has been offered that we will vote on relatively soon. Staff has advised me I should vote for it, that I should not be seen as being weak on fighting the battle against methamphetamines. I have come to the floor and I wish the author of this amendment were on the floor to ask him, why shouldn't I be angry that this amendment has been converted from a good piece of legislation that would provide additional resources, that would give additional resources to our DEA agents to enable law enforcement to fight in Nebraska the battle against methamphetamines? That is what we are trying to do. 
   I have worked with almost every single sheriff, almost every single law enforcement officer--whether chief of police or the head of our highway patrol--trying to win this battle, and we are not winning it. We have the juvenile justice bill tied up in conference; why don't we pass it? Because we can't reach agreement on how to regulate gun ownership. It provides additional resources to win this battle, to enable us to say we are doing all we can to keep our kids safe against a drug that will destroy their lives. 
   What do we have before the Senate? An amendment that has a school voucher proposal in it. I hear from my judges, from my law enforcement officers, that the net effect of the changes in the penalties on crack and powder cocaine, to increase the penalty to the mandatory minimum on powder cocaine, will be we divert more resources from fighting the battle on dealers and high-level drug usage to fighting the battle against those individuals using cocaine occasionally or on a one-time basis. We will be arresting and putting college kids in jail. That is what we will be doing. 
   I am angry we have interfered with a good faith effort. The underlying provisions of this methamphetamine bill I find to be attractive with the urgency of this problem. In Nebraska, we started this 5 or 6 years ago when the problem of methamphetamine first came to light. We devoted more resources as part of the HIDTA--High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area--effort, part of the multiagency effort. Law enforcement people say they are starting to get this under control; they are making more arrests; they are putting people away. The tougher penalties in here I support because we need to have tougher penalties in place. They say they are getting the job done, but all of a sudden we are playing politics with it again. 
   I favor the underlying methamphetamine effort that is in this amendment. But to attach a school voucher proposal to it and additional mandatory minimums that will redirect resources away from the real serious problems in my community is offensive to me personally. Not only will I vote against it, I intend to write a letter to every law enforcement officer in Nebraska and say to them, they also should be angry. We haven't passed the Juvenile Justice Act. We are not providing resources necessary to solve this problem, and we are playing politics, worst of all, trying to seek advantage, trying to put an amendment up that is difficult to vote against. 
   It won't be difficult for me to vote against this amendment. I am sad that is what I have to do because we are playing politics rather than trying to actually provide our law enforcement officers with the resources they need to solve what has become in Nebraska one of my most difficult law enforcement problems to solve. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I join the distinguished Senator from Tennessee and the distinguished Senator from Louisiana in introducing this legislation. I want to emphasize something both Senators emphasized in an earlier press conference, and that is, the goal of this legislation has three parts: No. 1 is security, securing Medicare for beneficiaries today and beneficiaries in the future. It is a terribly important program, and the roughly 40 million Americans who currently benefit from this program need to know the law guarantees their benefits. This proposal actually secures their benefits even more than existing law. 
   Some people will attack this proposal, but we have been very careful in drafting this legislation to accommodate the beneficiaries' concerns that their benefits under a competitive model might be lower. This legislation says their benefits cannot be less than what is currently available under existing law, and there is, I say to those who are concerned about rural communities, as I know the distinguished occupant of the Chair is, there is a provision in here that says if competition does not bring alternative plans, plans other than the fee-for-service offering of the Health Care Finance Administration, that the cost to the beneficiaries cannot exceed 12 percent of the national weighted average. That would make it very likely that in rural areas there will be no penalty; indeed, it is likely to be they will be paying less than they do under the current law. 
   The second is that it is comprehensive and it offers comprehensive choice. There is a very important part of this legislation that, almost all by itself, is going to increase the satisfaction of citizens as they examine Medicare. That is, we establish a public board that has significant power not just over HCFA but over the plans that are offered in the marketplace. 
   Right now, HCFA writes the rules for competing plans; obviously, a conflict of interest. We do not want to decrease the ability of HCFA to offer plans. We have written this so HCFA can offer its fee-for-service plan and be competitive, but we want this board to set the rules and conditions under which competitive plans come into the marketplace, although we have written in the legislation guarantees, as I indicated earlier, to make certain the program is secure. 
   A public board is much more likely to give the public satisfaction than the current environment. All of us understand it is exceptionally difficult both to evaluate what is right and what is wrong when we are faced with a request from a provider or from a beneficiary, and it is even more difficult to  get HCFA to change its rules mostly on account of HCFA knowing that if it changes a rule, for example, in Nebraska, it is going to be changing rules for all other 49 States as well and could add significant costs to the program. So HCFA ends up being very inflexible, I argue not through any fault of its own but through the fault of the way the law is written. 
   The second objective of this legislation is that we provide comprehensive choice in a new legal environment, where the citizens will have more opportunity to make their case to a public board and the public board will have much greater expertise in making decisions about how to create a competitive environment that will enable HCFA to compete as well as private sector companies to come on line and offer more choice at lower cost to beneficiaries. 
   The third thing is we say that a prescription benefit should and must be considered in a comprehensive solution with Medicare reform. We cannot separate it. You cannot take a prescription benefit for a Medicare beneficiary and separate it and create an entirely new program without considering the need for comprehensive change in the program. It is much more likely that we will satisfy concerns of taxpayers that we not end up with a program that has an open-ended cost to it and much more likely, especially with the structural change of the board, that the rules will be written so 
   the marketplace cannot only develop affordable products, but develop creative products that we are apt to see increasingly being asked for by our health care delivery system. 
   I am very pleased to be a cosponsor of this legislation. I hope we are able to get a markup in the Senate Finance Committee next year. I hope this becomes the basis for bipartisan reform. All too often this is a subject matter that lends itself to demagoging on both sides. Mediscare has become a verb and a form of political art. Hopefully, as a consequence of it beginning in a bipartisan fashion, it will end up in a bipartisan fashion, and the rhetoric will be much more tame and much more honest as well.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, there were eight other questions on the financial side. 
   Question No. 2: Does it reduce the national debt? 
   Question No. 3: Does it reduce the cost of Social Security as a percent of GDP? 
   Question No. 4: Does it increase national savings? 
   Question 5: Does it solve the 75-year actuarial solvency problem? In other words, can it keep the promise to all 270 million beneficiaries both eligible today and out into the future? 
   Question No. 6: Does it create new, undisclosed contingent liabilities? 
   Question No. 7: Does it increase payroll taxes or place an obligation on general revenues? 
   And question No. 8: Are there safety valves to accommodate future growth in the program? 
   These are the key financial questions. The GAO has laid out an evaluation of the five dominant plans that have been offered by Members of Congress to the public. 
   In addition, GAO attempts to do an analysis of the administration and implementation issues in each plan. 
   Finally, GAO attempts to evaluate whether or not equity--generational equity--and progressivity have been taken into account in each plan. Equity and progressivity are always important. Social Security is a very progressive program to beneficiaries. 
   I hope that this GAO report gets a little bit of air time and a little bit of consideration by Members. I hope that particular attention will be paid to the do-nothing, status quo plan. 
   There are consequences to the do-nothing plan. The current status quo plan dramatically increases debt and interest costs in the future. This large debt will have a major impact on the tax burdens and interest rates of future workers. GAO comments very unfavorably when it measures the status quo approach against its eight financial criteria. There are very negative consequences for both current beneficiaries and future beneficiaries and the American taxpayers for doing nothing. 
   I urge my colleagues to take a closer look at this GAO report--and to really understand the cost tradeoffs between different approaches to Social Security reform. The battle cry all year long has been to save Social Security first. We created an elaborate lockbox mechanism so we could do it. My hope is that next year, 
   with the assistance of GAO and this report, we will see an increasing number of Members who are enthusiastic about putting their names on specific legislation to reform Social Security. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I will be done by 3:30. 
   I intend to vote for this legislation. I congratulate the parents of the bill: Senator GRAMM, Senator SARBANES, and others, who worked very hard. This was not easy to do. 
   I agree, it is Government at its best. I believe this is very much proconsumer. There is nothing more frustrating than trying to do a financial transaction and being told: I would like to be able to do it, but I can't. We have been limiting our individual capacity to develop our economy, to pursue the American dream, and do all other sorts of things that make America such a great country. 
   I appreciate very much the effort made to make certain there is still good regulatory oversight. I have no doubt that safety and soundness considerations will be taken into account. I think the concerns that we are going to have a meltdown such as we had in 1929 are concerns that are dramatically overblown, given the strength both of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve in this legislation. 
   So I appreciate very much the hard work and diligence of the chairman and the ranking member because I believe our economy and our people will benefit from it. 
   I am grateful as well--I do not know if the Senator from Texas is--that the unitary thrift provision is limited in this legislation. The Johnson-Kerrey amendment that passed on the floor might have been a bit difficult, but I think it is an important provision. I like the provisions for community reinvestment. I think it is a terrific compromise. My small banks have been asking for regulatory relief that provides it. I think the sunshine provisions are quite exciting. I look forward to seeing where this money and how this money is being spent. 
   On the issue of privacy, you have improved current privacy protections, better than what we have under existing law. I must say, I had my own interest in privacy, and my concern about privacy increased as a consequence of examining this bill. I hope to participate in a bipartisan effort to give the American people the kind of privacy protections that American citizens both expect and deserve. 
   Again, I congratulate and thank very much the chairman and ranking member. It is a very important piece of legislation. People were predicting you were not going to be able to get the job done. I hope you enjoyed the pizza that night when you stayed up very late to finish your work. I am grateful you went the extra mile. There is no doubt in my mind there is going to be a positive cause and effect between this bill being law and the health of the U.S. economy.

    Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, today I would like to express my support for ``The Open and Accountable Campaign Financing Act of 1999,'' which would provide this country with much needed campaign finance reform. Our Constitution lays out the requirements for someone running for office. In order to run for the Senate, the Constitution tells us that there are three requirements: you must be at least 30 years old; you must have been a U.S. citizen for nine years; and you must be a resident of the state you wish to represent. 
   What the Constitution doesn't tell you about is a fourth requirement: you must have an awful lot of money, or at least know how to raise it. The Constitution doesn't tell you this because when the framers drafted the Constitution, they could not have imagined the ridiculously large amounts of time and money one must spend today if he or she wants to be elected to office. 
   We need to change the law to give power back to working families, restore their faith in the process, and make democracy work. That's why I have been an avid supporter of the McCain-Feingold bill and the Shays-Meehan bill that recently passed the House, and that's why I am now a cosponsor of Senator HAGEL's bill. 
   Earlier this month, the Senate debated the McCain-Feingold bill. This year's version was a stripped down version of the McCain-Feingold bills we've debated, and I have supported, in years past. Although I prefer the more comprehensive House passed Shays-Meehan bill, I understood Senators MCCAIN and FEINGOLD'S decision to purposefully strip down their bill. They knew the realities of the vote count in the Senate. We didn't have the votes to pass anything more comprehensive, so they introduced a ``barebones'' bill which essentially did one simple thing: ban soft money. 
   Unfortunately, the bill was pulled from the floor after a vote showing McCain-Feingold still didn't have the votes to pass. The good news is we picked up one vote; the bad news is we still haven't passed a campaign finance reform bill. We made progress. That is why it is important to not let this issue die on the back burner. That is why I am joining in Senator HAGEL's effort to keep this issue alive. 
   Currently, soft money is uncapped and unregulated--corporations, unions and wealthy individuals can contribute unlimited amounts of soft money. Senator HAGEL's bill would cap soft money at $60,000. Although I prefer a complete ban, it is clear the Senate is a few votes short of passing this ban. Senator HAGEL's new approach just might be the compromise that can muster enough votes to pass the Senate. Let me be clear--while I prefer much more comprehensive reform of our campaign financing system--I do believe Senator HAGEL's proposal is a step in the right direction. This bill, with its cap on soft money and tightening of disclosure requirements, would be a good beginning. 
   The American people are frustrated with the millions of dollars they see poured into campaigns. They are frustrated with out tendency to talk instead of act. I am hopeful this bill can help make that happen. In fact I want to applaud my friend, Senator HAGEL for his efforts, and urge our colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, let me thank President Clinton for provoking debate about Social Security and what we ought to be doing to extend the solvency of the program. I don't support the proposal he has made, but I suspect there are many people in this body who don't support the proposal that I have made either. At least the President has put on the table an idea, and it is an idea that enables us, if we take a bit of time, to see what is wrong with the funding of this program and why there is an urgent need to fix it. 
   First, what the President does is exactly what I just heard the Senator from Tennessee say; what the President would do through his proposal is give beneficiaries who are alive between 2035 and 2050--beneficiaries who are, today, between the ages of 30 and 45--an additional $20 trillion claim on the income taxes of future working Americans. That is how the President's proposal would be funded. 
   Under current law, we will need $6 trillion worth of income taxes to pay beneficiaries between 2014 and 2034--this is above and beyond the revenue beneficiaries can claim from the 12.4% payroll tax on all working Americans. Today, there are 44 million beneficiaries: 39 million are old-age beneficiaries, 6.5 million are disabled, and 7 million are survivors. These beneficiaries receive the proceeds of a 12.4-percent payroll tax on the wages of most working Americans. 
   I suspect most Members of Congress didn't realize that back in 1983 we made a change in the law to assess a payroll tax that was larger than needed to pay the bills. Since then, those extra payroll tax dollars have been spent on other things. Between 2014 and 2034, we will have to pay back those borrowed Social Security payroll tax dollars with interest--and we will do so by either increasing income taxes, cutting other spending, or increasing our national debt. This year, for example, we will take in about $513 billion in revenue into the program--but we only need about $387 billion to cover expenditures. My guess is most Members of Congress didn't realize that the Treasury can only use these excess payroll tax dollars to buy special-issue Treasury bonds. Eventually, the Treasury has to reconvert those bond assets to cash--and it does so by using income tax dollars. 
   Starting in 2014, Treasury will have to use income taxes and corporate income taxes to convert each and every single one of those bonds into cash that they will then use to pay beneficiaries--about $6 trillion worth. 
   If that does not bother you that we have to use an additional $6 trillion to pay benefits between 2014 and 2034--money that could have been spent on important discretionary spending programs, then you probably like the President's proposal. If you want the Social Security program to become more and more a program that uses both payroll taxes in addition to individual and corporate income taxes, you probably like the President's proposal. The President's proposal allows you to avoid making the difficult choices necessary in reforming Social Security, such as either explicitly raising the payroll tax--and I haven't heard anybody actually support that, although some have supported increasing the wage base--or making benefit adjustments out in the future; or a third way, which the Senator from Tennessee and I and half a dozen others in this body have chosen to do, is to use a combination of benefit adjustments out in the future, holding harmless everybody currently over the age of 62, and establishing retirement savings accounts--designed in a progressive way. Our plan ensures that women and low income individuals will receive significantly larger benefits. That is the purpose of these savings accounts--to help all working Americans build wealth for themselves. Privatization is just an attempt to give, especially that lower-wage individual, more than just the promise of a transfer payment coming from Social Security taxes. Our goal is to make individuals less dependent on the government for their financial security at retirement.  
   One of the most difficult and important things to understand in the Social Security debate is this idea of solvency. Solvency is an accountant's term. There are 270 million Americans today--nearly all of whom will be beneficiaries of the Social Security program at some point during their lifetimes. More than 44 million are eligible today. That means there are 230 million beneficiaries who will be eligible at some point in the future. That is the way to think about solvency--we have to make the program solvent for all retirees current and future. The idea is to keep the promise for every eventual beneficiary, whether you are 20 years old or 70 years old. Right now we cannot keep the promise to all 270 million Americans. There are approximately 145 million working Americans under the age of 45 to whom we cannot keep the promise of paying benefits. According to the Social Security Administration, these 145 million Americans will experience somewhere between a 25- and a 33-percent cut in benefits at some point during their retirement. 
   So when we talk about solvency, it is a real human issue. There are 145 million Americans today to whom we are not going to be able to keep the promise we made back in the 1930s. That is why a large percentage of young people say they don't believe Social Security will be there. They are partly right--Social Security will be there, but in a much smaller form as a consequence of Congress simply not having enough revenue in the system to be able to cover the bills. 
   What the President says is that he doesn't want to propose a payroll tax increase, or benefit reductions. He doesn't want to support the idea of individual wealth accounts. What he wants to do is give the Social Security beneficiaries out in the future a larger claim than they would have under current law on income taxes--on the wages of future working Americans. 
   I believe we made a mistake in 1983; that diverting $6 trillion of individual and corporate income taxes into the Social Security program makes our tight discretionary budget problem even worse. The President's plan exacerbates this problem by saying what we should give an additional $20 trillion in income tax dollars to extend the solvency of the trust for another 20 years. 
   I will reiterate what I said at the beginning. I still appreciate the President's contribution to the debate. He has provoked, for a short period of time at least, a real debate about what we are going to do to solve the problem of Social Security insolvency. I disagree with one element of his proposal because I think it takes a necessity and converts it into a virtue. I do hope, at least for a short period of time, we will discuss and debate Social Security reform. I hope we can discuss in a constructive fashion, what we are going to do to reform the program--rather than just talk about needing to fix Social Security. We need to discuss what we are going to do to finally change the law to keep the promise to all 270 million American beneficiaries.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I offer my condolences to Ginny and the entire Chafee family for the loss of her husband, their father, and our friend, John Chafee. 
   When a great person leaves us, we know we can't replace him and we know have suffered the loss in a very personal way. All of us feel that loss with John Chafee. It is not just the loss of a Senator, it is someone now who is missing in our lives, and we have to deal with that in the way human beings have to deal with losses of this kind. Also, when a great man leaves us, when great people leave us, oftentimes they will put on the television screen the date of birth and the date of passing, and they did that in this case with John Chafee: 1922-1999. He was 77 remarkable years, Mr. President. 
   I had a conference in Omaha with young people recently on the question of how to save money. They were juniors and seniors. I have done this for 2 or 3 years in a row. Warren Buffett, a rather wealthy man, was our keynote speaker. He talked for a couple of minutes, and then he took questions. Two years ago, a young person said to him, ``Mr. Buffett, I mean no disrespect, but aren't most wealthy people jerks?'' Warren answered, ``No, that is not my experience. Wealth just allows you to be a little more of what you already were. If you start off a jerk and become wealthy, you can be a real big jerk and hire lawyers for $1,000 an hour and sue all your friends. On the contrary, if you start off a good person and you acquire wealth, you can be a really good person.'' 
   That was John Chafee. John was born into wealth and privilege. At the age of 19, after the United States was drawn into World War II after being attacked by Japan, he volunteered, but not for any special duty; he was an enlisted man in the U.S. Marine Corps. Among other places, he had to fight in one of the bloodiest battles in Guadalcanal. Then he went back to college, and the Korean conflict broke out, and there was no question that had he chosen to, he could have figured out a way not to go. But he went in this time as an officer commanding a rifle company. 
   I have had many occasions where I would say, ``I was so impressed, John, by what you did''; and, of course, all of us who knew him would know he would blush and change the subject. He did not want praise. He didn't want people to think he was anything special. He did this all as a consequence of the way he was. He didn't think he deserved any special attention at all. 
   Again, taking my Warren Buffett experience, in talking to the young people, he didn't talk about wealth. He said: You are born with three things--intelligence, endurance, and the opportunity to build integrity. You have to decide how much intelligence and endurance you are going to use. You build integrity every single day with the choices you make. Sometimes you make good choices, and sometimes they are bad. 
   I would scratch my head if somebody asked me to give them a choice John Chafee made that was bad, which produced inferior integrity. And I don't just mean the issues. I am impressed by what he did on the environment. He believed we needed to leave the world better than we found it. He knew we had to think beyond our lifetimes in order to do that. I was impressed by his courage on public safety. I never have and never would go as far as he did on gun control, but it took guts to do that. All of us who watched him do that had to admire that. 
   On health, there were always other people--the disabled and people who were born with less than he was born with. He didn't just fight with them, and he knew it wasn't for political reasons. He cared about the lives of other people. So I was impressed with what he did on all the issues. 
   But the thing  that moved me the most and causes me to say that I will miss this man and I will note his absence is that I consider what the world is like without him, and I think it is less without him. So it was considerably more as a consequence of the choice he made to be kind, the choice he made to be considerate, the choice he made to respect other people. That is a choice we all have to make. Are you going to be kind? You are not born with an attitude of kindness. You have to choose it. You have to choose to be considerate and respectful. 
   Again, I have been here for 10 years. I can't think of a single moment even when he was provoked that John Chafee ever said an unkind word about anybody. He would disagree. He would argue. I never heard him say an unkind word. That was a choice he made. It didn't come as a result of him being a man or a human being. It was a choice and a decision that he made. It was old school values, in my opinion. 
   As a consequence of that, I find myself wondering what life is going to be like without John Chafee. 
   I hope his wife and family understand what a big impact he made. John caused not just improvement in our laws, improvement of our country, and improvement of our world but improvement of our values. 
   For those of us who fall short of the mark that John Chafee laid down with his behavior, there is an ideal of a goal that he set for ourselves. 
   I hope as we debate and make decisions about how we are going to treat one another that we remember the way John Chafee treated us. I think if we remember that, it is likely that we will treat not just one another better but as a consequence of that treatment this will be a better place, and the country will be a better place, and the world will be a better place as well. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KERREY. I have to leave as well. I have come a couple times trying to engage in a colloquy on this piece of legislation. I thought now would be the time to take a few minutes to do so. 
   I support a woman's right to choose. I voted yes on Medicaid funding. I think it is critical for me to support a woman's right to choose for those people who cannot afford it. I supported Federal employees' rights to use health insurance, and I supported rights of people in the armed services to reproductive services. I think I voted five times against your legislation or something to that extent, and a couple times to sustain the President's veto. 
   I want people on both sides of the aisle to understand this procedure deeply troubles me. I am not certain how I am going to vote this time around. I indicated to people in Nebraska that I am listening to their concerns about this procedure. 
   I state at the beginning this is a very difficult issue because very often we do not have a chance to debate and talk about it in a personal way, as in the way the Senator from Pennsylvania did last evening. I caught about the last 30 minutes of the presentation. It is a very moving and personal presentation the Senator makes, and oftentimes we just do not get that. We lock in our positions early on in our political careers and are told by our political consultants: You cannot change your position or modify your position in any way--especially in my case; I am coming up on an election--you are doing it for political reasons, so forth, your supporters get bitterly disappointed, on and on and all that political advice. 
   I have, in my case, to ignore that. I find this to be very much about what kind of a country we want to be, and it is a very serious debate. I do not know  that we have time, I say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, today or right now to do it, but at some point, even when the Senator from California is down 
   here, I want to talk about this question of medical necessity because for me it turns on that. If this procedure is not medically necessary, then your legislation is not an undue burden upon anyone who chooses to undergo an abortion. It is not an undue burden. If it is medically necessary, then it can be an undue burden. That is where it gets in a hurry for me as I consider this. 
   I have talked to people in Nebraska about this, both for and against. It is very difficult for anybody, once they consider what this procedure is, to say: Gosh, that's good; it doesn't bother me; I am not concerned about it. Almost unanimously people say there is something about this that just does not seem right. 
   I wonder if the Senator can talk for a bit--I do not want to drag him too long into this discussion--about this issue of medical necessity. I will announce ahead of time for the staff, for the Senator from California, I will give her an opportunity, as well, to describe why she believes this is medically necessary. I have heard the Senator from Pennsylvania say it is not. I appreciate very much an opportunity to hear directly from him.

   Mr. KERREY. I appreciate that very much. 
   Mr. President, I expect, after lunch, to come back. I hope there is an opportunity to engage in this kind of colloquy. 
   I will give you an example. There was a woman who approached me and said: Senator, there are times when a woman gets an abortion where she would prefer not to. She has gone in for delivery--that is the situation this woman described to me. She went in to deliver a baby. She went in and delivered prematurely, and the doctor had to make a decision and chose, she thought, this procedure--I don't know precisely; I don't have the documentation on this--but thought the doctor chose this procedure and was worried that if this procedure was not available, the doctor might not have been able to save her life. 
   I presume the Senator has a response to that. This is not a unique situation. In other words, this is not a woman who has chosen to have an abortion. She wanted to have the baby. She wanted to deliver the baby.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I accomplished at least the objective of letting people know that: Please, don't put me in the ``no column'' on this immediately. I indicated the last time this thing was around that I have significant reservations about it. I have listened to people and talked to people, especially at home, and under no circumstances do I--I was Governor for 4 years and have been a Senator for 10 years. The worst thing is to be locked into a position from which people say you can't change, even if you acquire evidence that your previous position is wrong. 
   So I want both the Senator from Pennsylvania and especially the people  in Nebraska to understand that I am looking at it. If I conclude I was wrong the other time, I will vote differently this time.

   Mr. KERREY. I ask the Senator to respond to me. We had a colloquy earlier. I have the Eighth Circuit decision. Earlier all I had was opinions on the Eighth Circuit decision from both opponents and supporters of the Senator's legislation. The Eighth Circuit says, referencing the Nebraska statute, which is the concern I have, that it did create an undue burden because, in many instances, it would ban the most common procedure of second-trimester abortions, and that is the D&E. You are saying you are drawing it more narrowly so it does not.

   ..... deliberately and intentionally delivering into the vagina a living unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof, for the purpose of performing a procedure that the person performing such procedure knows will kill the unborn child and does kill the unborn child.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KERREY. I will get you the comparative language. Again, I will not give the precise Eighth Circuit compared to yours. You have been on this a lot longer than I have, and I know the Senator from California has as well. Perhaps between the two of you, you can clarify if this change meets the Eighth Circuit's test. 
   I understand that this is one circuit, and you may get--I have voted against other circuits before when they have had decisions, so there is certainly precedent for me ignoring what a court says. 
   But in the earlier discussion we had, I expressed one of the concerns I have. And since we talked earlier, I have talked to an OB/GYN from Omaha who does not, in a normal practice, conduct abortions. What she does is work with women who are pregnant and helps them through their delivery. She is expressing a concern that if she is working with a woman who is having some difficulty, because of the penalties that are in here, she finds herself saying: Am I going to be able to do something that I ordinarily might have done?  
   In other words, you said to me earlier, when I talked about this, that this is for people who intentionally make a decision to go in and get an abortion as opposed to somebody, as this doctor described to me, who is not going in for an abortion. I think it is a very important point because the universe consists of people who get abortions but do not want one; they were intending to deliver, and the doctor, for medical reasons, makes this decision, but the woman may prefer that that not have happened. The doctor is making the decision based upon life and health considerations. And you said to me it has to be the intent. Where in the bill does it say that?

   Mr. KERREY. I just faxed the language to her, both the amended version and the original version. 
   Again, one of the problems that all of us have--I have two problems: One, as a man, I have difficulty trying to figure all this out; but secondly, as a nonphysician, I have a difficult time figuring it out. She starts talking to me and says: Understand, the cervical arteries are at 3 and 9 o'clock. 
   What you are dealing with here is a situation where you can produce damage. You have to be careful not to. In other words, she is saying to me: Understand that delivery itself is a life-threatening process--as the Senator from Pennsylvania knows all too well. Delivery itself is a life-threatening process to the mother, and decisions are being made by the physician as to what to do and what not to do. And she is very concerned that this will make it difficult for her to continue her practice. 
   As I said, I faxed it to her. And I look forward to further colloquies with the Senator.

   Mr. KERREY. I appreciate that. I said earlier, when we had our colloquy, that I am comfortable in my position in saying I believe a woman or doctor, physician, should--and her spiritual counselor--be making this decision. I consider myself to be a pro-choice individual as a consequence of that. 
   I supported Medicaid funding because I think it is hypocritical of me not to if I am going to let people who have the means get a legal procedure. But this procedure troubles me. I have voted against you on a number of occasions. And I have promised people in Nebraska I would keep an open mind. I listened, especially last evening, to your arguments. And I am willing to keep an open mind on this.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to describe why I think it is very important to hang on to the bill the Senator from Wisconsin and the Senator from Arizona have put before us on campaign finance reform. 
   There will be all kinds of amendments offered to change the bill, some of which I support strongly. It seems to me our only chance of getting this legislation passed is to stick as closely as possible to the bill we currently have in front of us. 
   I have had a fair amount of experience in soliciting soft money contributions from donors. I can say that both the contributors and myself, and anybody else who solicits, would have a difficult time denying they are extremely uncomfortable with the dollar  amounts that are coming into political parties, or for that matter--I have never done it--for individual organizations that are spending money in a so-called generic fashion as well. 
   One of the reasons, I say to the Senator from Wisconsin, I feel strongly that change is needed is because we have added a fourth requirement to the Constitution for service in the Senate. The Constitution lays out three requirements for someone who wants to run for office--you have to be a U.S. citizen for 9 years; you have to be 30 years of age; and you have to live in the State for whose office you are running. But there has been a fourth requirement added, and that is you have to be able to raise enough money or you will not be a credible candidate. 
   Those who have been challenged before, those who have run for office will tell you, if you do not have enough money to advertise on television--I know the Senator from Wisconsin ran on an anti-incumbent strategy, but it is very difficult for most citizens. In Nebraska, there are only a handful of people who are eligible given that fourth requirement. 
   I wonder if the Senator from Wisconsin will tell me if what I am saying is true. I like Shays-Meehan. I like the bill. The junior Senator from Nebraska, Mr. HAGEL, has an amendment I like as well. The trouble is, when these amendments are adopted, if these amendments are adopted, it reduces the chances of our defeating a declared filibuster. It makes it much more likely we will fail to break a filibuster and, as a consequence of that failure, fail to enact legislation, and as a consequence of that, we will never go to conference and never change the law. 
   I wonder if he can comment on that a bit because there are a lot of us who will be facing amendments coming up on this bill. The comment we will have is: Gee, I like that amendment; why not vote for it? There may be a good answer why not to vote for it. It may be the amendment will make it difficult for us to succeed in changing the law and reducing, in my mind--I understand and appreciate the problem of apparent corruption. I would like to get that out of the system. The big thing I see in the system right now is we have a very high barrier to public service, and it is much harder, as a consequence, to persuade men and women that they ought to take one of us on and try to come and serve their State and Nation.

   Mr. KERREY. The Senator is very kind to say I have always been a supporter. Actually I have not always been a supporter. When I came to the Senate in 1989, this was not a very important issue. Indeed, at one point, I joined the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. MCCONNELL, to defeat campaign finance reform. 
   Then I had the experience of going inside the beast in 1996, 1997, and 1998 when I was Chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee--I do not want to raise a sore subject for the Senator from Maine. It changed my attitude in two big ways: One, the apparent corruption that exists. People believe there is corruption. If they believe it, it happens. We all understand that. If the perception is it is A, it is A even though we know it may not be, and the people believe the system is corrupt. 
   Equally important to me, I discovered in 1996, 1997, and 1998 that there are men and women who would love to serve. They say: I can't be competitive; I can't possibly raise the money necessary to go on television; oh, and by the way, my reputation could get damaged as a consequence of what could be said on television against me. 
   I am persuaded this law needs to be changed for the good of the Republic, for the good of democracy. I hope Members, such as myself, who are enthusiastic about changing that law will take the advice of the Senator from Wisconsin and the Senator from Arizona to heart because we may have to vote against things we prefer in order to make certain we get something that not only we want but the Nation desperately needs.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, in the waning days of his administration, President Eisenhower proposed a test ban treaty to end all nuclear tests in the atmosphere, in the oceans, and under the ground. Nearly four decades later, the Senate stands on the verge of a vote on ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I will vote in favor of ratification. I regret the move to postpone a vote because I am of the firm conviction this treaty will help end the proliferation of nuclear weapons and increase the safety of the American people. 
   President Eisenhower proposed the test ban having recognized the increasing danger posed by nuclear weapons. At that time, the threat was very real. The American people had a vivid understanding of the devastating consequences of nuclear weapons. 
   Those of us in our fifties remember the threat and the fear that we had as children--the duck and cover drills, the constant reminders of the devastation that a single nuclear weapon could produce to our cities and to our communities. In many ways, the problem we have today comes from our success because the fear we once had has been displaced by a false sense of complacency, a sense of security that, in my view, is not justified, given the facts. 
   I would like to illustrate this danger by a realistic scenario, in my view, with a single Russian nuclear weapon. It is possible for a small band of discontented or terroristic members of either the Russian society or some other nation to raid a silo of Russian missiles in the Russian wilderness. Soldiers who are poorly trained, sparsely equipped, and irate at not having been paid in a year are easily overtaken or are willing to cooperate. 
   Let's pick one city to illustrate the damage. I, again, call to my colleagues' attention that this kind of game playing, this kind of example was quite common as recently as 10 years ago. But today, when you ask what kind of damage could occur as a result of a single nuclear blast, you are apt to have people scratching their heads, wondering what could happen. So let me take Chicago as an example. 
   First of all, unlike many of the other threats in the world, if a rocket left Russia, it would arrive in Chicago within an hour, probably taking a trajectory over the top of the world across the Arctic pole. It would detonate in Chicago within an hour, and on a bad day it would hit a target within a few hundred yards off Lake Michigan. 
   We spent a great deal of time assessing the danger of the 
   nation of China. Their missiles are not connected to their warheads. Their warheads are disconnected; they are not together. It would take them several days and they are not targeted with the accuracy and would not arrive with the same swiftness as an unauthorized or accidental launch coming from Russia. 
   The first effect of the blast would be the nuclear flash. The air would be heated to 10 million degrees Celsius. The blast would move out at a few hundred kilometers a second and its heat would be sufficient to set fire to anything combustible at a distance of 14 kilometers. People within 80 kilometers would be blinded. The blast effect would follow. It would travel out from ground zero. Within 3 kilometers, those who had not already been killed would die from this percussive force. 
   The details of this kind of a blast needs to be understood by the American people as this debate goes forward, because the good news of the end of the cold war has been replaced with the bad news that we are increasingly at risk of individuals or nonnation state people who choose to do damage to the United States of America and do not care if they die in the execution of their mission. They are willing to attack the United States of America and they are willing to take American lives without regard to the fact that they may die in the execution of their mission. 
   A single Russian nuclear weapon launched accidentally, or a single nuclear weapon assembled by some rogue nation and delivered by whatever the means to the United States of America, would do more damage than any other threat we currently have on the horizon. A single Russian submarine that was taken over by a similar sort of dissident faction could launch 64 one-hundred-kiloton weapons at the United States. I do not come here to alarm anybody about this. I come simply to remind people that nuclear weapons are still the only threat that could kill every single American. It would not take thousands to bring the United States of America to its knees. It would not take the kind of total attack we once feared from the Soviet Union to bring America from being the most powerful economic and military force on the Earth to being somewhat short of No. 1, not only putting us at increasing risk but putting the rest of the world at risk as well. 
   CTBT is by no means the only thing we must do in order to reduce the risk of proliferation. I would like to go through a few ideas prior to talking about both our capacity to verify and the confidence I have that we can maintain our stockpile without the need to test. 
   First, we have to maintain our intelligence capabilities: our ability to collect intelligence, to process, to disseminate, to deliver that intelligence to warfighters is far and away the best in the world. Talk to our allies in Kosovo, in Bosnia, in Desert Storm; talk to any of those whose lives were at risk and were allied with the United States of America in a military effort and they will tell you our intelligence collection and dissemination capability gave us the capacity to do the impossible. 
   Our intelligence agencies, from time to time, make very highly publicized mistakes. Unfortunately, the publicity given to those mistakes gives some a lack of confidence in our capability of doing our mission. That lack of confidence is misplaced. We are an open society. As a consequence, we tend--correctly so--to examine the things we do when we make 
   mistakes. Unfortunately, at times it produces a situation where we are afraid of doing things because we are worried we are going to make a highly publicized mistake and therefore that mistake is going to ruin our career or make it difficult for us to advance. As a consequence, we sometimes are a little too cautious. 
   Americans should not suffer the illusion we currently have the intelligence capacity to know everything that is going on in the world; we simply do not. Indeed, we should not. We are not, as well, allocating enough resources, in my view, to make certain policymakers of the future are informed so conflicts that might occur can be avoided and so nuclear threats can be confronted before they emerge to be challenges. 
   The second tool that must be maintained to confront the emerging nuclear threat is not only a strong military but an intent to use that military to meet any individual or nation state that threatens the United States of America. Our military is the envy of the world. While we must avoid the temptation of using our military forces in situations not vital to U.S. interests, we must also continue to maintain the will to use military force in instances in which our national security is at risk. 
   The third tool is national missile defense. I support the creation of a limited national missile defense designed  to protect the United States of America from rogue state ballistic missile launches and accidental launches. While the success of the recent test of a prototype missile defense system demonstrates that limited national missile defense is possible, we must also realize it is not a panacea for the dangers we will confront. 
   The fourth tool in our effort to secure the post-cold-war peace is further reductions in the American and Russian nuclear arsenals. I have argued on the Senate floor previously the President should immediately take bold action to restart the arms control process. If we do not drastically reduce U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals, the danger of their accidental use or proliferation will increase exponentially. I recognize that deep reductions--while decreasing the chance of unauthorized or accidental launch--could actually increase the danger of material proliferation. Therefore, any such parallel reductions in our nuclear forces must include arrangements and a U.S. commitment to provide funding to secure and manage the resultant nuclear material. This is the fifth tool. We are fortunate we will not begin from scratch on this problem. We can build on one of the greatest acts of the post-cold-war statesmanship, the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. 
   The final piece of the nuclear safety puzzle is the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I support the CTBT because I believe it will enhance U.S. national security, reduce nuclear dangers, and keep the American people safe. Let me explain how. 
   First, a fully implemented CTBT will all but halt the ability of threshold states from establishing an effective and reliable strategic nuclear force. The inability of nations such as Iran and North Korea to conduct nuclear tests will make it much less likely for them to become nuclear powers. Along the same line, the inability of existing nuclear states to conduct further nuclear tests will impede, if not stop, their efforts to make technological advances in yields and miniaturization, advances already achieved by the United States. 
   Bluntly speaking, we have the most effective and deadly nuclear force in the world. Therefore, to maintain our existing nuclear edge, it is in our interest to ratify the CTBT and to halt the nuclear development advancement of other nations. 
   In addition, we all have experienced coming to this Chamber to vote on a sanction imposed upon an individual nation as a consequence of us judging correctly that that nation poses a threat and, in many cases, a potential nuclear threat to the United States of America. 
   We struggle with that vote because we know a unilateral sanction by the United States of America will oftentimes be used by our allies as a means for them to capture the market share of some product we were selling to that nation. With this treaty, it is far more likely the Security Council will support multilateral sanctions that will enable us to get the desired effect without us having to suffer adverse consequences as a consequence of unilateral sanctions. 
   In the post-cold-war era, nuclear weapons have become the Rolex wristwatch of international security, a costly purchase whose real purpose is not the service it provides but the prestige it confers. Ratification and implementation of the CTBT is in our national security interest precisely because it will help slow the expansion of the nuclear club and make it more difficult for nations to acquire these deadly weapons. 
   Opponents of the CTBT focus their criticisms on two main points: verifiability of the treaty and the safety of our nuclear stockpile. Let me address each of these issues separately. 
   First, we can effectively monitor and verify CTBT. I purposely say ``effectively monitor and verify'' because absolute verification is neither attainable nor a necessary standard. But it is the standard that some have attempted to establish as a benchmark for ratification. No treaty is absolutely verifiable. 
   My support for this treaty comes from my firm conviction that by using existing assets, the United States can effectively monitor and verify this treaty. I base my convictions on the testimony of Gen. John Gordon, Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, and on the briefings on this topic received by the Intelligence Committee over the years and, most important, the performance of those men and women who work in a variety of agencies whose task it is to collect, to process, to evaluate, to analyze, and to disseminate intelligence to national customers, as well as war fighters who are defending the people of the United States of America. 
   The United States has the capability to detect any test that can threaten our nuclear deterrence. The type of test that could be conducted without our knowledge could only be marginally useful and would not cause a shift in the existing strategic nuclear balance. In addition, the United States has the capability to detect the level of testing that would be required for another country to develop and to weaponize an advanced thermonuclear warhead. 
   Our intelligence community is the best in the world. This gives us an enormous lead over every other signatory. Public disclosures of intelligence community problems may have shaken confidence in our intelligence capabilities, but let me assure my colleagues that their confidence should not be shaken. U.S. intelligence has the ability to know what is occurring around the world regarding the development of nuclear weapons. It is 
   our intelligence community that largely gives Secretary Cohen and General Shelton their confidence to say the treaty should be ratified because it is in our national interest to do so. 
   I will briefly describe how we will know what is happening when someone tries to cheat. I will use all caution to make certain I give away nothing that will provide our enemies with indications of what our sources or our methods are, but I urge colleagues who doubt this to get full briefings on what our collection capability is and what we are able to do to determine whether or not somebody is in violation of this treaty. 
   I will briefly describe, as I said, and because the existence of this highly secretive organization, the National Reconnaissance Office, has finally been declassified--we are able now to admit that from space, the United States can see you and can gather signals intelligence. I urge colleagues to get a full briefing on what the NRO can do in a classified fashion. I believe my colleagues fully understand the significance of what I just said. 
   Every part of the globe is accessible from space. There you will find satellite reconnaissance either watching or collecting electrical signals from those who would do damage to the United States of America. That is a tremendous capability that no one else can equal. This global accessibility from space is just one feature of a very complicated and complex system of collecting and analyzing information. 
   The National Security Agency is a second feature. They exploit foreign communications. That is the official unclassified description of its mission: NSA exploits foreign communications. Recently, Hollywood has enjoyed making a couple of movies showing how NSA is a threat to our Nation. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is a Hollywood make-believe story that is completely inaccurate and false. NSA is not a threat to us. If you are an unfriendly foreign government wanting to cheat on CTBT, NSA is certainly a threat to you. 
   To quote from their official unclassified agency description: ``They are on the cutting edge of information technology.'' They know what is going on in the explosion of information technology. 
   There is a third area beyond NSA, and that is called MASINT. It is a pretty strange term for most people. It means measurement and signatures intelligence, the recognition that in addition to being seen and being heard, objects, especially electronic objects, have other signatures. Like your personal signature--if we collect enough information about someone's signature, it is not like anything else, it is unique, and we know exactly what it is, and we are collecting MASINT. 
   The Central Intelligence Agency gives us a fourth important feature. The CIA employs a network of agents around the world who constantly provide what is called HUMINT, human intelligence. HUMINT is a term of art  which simply recognizes people tend to talk, and when they do talk, we try to have an agent listening. If an agent hears something, it is fed into a fifth and important feature of the agency, and that is the CIA Directorate of Intelligence. 
   The men and women of the CIA DI sift through enormous amounts of data every day and separate fact from fiction, truth from lies. Through their analysis of all intelligence sources, they provide policymakers with crisp statements of what our potential adversaries are doing and not doing. If information is out there to get, we will get it. If it is important, we will analyze it and understand it. Once we understand it, 
   policymakers will make sound decisions if someone decides to cheat on the CTBT. 
   I am trying to paint a picture of just how sophisticated our intelligence community is. It is a community that on occasion has been fooled, but it has not been fooled often, and it has rarely been fooled for very long. We have a world-class intelligence capability. We can count on the intelligence community to monitor the CTBT and effectively verify it. 
   A second argument that has been used against the treaty by some is based upon the suspension of nuclear testing required by the CTBT and the argument that this will jeopardize the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile. I have an extremely high level of confidence in the nuclear stockpile even without continued testing. 
   The science-based Stockpile Stewardship Program, on which the United States is spending $4.5 billion a year, is maintaining our technological edge without the need for further testing for the foreseeable future. This program is based on the most advanced science in the world. It is based on over 50 years of nuclear experience. It is based on the results of over 1,000 American nuclear tests. It is a program that relies on the ability and ingenuity of U.S. scientists to maintain our nuclear edge. But it is also a program that recognizes the need to build in adequate safeguards to ensure safety and reliability. 
   The Stockpile Stewardship Program requires a rigorous annual review of the entire nuclear stockpile. As a part of this regime, both the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy must certify to the President on an annual basis the stockpile is safe and is reliable. Should either Secretary be unable to offer this certification, the President, in consultation with Congress, is prepared to exercise the right of the United States to withdraw from the treaty and to resume testing. 
   The United States has not conducted a nuclear test for over 7 years, but the American people should understand our nuclear stockpile is safe. Both the safeguards and the science exists to continue to assure its safety well into the future. And since we have made the decision we do not need to test, it only makes sense that we use the CTBT to end testing throughout the world. 
   Reflecting on his time in office, and his failure to achieve the goal of a nuclear test ban, President Eisenhower stated: ``Disarmament . . . is a continuous imperative. . . . Because this need is so sharp and apparent, I confess I lay down my official responsibilities in this field with a definite sense of disappointment.'' 
   The Senate now has the opportunity to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. We should ratify this treaty because, just as when it was first proposed nearly 4 decades ago, it is a positive step toward reducing nuclear dangers and improving the safety of the American people. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. Madam President, I rise in support of the conference report, though I have many of the same reservations I heard the Senator from Pennsylvania express. I was not present to hear the comments of the Senator from Mississippi, but I suspect he has reservations about the conference report, as well. 
   As was pointed out, the conference was adjourned as a result of the decision by the House not to come back. Many matters that were not in this conference report such as sanctions, probably would have been in the report. My guess is we are moving toward some kind of resolution of that particular issue that did not make it into the conference report. 
   We did not get additional money in the legislation for Farm Service Agency employees. I think we will need that. I don't think it is fair to ask the Farm Service Agency to find the money from other programs, that basically the farmers will have to pay to deliver this program themselves. 
   There was an effort to get--and I think we have succeeded--bipartisan support to provide some resources for a very heavily attacked sector of our agricultural economy, the hog industry, where there are not only low prices but also significant structural changes going on. We had an innovative proposal for cooperatives that enabled Members to come up with a win-win solution without having to put a bunch of money in the program and enabled Congress to use some ideas that this very important part of our agricultural sector had worked out on their own. I regret that is not in this legislation. 
   There are a number of other things I would prefer to see included, and as a consequence I was disappointed that the conferees were not able to complete their work. Nonetheless, this is an extremely important piece of legislation for Nebraska. I appreciate in the Northeast there are some concerns there may not be a sufficient amount of resources in this bill to satisfy concerns, but the problem, of course, is that most of the disaster occurs as a consequence of problems with low prices that are affecting the feed grain section, and rice and cotton as well. That is where the big money is. Most of the crops are not grown in the Northeast and that tends to produce apparent inequities. There 
   is almost nothing we can do about that kind of inequity. 
   In the legislation I appreciate the inclusion of mandatory price reporting. The chairman and I had a little colloquy on that a year or so ago. I appreciate that being included in this legislation. A great deal of effort has been made in the meantime since last year's Agriculture appropriations bill between lots of different sectors of the involved economy: the livestock producers, packers, and feedlot operators. I appreciate that is in the legislation because I think it is a very important part of trying to make the market work to enable people who are running cow-calf operations and feedlot operations to get good price discovery. It is simply a way to ensure that the restructuring that is going on in the industry doesn't prevent the kind of price discovery needed in order to get a good market functioning. 
   Last, I think this growing requirement to come back to Congress to fund disaster programs underscores the urgency of reexamining the Freedom to Farm contract that was not supposed to expire until 2002. Remember, in 1996, we promised the Freedom to Farm bill would be a lot less expensive than previous farm bills. We have already spent more than we anticipated for the entire 7 years of the program in the first 4 years alone. Obviously, we are not done. We are heading to a point where we will spend as much as we did at the peak of the 1980s. 
   Talking to farmers where I come from in Nebraska, I am hard pressed to find many that think Freedom to Farm has worked. They are not very enthusiastic about getting another big check from the Government. They would rather have modifications in the farm bill similar to what the Nebraska corn growers presented to the House agricultural committee hearing in Nebraska, saying bring back the farmer loan reserve, uncap the loan rates, make some adjustments in the center on trade, on sanctions. There are lots of things that can be done to make the program better. My hope as we consider this additional disaster payment is that we understand there is a way to operate this farm program and spend a lot less money. 
   In all the talk about the failed farm policies of the past, we never spent more than $6 billion a year through the 1970s when we had a system called normal crop acreage. It was not the heavy hand of government. There was a single base planted; farmers had flexibility coming in. If farmers wanted to have Freedom to Farm, they didn't have to sign up for the farm program. It ought to be voluntary. We had a program in the 1970s that was a lot more efficient, a lot less costly, and a lot more flexible for the farmer. This is getting more and more complicated, more and more difficult, with more and more trips to the Farm Service Agency than anybody anticipated. 
   My hope, as we debate this conference report, is that one of the things we start to consider is that in 2000 the Senate Agriculture Committee needs to take up, as the House Agriculture Committee will do, the question of whether or not we ought to rewrite Freedom to Farm in order to not only save the family farm but also to save the taxpayer getting repeatedly hit for the bills of agricultural disasters that may not be created by Freedom to Farm. 
   I see my good friend down here, Senator ROBERTS of Kansas. He heard me talking about Freedom to Farm and he rushed to the floor to defend himself. I am not saying that Freedom to Farm has caused the problem. I am simply saying I do think it is time to reexamine it. We should do it in a calm and bipartisan fashion. This Freedom to Farm is getting more and more expensive with fewer and fewer satisfied customers. 
   Last, I also hope the Senate Agriculture Committee will be able to resolve some differences that we have over crop insurance and we can enact crop insurance reform yet this year. The Senate conference with the House has already taken action. This is by no means the only thing we need to do to help people manage the risk, but Senator ROBERTS and I have listened to farmers, written a bill, we have almost 20 cosponsors, a majority of people on the Agriculture Committee. The distinguished chairman of the committee has some terrific ideas, as well, incorporated in his legislation. 
   My hope is, with 14 legislative days remaining, we can pass that out of the Senate Agriculture Committee and take it up on the floor, pass it here, get it to conference with the House, and get that signed and on to the President. There is money in the budget to do it. There is money in the disaster program to make it easier for people to afford the premiums. 
   It is consistent with what most of us have been talking about in terms of trying to give the farmers something they can use to manage their risk. 
   I say finally, I appreciate very much the difficulty the distinguished chairman of this subcommittee has had. Senator COCHRAN had no easy task of trying to produce a conference report. There are things in it I would love to change. I know I cannot change them. But I will vote for this legislation and hope the President will sign it and hope it gets into law as quickly as possible so cash can get into the hands of people who desperately need it in order to survive.

   Mr. KERREY. I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee for their continued support for community health centers and other programs within the consolidated health centers account. I firmly believe that these centers represent the best investment the Federal government can make in health care for under-served populations and under-served areas. These centers provide an invaluable service to our communities and our citizens--they provide comprehensive primary and preventive services to a broad spectrum of persons without health insurance and members of under-served populations. I note that the bill before us increases funding for these centers by nearly $100 million, and exceeds the President's request by $79 million. 
   It is my hope that the Department of Health and Human Services will use at least part of this new funding to establish new community health centers to address the needs of under-served populations. I am particularly interested in guaranteeing that a proposal from the Indian-Chicano Health Center of Omaha, Nebraska, be fully and fairly considered during any review of new health center applications. This organization has made an extraordinary effort to serve a unique community of low-income, uninsured Nebraskans who otherwise would go without health care.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from Georgia and the Senator from New Jersey if I can split my time because though I do support the amendment of the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, I have an unusual argument. It may sound as if I am both for it and against it. I appreciate him yielding time to me. 
   It is terribly important we do save Social Security, but my frustration in the entire Social Security debate is to date, what has happened is the Social Security issue has prevented us from increasing discretionary spending and getting a budget that meets the needs of the American people. It has prevented us from doing a tax cut of any kind, whether it is $300 billion or $500 billion or $700 billion. It has prevented us from doing Medicare reform. It locked us up in a box. 
   We cannot seem to get anything done because we are not willing to fix Social  Security. We want to have the issue, but when we get down to the details of the problem, it is not an easy problem to solve because we basically--not basically--we have a liability on the table that is about 33 percent larger than what current taxes will fund. That is the problem. 
   For 150 million Americans under the age of 45, that means they are going to face a benefit cut of between 25 and 33 percent. Thus, the announcements recently sent out by Mr. Apfel, the head of the Social Security Administration, are not accurate. He is telling people how much money they are going to get if Congress raises taxes. The last time I checked, there is not a single vote in this body to raise payroll taxes. If that is the case, it is likely to be every beneficiary under the age of 45 is going to be looking at a pretty substantial benefit cut. That is the problem we have to address. 
   There are a number of legislative proposals that have been introduced, but, again, relevant to this debate, you would think everybody is about to fix Social Security. The lockbox does not fix Social Security. All it does is use the payroll tax to pay down the debt. After having used the payroll tax to keep the deficit low for 16 years, we are now saying to Americans who get paid by the hour: You get the pleasure of reducing all the debt. 
   For the median family of $37,000 a year, they will pay about $5,500 in payroll taxes versus $1,300 or $1,400 in income taxes. It is not, in my view, a very fair transaction. 
   If we enact Social Security legislation, it could be a very good transaction because we could do tax reduction for those families. We could help them on the discretionary side helping their children go to college by doing some things as well to make certain their kids get a good education in our K-12 system. There are a lot of good things that could occur if we fix Social Security. 
   There are only 29 Members of Congress who have signed on to any specific legislation at all. I call that to the attention of those who are watching this debate because, again, one would think, given all the interest in Social Security, they were about to pass Social Security reform legislation. 
   Earlier today, the chairman of the Finance Committee had a meeting in which he was discussing the need to extend some tax provisions, the R&D tax credit most specifically, but also making some changes in the individual alternative minimum tax, a very unfair and pretty heavy tax on working families that have multiple deductions. 
   We were talking about that, and I suggested to the chairman 
   that the Finance Committee take up Social Security reform; let's mark up the bill. There is a majority on the committee who would vote for a specific piece of legislation. It is not likely we are going to. 
   As I see it, the Republicans are a little bit distrustful of what the President might do. The President has a proposal on the table that takes $25 trillion of income taxes to extend Social Security solvency for 20 years. Republicans, I believe, have correctly identified that as a mistaken way to sort of fix Social Security. 
   I am willing to join with Republicans in that regard and hope, as we debate these various proposals, that enthusiasm will grow as a consequence of looking at what is happening to 150 million beneficiaries who will not be eligible for another 20, 30, or 40 years. What happens to them if we do not take action? They are the ones who are going to pay a price. The terrible paradox about that is not only are they going to pay a price with delay, but the lockbox basically says to them: You are going to shoulder the burden for debt reduction until we finally come to grips with this particular problem. 
   Time is not on our side. The problem does not get easier. If you favor tax increases, the tax increases will be larger the longer you wait. If you favor cutting benefits, the benefit cuts get bigger the longer you wait. If you favor, as I do and a number of us in the Senate, making some modest reduction in benefits but coupling that with increased payments for lower-wage individuals and the establishment of savings accounts that would enable individuals, in combination with a defined benefit program, to actually get more than what is currently promised--with either one of those three proposals, the longer you wait, the more the beneficiaries and taxpayers are going to suffer. It does not get easier for them. It gets harder for them. It may be easier for us as we head to elections, but it is not easier for the American people to watch this debate get locked up over this lockbox issue, seeing who favors saving Social Security the most. It does not benefit the American people for us not to enact legislation that will fix Social Security.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I support the legislation offered earlier by the Senator from South Dakota, the Medicare Beneficiary Access to Care Act of 1999. 
   I supported strongly the balanced budget amendment of 1997, the deficit reduction acts of 1993 and 1990, and am proud of the supporting role I played over the last 7 or 8 years in taking the United States of America to the point where the Federal Government was borrowing hundreds of billions of dollars--$300 billion when I came in 1989--to a point where we now have a surplus. It is quite an exciting change in the dynamics of this country. 
   This morning's New York Times had a story by Louis Uchitelle about 1.1 million Americans having been lifted off the rolls of poverty as a consequence of demands of wages that occur because interest rates are low, corporate profits are good, and the American economy is as strong as it has been in my lifetime. It is quite impressive what a strong economy will do with low interest rates and what increased rates in productivity will do. The report also pointed out the significant problems we still have with income growth, especially with African Americans. 
   But I am proud of the role I played in eliminating the deficit and creating a surplus that has contributed enormously to the growth of the U.S. economy. Certainly lots of action in the private sector contributed to it, but Congress and those who were here--Republicans and Democrats--over the last 7 or 8 years who voted for these three pieces of legislation can take some pride in taking the United States not just into recovery economically, but I remember how frustrating the deficit was--politically frustrating--that caused Americans to lose confidence that Congress could get anything done. It seemed a relatively small ``bone'' in a great nation and I am glad we finally coughed it up. I don't want to backtrack on that. 
   That is why I am pleased Senator DASCHLE has indicated this bill has to be paid for. Not only do we have to be careful to not drain the Social Security trust fund, but we have to be careful we not do this in a fashion that takes America back to the bad old days of deficit financing. It is easy to do that. 
   The 1997 act had an impressive number of people in the Senate and the House voting for the legislation. The United States was to produce $100 million of savings in 10 years. It is now estimated it will produce $200 million in savings. I voted for $100 million. That is what I thought the legislation would produce. Not all of that $200 million estimate occurs as a consequence of the changes in reimbursement. Some has occurred as a result of the vigorous effort by Secretary Shalala and HCFA to reduce fraud and, as a consequence, save taxpayer money. They made billing changes that produced some savings. They are doing a better job of  managing the taxpayers' money. Some of the savings has occurred as a consequence. 
   There is no question there is a fraction of that excess $100 million that has come as a result of our making some changes to take more out of the providers than anyone anticipated. This legislation will put $23 billion back. I believe that is fair, reasonable, and defendable. I think it will have a tremendously positive impact on the ability of my State of Nebraska to get high-quality health care; that is what is at stake. What is at stake is not just the health of health care institutions but the health of the citizens of the country who depend upon those institutions. 
   I believe this piece of legislation is needed. It is needed in Nebraska and by citizens who depend upon their doctors, who depend upon their hospitals, who depend upon this thing we call the health care system in the United States of America. It is an issue of life and death for them. It is a very important issue. It is a very personal issue. 
   When we talk to somebody in a hospital, it is easy to acquire the right sense of urgency to overcome whatever ideological differences we might have. The people of Nebraska need this Congress to act. It is not just something that we are being asked to do; it is something that is necessary in order to improve the quality of life in our State. 
   I will go through some of the things this legislation does. For hospitals, the 1997 act cuts hospital payments in several ways: Lower inpatient payments; a new outpatient prospective payment system; a special payments cut for low-income patients: and cuts in graduate medical education. 
   This legislation does not restore all of those cuts. It creates a 3-year transition period to protect hospitals under this new outpatient system, and there is additional protection for rural and cancer hospitals. The bill also moderates the cut in DSH and GME payments, a central concern of teaching and academic centers. And it takes action for pediatric hospitals. 
   I urge colleagues who have not studied this to examine the very low reimbursements for graduate medical education for pediatric hospitals. There is a glaring difference and it will create tremendous problems as we try to train pediatricians--a very important profession in the health care industry. 
   There are a number of changes that increase the quality of care in Nebraska hospitals and increase the chances, especially in rural hospitals, that we will not see a continuation of what we had in 1998 when two rural hospitals closed. My hospital administrators tell me there may be more of the same unless we make some reasonable adjustments. 
   The Balanced Budget Act made some changes in skilled nursing facilities. We understand the need to balance the budget. This does not undo that. It is paid for. The Balanced Budget Act created a prospective payment system for skilled nursing facilities. This does not adequately account for the costs of very sick patients and rare high-cost services. This bill attempts to address both of these problems by increasing payments for groups of patients for whom payment is low and by paying separately for high-cost services, such as prosthetics, to ensure the nursing homes receive adequate payment. 
   We have heard about the impact of therapy caps. I hope in addition to putting some money back into the providers, we can take the advice of the Senator from Oklahoma and get some structural changes enacted in Medicare. One of the problems we have as a Congress trying to make changes in Medicare is we don't know the full impact of changes. 
   Senators BREAUX and THOMAS were proposing the creation of a new Senate-confirmed board that has authority over HCFA to make certain HCFA has the authority to offer fee-for-service plans on a competitive basis and make sure competitors have a level playing field to compete and offer their plans against the fee for service that HCFA has. I think it would be easier to solve the problem of dealing with waste, fraud, and abuse and make it more likely the consumers receive good information when they are trying to make decisions about what to buy. Consolidating Part A and Part B was also in the proposal of Senator BREAUX, and as a consequence of consolidating those two programs, it would make it much more likely when dealing with medical procedures, such as therapy, that we get it right. 
   What we did with the Balanced Budget Act is create a 1,500-per-annual-beneficiary cap, but these are arbitrary. They don't allow any flexibility based upon the need of the patient. What we have done with the legislation is repeal the caps until 2003 and require HCFA to implement a new system for therapy payments that is budget neutral to caps. It is designed to address the needs for varying amounts of therapy based upon a patient's condition. That is the point I was trying to make earlier, why we need structural changes, as well. 
   There are varying needs of the patient that are extremely difficult for HCFA to address. It is a central system. They have fiscal intermediaries in the country making payments. It is still a centrally controlled system and awfully difficult to get it right in Ohio, Nebraska, and Missouri simultaneously. They have to apply a system nationwide. It is better, in my judgment, if we have a board of directors, Senate-confirmed, to manage HCFA, moving in a direction where the private sector is able to compete for HCFA's fee for service simultaneously, with HCFA offering its fee-for-service plans. 
   It makes changes in home health. We created under the BBA an interim payment system for home health agencies which limits payments on both a per beneficiary as well as a per visit basis. The temporary system locked in very low rates. This affects 
   rural areas more than urban areas. There are very low rates for areas that had traditionally low costs such as Nebraska. We have low costs. 
   The IPS locked in those very low costs in October 2000, and the IPS is scheduled to be replaced by a new PPS system for home health services. Those payments will be reduced in an arbitrary fashion by 15 percent. We make three changes in the legislation that are vital: First, we postpone this 15-percent cut for 2 years; second, we assist low-cost agencies that have been disadvantaged under the IPS by increasing the per visit limit; finally, the bill reduce administrative burdens placed upon the providers by eliminating interest on overpayments, eliminating a 15-minute reporting requirement, and eliminating a requirement for home health agencies to do the billing for durable medical equipment. 
   We make changes for physicians. The BBA created a new system for physician payments based on a target rate of growth. The system includes bonus payments and reductions intended to create incentives to meet the target rate of growth. However, what we have done will cause payments to fluctuate widely, creating tremendous uncertainty in the physician communities and causing physicians who are out there trying to manage a clinic or their business to say: We can't depend upon HCFA. We can't depend upon a revenue stream. There is too much uncertainty in the system. We may opt out as a consequence. 
   They are facing a very big challenge in dealing with HCFA's representation that there may be fraud when, in fact, all that has occurred is there are a number of additional changes that will be very constructive for physicians, for Medicare+Choice, for rural health clinics, federally qualified health centers, and for hospice care where we have not had any rebasing of payments since 1982. It is a $1 billion--an extremely important program. 
   Unfortunately, we do not pay a lot of attention to the problem we are facing when individuals know for certain they are dying. Hospice addresses that. This is an important change, in my view, and I urge colleagues on both sides of the aisle to say, whether it is with the Daschle bill, which I support, or a bill that comes out of the Finance Committee, which I am apt to support as well: This is one of the things we need to do. We need to get this done. 
   I hope we can at least get some minimal changes in Medicare as well, but we need to address this.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I heard an exchange earlier between the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Oklahoma who talked about raiding the Social Security trust fund. We have not been raiding the Social Security trust fund for the last 16 years. What we have--since 1983--is a tax that generates revenue in excess of what we need. The law says we have to take that tax and purchase Treasury bonds. When the Treasury is purchasing Treasury bonds from itself, Treasury ends up with cash. 
   The question is--since 1983--what do we do with that cash? We have been using it to fund general government, and the impact of that since 1983 is that people who get paid by the hour are the ones who suffer. We make this appeal to people over the age of 65 for political reasons: Do not raid Social Security. But the people who suffer and have been paying the price since 1983 are the American taxpayers, people who get paid by the hour. For the median-income family earning $37,000 a year, they will pay $5,700 in payroll taxes and $1,300 or $1,400 in income taxes. Since 1983, they have shouldered a disproportionate share of deficit reduction. Now that the deficit is gone, guess what they get to do. They get to shoulder all the debt reduction. This does not save Social Security. What this does is save us from having to make a change. That puts a tremendous burden upon people who are paid by the hour. 
   What we ought to be doing is debating reducing that burden, not, in my judgment, making a play for people over the age of 65 and saying we have been raiding the trust. We have not. We 
   have not been raiding the trust fund since 1983. The trust fund has been building up, and those Treasury bonds are valuable. They earn interest. In fact, there is $40 billion worth of interest added on to the Social Security trust this year as a result of paying for the interest on those bonds. 
   The people who suffer as a consequence of Congress' delay on fixing Social Security are 150 million Americans under the age of 45. If you are under the age 45 and you are watching Congress say, ``Let's fix Social Security'' and do nothing, what you ought to be saying is: Mr. Congressman, when are you going to fix it? 
   Why do we not fix it? You can see it. I was watching the news this morning. I saw Ken Apfel, the head of the Social Security Administration, in an interview with Katie Couric, proudly telling about a letter he is sending out to Social Security beneficiaries telling them what they are going to get when they retire. He left one thing out. If they are under 45 and they get a letter in the mail that says ``this is what your benefits are going to be,'' Mr. Apfel is not informing those beneficiaries that unless Congress increases taxes, there is going to be a 25- to 33-percent cut in benefits, according to the Social Security trustees. He is not informing them of that, and he is not informing them that Social Security, for that low- and moderate-wage individual, is not a very generous program. If you live very long after the age of 65, God help you if that is all you have. 
   Those of us who have been arguing we need to fix Social Security get a little irritated when we hear people say we have been raiding Social Security for the last 16 years and that the lockbox saves Social Security. It does not. What the lockbox does is say to people who are paid by the hour, the median family who has $5,700 in payroll taxes, after shouldering all the burden for deficit reduction from 1983 to 1999, it is now their responsibility to pay down the debt. On behalf of those people, to keep Social Security as an intergenerational program, I beg my colleagues to finally decide: What will you support? 
   I went to the University of Nebraska, graduated with a degree in pharmacy, and was trained in demolitions in the U.S. Navy. I do not consider myself to be an intellectual giant. I am neither a Rhodes scholar nor some sort of scholastic achiever. I do not consider myself to be intellectually superior to anybody in this place. An average staffer with an hour's worth of work can present to any Member of Congress the options that are available to us. This is not complicated. This is not youth violence. This is not the deterioration of the American family. This is not lots of issues that are complicated. 
   We have a liability that is too big, and for 150 million beneficiaries who are now charged with the responsibility of paying down all the debt with their payroll taxes, they face a 25- to 33-percent cut in their benefits. We are not keeping the promise to them, and we are making an appeal to people over the age of 65, saying: The lockbox saves you. Nonsense, it does not. 
   I know how difficult it is to finally say this is what I choose because you either have to increase taxes or you cut benefits. There are no other magical choices. There is not any other choice. You either cut the benefits in the future or you increase taxes. I wish there were some other choice, but there is not. 
   I hope Americans, as they hear this debate about raiding Social Security, will understand we are not, in my view, raiding Social Security. What we are saying is that we are going to postpone fixing Social Security because we are afraid of people over the age of 65. We are afraid they cannot stomach the truth. I believe that is wrong. They can stomach the truth. They want to know the truth. They want the facts. They are patriotic; they love their country; they love their kids and grandkids; and they want to make certain their future is secure and sound and that Social Security is going to be there for them when they become eligible. 
   I hope we are able to take action on the Balanced Budget Restoration Act that Senator DASCHLE has introduced. But I hope in this budget debate as well, we will finally recognize the sooner we fix Social Security, the smaller the changes will have to be. The people who are going to suffer the consequences today may not be us. We may be able to get by the next election by fooling people about what we are doing. But the people who are going to suffer are 150 million Americans under  the age of 45 who are not going to be happy when they wake up on Christmas morning and go down and check the sock and find out there is a third less in it than they were told, by the Social Security Administration, was going to be in it. 
   Mr. President, I appreciate your indulgence and I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. Yes, it would be my pleasure. On March 31, 1999, I requested that $1.5 million be appropriated within the CDBG program's Economic Development Initiative for the North 27th Street Center for Children and Youth in Lincoln, NE. The Center is being developed by Cedars Youth Services, Inc. at the request of the City of Lincoln. The Federal dollars would be used by Cedars to develop, operate, and implement a program for the collaborative provision of services by several organizations through a design that will allow participants to avoid having to negotiate the administration and service delivery practices of the various organizations. In other words, it is an effort to develop a ``one-stop'' service center for youth programs. 
   In addition, during March 1999, I also requested $750,000 or Project Jericho in Omaha, NE to be used by Family Housing Advisory Services for the ongoing administration and operation of Project Jericho. Project Jericho assists individuals, couples, and families who qualify for Section 8 assistance to locate safe affordable housing in the Omaha area. Financial management and mobility counseling are provided to help participants who want to find rental properties in neighborhoods with less than 35 percent minority population. Project Jericho is now one of the top recognized mobility programs in the country. 
   Finally, I requested that $120,000 be provided from the Environmental Programs and Management Account of the EPA, to the Fontenelle Forest Association for the Missouri River Ecology Institute (MREI). Fontenelle Forest would use the funds to continue MREI, which provides an intensive, six week summertime experience in field-based natural science for teenagers (primarily students entering the 10th grade). MREI services as a leadership development initiative for students with a strong interest in the environment, and includes activities to help prepare them for future careers in this field.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senator HAGEL in introducing the Missouri River Basin, Middle Loup Division Project Facilities Conveyance Act. 
   The bill provides for the transfer of title of irrigation project facilities and lands from the Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Department of Interior to the Middle Loup Division irrigation districts in central Nebraska. These districts have operated the facilities there for over 35 years. 
   The project facilities are part of the Missouri River Basin Project, and provide water from the Middle Loup River to over 64,000 acres of irrigable land, as well as providing recreating and fish and wildlife benefits. Principal features of the projects include the Sherman Dam and Reservoir, the Arcadia Diversion Dam, the Milburn Diversion Dam, irrigation canals and laterals, drains and pumping plants. 
   Crops grown on these irrigated lands primarily include alfalfa, small grains, sugar beets, and corn to provide feed for a thriving livestock-feeding economy in my state of Nebraska, which includes beef cattle, hogs, and poultry. 
   In 1995, the Vice President indicated that the Bureau of Reclamation of the U.S. Department of Interior should transfer titles to allow local ownership of irrigation projects such as this. The Bureau has indicated to me that this project is a top candidate for title transfer to be achieved. This transfer also has the support of Nebraska's Game and Parks Commission as well as the Middle Loup Public Power and Irrigation District. When this legislation passes, Nebraska will become the first state where title transfer efforts have been successful.

   Mr. KERREY. Yes, it would be my pleasure. The State of Nebraska requires $2,432,000 for road improvements to provide access to the Boyer Chute National Wildlife Refuge near Fort Calhoun, Nebraska. Currently, the road that leads to Boyer Chute through Washington County is unpaved. This road is an important thoroughfare and is the most direct route to Boyer Chute. Boyer Chute has become an increasingly popular recreation area and tourist destination. Traffic on the current road has increased and will continue to increase as the National Wildlife continues its expansion next year. Paving the road will greatly improve access to this national treasure--and will be of great benefit to Nebraskans.

    Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to provide enhanced incentives for charitable giving. 
   I very much believe that we ought to do what we can to encourage those who are doing so well in this economy to give generously to organizations who serve those who have been left behind in these prosperous times. I worked to have a number of charitable giving provisions included in the Senate version of the tax bill we passed earlier this year and was delighted that those provisions were included in that bill. Regrettably these provisions were deleted from the final version of the tax bill, something which contributed to my decision to vote against the conference report on that bill. The bill I am introducing today is a stand-alone version of the charitable giving provisions that I was proud to have worked to include in the Senate version of the tax bill. 
   The purpose of this bill is simple: to provide powerful incentives for those who have more to give to those who have less. 
   The first provision in this bill would allow taxpayers some extra time to decide to make donations to low-income schools in a given tax year. Under current law individuals can already take charitable deductions for contributions to public and private schools. Clearly, wealthier schools, where parents have the resources to make these contributions, benefit most from this tax treatment. 
   What this provision attempts to do is highlight the fact that a charitable deduction can be taken for these types of donations generally while providing an incentive for giving to low-income private and public schools in particular. Since the parents in these schools are low-income, this provision is not aimed at getting them to give--it is aimed at getting taxpayers outside of these low-income schools to help the children in those schools. Wealthier public and private schools already get these contributions, this provision attempts to get some contributions going to schools where more than half of the children are economically disadvantaged. 
   This provision tracks the way we allow contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts, IRAs, to be made. Under current law, taxpayers can make contributions to an IRA up until the date their taxes are due--April 15--and still have those contributions qualify for the previous taxable year. This provision would simply allow contributions to low income elementary and secondary schools to be made up until April 15--thereby highlighting and encouraging taxpayers to make these contributions. 
   The second provision in this bill allows taxpayers who do not itemize their deductions, to take a small deduction for charitable contributions. Across the country, seventy-three percent of all taxpayers do not itemize and therefore are not able to take a charitable deduction. In Nebraska, that number is even higher, a full seventy-eight percent of Nebraska's taxpayers do not itemize. This bill would allow a single taxpayer who does not itemize a $50 deduction and taxpayers filing jointly a $100 charitable deduction. While this provision may not cover all of the charitable giving that these individuals and families make, it recognizes and encourages charitable 
   giving by people who may not give a million dollars, but give donations that are meaningful nonetheless to good causes like their church or synagogue, or their children's PTA, or the Girl Scouts or the Salvation Army. We ought to encourage that giving and provide a small incentive to do so. That is the purpose behind this provision. 
   The legislation I am introducing today also raises the percentage amount of income that an individual may deduct in a given year from 50 percent of their adjusted gross income to 75 percent. It also raises the limits on gifts of capital gain property to charities from 30 percent to 50 percent. In  addition, this bill increases the corporate charitable deduction limit from 10 to 20 percent of taxable income. 
   These provisions are designed to encourage those who give a lot, to give even more. While I recognize that those who receive these tax benefits are apt to be higher-income taxpayers, I also recognize that the charities that will receive these increased donations are apt to use these donations to help low-income individuals. In short, I'm not overly troubled by distributional tables on a policy which will induce those with more to give to those who need help the most. 
   And finally, this bill contains an important reform of what is known as the excess business holdings rule. That rule limits the ability of a private foundation to hold more than twenty percent of a corporation's voting stock for more than five years. At present, I believe this rule discourages potential donors with major stockholdings in publicly-trade corporate stock from making significant contributions of these holdings to charitable foundations. This is just the opposite of what we should be doing, particularly at a time when we are expecting more, not less, from organizations with charitable purposes. The proposal I have included in this bill would allow private foundations to increase their holding in publicly traded stock of a corporation received by bequest from 20 percent to 49 percent. 
   Taken together I believe these proposals do much to encourage people to give more. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and hope that it will be included in any broad tax legislation that we consider.

   Mr. KERREY. I rise today with my good friend and colleague, Senator HAGEL, to talk about a very important and worthwhile project, the Mari Sandoz High Plains Heritage Center in Chadron, Nebraska. 
   Mari Sandoz was a world-renowned and internationally-acclaimed writer, born and raised in the Nebraska Sand Hills. Drawing on her childhood experiences and her research at the Nebraska State Historical Society, Sandoz wrote passionately and poetically about life on the Great Plains. Her works dealt with the early fur traders, the Plains Indians, the cattlemen and ranchers, the immigrant homesteaders, and the persecution of the Northern Cheyenne and Ogallala Sioux. Through her writing, Sandoz played an important role in the cultural preservation of the Western Nebraska of the 1800s and early 1900s. Preserving her works and her legacy is a way of preserving our own cultural heritage.

   Mr. KERREY. I thank the Senator from New York very much. 
   I am sorry I didn't wear the same necktie that he did. Other than that, we are deeply matched. 
   Mr. President, first I want to compliment Chairman ROTH. I believe all through the Finance Committee deliberations and last week on the Senate floor he held true to two ideas that I share. 
   The first is that we can cut taxes. The second is we must do so fairly. Indeed, the net effect of cutting taxes by nearly $800 billion over ten years is to give the American people an $800 billion increase in their after-tax income. I believe we can do it safely. We have $3 trillion in surpluses forecast over the next ten years. And I don't believe that cutting taxes will generate inflation if done correctly. 
   In his original package, the Chairman held true to the idea that some standard of fairness need be applied in how the income tax cuts would be distributed. He attempted to do that. Doing that caused him a little grief on his side of the aisle. I appreciate very much what the chairman attempted to do with his original tax cut package. 
   Accordingly, I voted for the package enthusiastically on the floor. I believe it was a good proposal. I may have written it a little differently if I were the one who was doing the writing. But I thought it was a balanced proposal and a good proposal, and I was fully supportive of it. I was one of four Democrats to do so. 
   Thus, I come to the floor with some regret. I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle that you should know that people like me took a position that said we were prepared to vote for a tax cut of $800 billion. The Chairman's original package received 57 votes on this floor. I understand the other side has been working all night to get the votes to pass the package we have before us and I suspect the most votes this package will receive is 52. So I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, if you are trying to get a piece of legislation passed to try to change the law and give Americans an income tax cut, you are going in the wrong direction. With the President threatening to veto the bill, it seems to me that a better approach would have been to try to get more votes, not fewer. 
   I am here, regrettably, to say that I will not only change my vote from an enthusiastic ``aye,'' but I will now change and be voting enthusiastically ``no.'' Let me tell my colleagues why. 
   First of all, I want to identify some things that are in this package that I think would be good. I appreciated very much the chairman fighting for them and getting them into the bill, and I am fully supportive of them. 
   Eliminating the marriage penalty is terribly important. There are new provisions in here which will make it more likely that Americans will save and will have the resources they need for retirement. There are provisions in here which will make it more likely that Americans will have health insurance, and that will make it more likely that Americans will be able to afford the cost of higher education. 
   I do not object at all to eliminating the inheritance tax. I cosponsored legislation to do that. I am not going to take a great deal of time explaining why, as a Democrat, I reached that conclusion. I am prepared, if anybody is interested, in debating it at a later time. 
   I am not ideologically opposed to lowering the capital gains tax. 
   There are many things in this proposal that I, in short, like or don't have strong objections to. It is this test of fairness 
   which I believe was applied to the Senate version that I find lacking in the conference report. 
   Let me take the one provision that is the most important provision in the Senate version. 
   The provision that cut the lowest tax rate on income from 15 to 14 percent that was in the Senate finance bill would have cut taxes for families in Nebraska with an income of $46,000, for a family of four, by $440. It would have cut taxes on a U.S. Senator with a spouse and two kids by $440 as well. That was the idea. 
   I am not interested in engaging in class warfare. I have no quarrel with upper-income Americans or upper-income Nebraskans. Quite the contrary. In Nebraska, there were 775,000 federal income tax returns in 1996. Of that, 6,500 had adjusted gross incomes of over $200,000. That is a relatively small number. But they paid almost a third of all the $3.6 billion in federal taxes paid by Nebraskans. 
   So I am not here to say that upper-income people don't deserve a tax break. I think it is very important for us to take a look at America and try to discern which taxpayers are most in need of help. It is, it seems to me, a fair question for us to ask. And to try to apply a standard of fairness, it seems to me, is something we ought to be doing. 
   Under last week's proposal, a single Member of Congress, I would have gotten a $260 tax rate cut, just as a single person with $26,000 of income. But under this proposal, by decreasing the taxes for everyone at higher rates as well, a Member of Congress, a single Member such as myself, I am going to get a tax cut of $1,185. I get over $900 more under this proposal. And if I got married, I would do even better. 
   I can make an argument that because I am paying more taxes I ought to get more of a tax cut. But look at households. A family of four with $46,000 worth of income probably ought to have a larger tax cut than I do. At the very least, I should not receive more than they do. That is what I mean when I say that this bill, when it passed here last week, met the minimal standard of fairness. 
   I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle that if you are trying to figure out how to get more votes and not fewer, you have now figured out how to get fewer. You had 57 votes on this side last week. The high water mark today, in my view, is likely to be 52. I understand that the conference report had to be reopened in the later  hours of yesterday evening and some provisions had to be put in to woo some votes for a bare majority. I know there were some concerns that the Vice President might be sitting up there at the end of business today and there might be no more than 50 votes for this legislation. All of that should be a sign. You had 57 votes. Yesterday you did not have 50. Something is going in the wrong direction. 
   I believe a majority of Democrats and Republicans in chamber, want to apply a standard of fairness. The distinguished junior Senator from Texas, offered an amendment on this floor last week that would increase the standard deduction for a married couple. Why did she want to eliminate the marriage penalty for people who are using the standard deduction? It got a lot of Democratic votes and a lot of Republicans votes. Indeed, I think it was the only amendment that actually broke the 60-vote requirement. That is a clue. That was a fairness issue and the junior Senator wanted that fairness applied to married people who take the standard deduction, people who do not itemize, people who are generally not in the upper reaches of income in this country. 
   I'm not talking about crafting a social engineering package. What I am talking about is applying a standard of fairness. 
   As I said, I have great respect for the chairman of the Finance Committee. I believe he attempted to apply a standard of fairness, and, in my judgment, his package of last week passed that test. I voted for it enthusiastically. But the conference 
   committee report does not pass that test. It does not pass the test of fairness. 
   So I enthusiastically and confidently will vote ``no'' on it. I do so regrettably because I believe there was an opportunity this year not just to do this but to get a bipartisan solution on Medicare and to get a bipartisan solution on Social Security. The package before us today does not bode well for future bipartisan efforts to come up with those solutions. 
   This bill had 57 votes last week. As I said, were it not for the sort of last-minute work to try to have some changes to get some additional votes, it might not have even 50 votes later today when we will have a vote on final passage. 
   I say to my Republican friends, if you want to cut Americans' taxes, listen not just to what Democrats are saying but also listen to what Republicans are saying. They want a standard of fairness applied. It is a legitimate concern. 
   I don't know how many Members of the Senate believe that $800 billion is too much. I believe the distinguished occupant of the Chair does. He fought very hard as mayor and Governor, and I think he is coming to this Congress saying we ought to be careful not to spend the surplus and lose all the progress that we have made. Fine. Make that argument. 
   But for the majority of us who believe that $800 billion is not too much, if we want to persuade our reluctant colleagues to support cutting taxes for American families, then you have to apply a standard of fairness, a test of fairness. You may not like doing it. You may believe your ideology tells you that you should do something else. But if you want to change the law and get this done, you had darned sure better do it, because not only will you not get the strong majority you will need but you will never, in my judgment, get the President of United States to sign a piece of legislation that doesn't attempt to measure and apply some test of fairness. 
   Again, I appreciate very much the work that the distinguished chairman did, Senator ROTH of Delaware, as well as the ranking Democrat, Senator MOYNIHAN. I appreciate very much the leadership of both of them. Senator MOYNIHAN led the Democrats in the committee to come up with a $300 billion tax cut proposal. It had a very key component in there, which was to increase the standard deduction for individuals. That takes a number of people off the income tax rolls, reduces the top tax rate for many and simplifies tax filing for millions. 
   I suggest to my Republican colleagues on the other side of the aisle that if you want to get a bill, that is the kind of proposal that you should have included in this package and it is unfortunate that you did not. It is unfortunate that the centerpiece of the tax proposal that we voted for last week--the reduction of the 15 percent tax rate to 14 percent--was not left alone. If there is a second chance to consider a tax bill this year, I hope we will work harder to pass a bill that will get significant support from this side of the aisle and the way to do that is to ensure a bill meets a basic standard of fairness. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am concerned the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska funding for health services is not adequate to provide these services to tribal members. As the Chairman may know, the Ponca Tribe was terminated in 1962 and restored as a federally recognized Tribe in 1990. At the time of restoration, the Tribe's user population was estimated at 654 and was allocated a $1.2 million budget. 
   In January 1998, the Ponca Tribe established the Ponca Health and Wellness Center in Omaha, Nebraska. This clinic provides quality medical, dental, pharmaceutical, and community outreach health services to members of all federally recognized Tribes. As a result of this new clinic, the user population has increased to over 2000 users without a budget increase to address the larger population. Does the distinguished Senator from Washington agree this problem must be addressed?

   Mr. KERREY. Clearly, the Ponca Tribe needs resources in order to meet the health needs of an increased user population. It is my hope the Indian Health Service (IHS) will address this unusual increase with its resources. I encourage the IHS to provide increased funding to any Tribe that has experienced an increase in the user population of 50 percent or more over fiscal years 1996-99 to the extent possible within existing resources.

   Mr. KERREY. I realize that this year, you and Ranking Member BYRD are facing a challenging appropriations season with tight budgetary constraints. I appreciate your hard work and all that you have done. However, I wanted to bring to your attention a very important project for the State of Nebraska, especially the western part of the state, the Mari Sandoz Cultural Center at Chadron State College in Chadron, Nebraska. Mari Sandoz wrote extensively about the Great Plains--about fur traders and homesteaders, about cattlemen and grangers; about the Cheyenne and Oglala Sioux. She captured in her writings a special time and place. Chadron State College and the Mari Sandoz Society are developing a cultural center to preserve, protect and exhibit a collection that is associated with Mari Sandoz's life and work. I had hoped that we would be able to find $450,000 to assist with this project.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, first of all, I thank both Senator CONRAD from North Dakota and Senator GRASSLEY from Iowa. This is the first bipartisan effort we have had. 
   I also want to key on what the Senator from Mississippi just said. I appreciate very much what the Senator from Mississippi did earlier with the voice vote, basically saying let's try to get some agreement on what our baseline is going to be. 
   I am wondering. I say to the Senator from Mississippi, it seems some things put together in the package by Senators GRASSLEY and CONRAD might be agreeable to the Senator from Mississippi. Perhaps all of them are not. I wonder if the Senator will be willing to consider adding by voice vote some of the things? Look, for example, at the 1999 agricultural disaster losses. That almost on the face cries out for funding, it seems to me. 
   I wonder if the Senator from Mississippi will respond to that. I know earlier we had a voice vote that set down a foundation of what we were going to do. Since this is the first truly bipartisan effort we have had, which is exactly what we are going to need in order to get the President's signature and the House to come along, we have a ways to go before we can get something signed and assistance out to farmers who are in need. 
   As I said, I appreciate very much the Senator from Mississippi--there is no question he understands there is a real need there, and it is not a question of whether or not he wants to help. He has a problem with some of the details of it and the timing of it. I wonder if there is anything on this list that the Senator from Mississippi by voice vote will be able to add in at this stage of the game?

   Mr. KERREY. Let me ask specifically on the ag disaster income loss, it seems to me--this is for 1999 that had been promised previously--this is just a matter of keeping a promise that was made previously. The Senator still would not--he can shake his head no if the answer is no. I am seeking some way to build on what Senator GRASSLEY and Senator CONRAD have done, which is trying to split the difference here and come up with a proposal. 
   Their proposal, for example, the most controversial one right off the bat, was they have all the money going out in an AMTA payment. As the Senator from Mississippi knows, the earlier effort reached by partisan agreement was one of the most difficult issues. Democrats wanted the money to go out in LDPs, and Republicans wanted it to go out in AMTA. We yielded in the bipartisan proposal of which I am fully supportive. It seems to me it would be reasonable at least to consider putting this 1999 assistance that has been promised on the appropriations bill. Does the Senator not agree with that?

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I would like to indicate my strong support for two related research and technology initiatives in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's FY2000 budget--initiatives that were in the President's request, but which have not received any increases in this budget being debated today. The USDA Global Change Research Program and the Climate Change Technology Initiative are two very important programs that deserve additional attention and funding. I recognize that this Congress is faced with many competing funding needs, particularly with the dire situation faced by much of the agriculture community today, but I submit also that we cannot ignore the needs of potential future disasters, especially when the means to avoiding such disaster will benefit U.S. farmers and U.S. agriculture while also benefiting the entire nation. 
   I am referring to the potential effects of global climate change, and the potential for the agriculture sector to cost-effectively and efficiently help us to mitigate against increased concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases. 
   Like many policymakers and many of my colleagues, I am convinced by the data international scientists have amassed that indicates climate change is a phenomenon to be dealt with in order to avoid calamitous effects. I agree with the assessment of the scientific community that we must insure against potentially devastating effects of climate change by taking action now. We are certain that greenhouse gas concentrations have been substantially increasing in the atmosphere, and as those concentrations have increased, global surface temperatures have risen. While we are not sure of the exact nature or extent of the resulting climatic and weather-related disruptions that may occur as the greenhouse effect is intensified, we do know that we should act now. Acting now will benefit the global climate, and the health of our citizens. 
   A significant body of research indicates that there is great potential for U.S. agriculture--for cropland, rangeland, and pastureland, as well as for forests--to sequester carbon at particularly low costs to society. Scientists have shown that with selected management practices, agricultural soils can effectively absorb a large proportion of the annual increases in atmospheric CO2 that are attributed to the greenhouse effect of global climate change. 
   What this means for the U.S. is that we have a cheap, effective sink--a means to sequester a large amount of the carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are being emitted from fossil fuel emissions. The sequestration of carbon in soils is a benefit to agriculture, in addition to society. Increased carbon in soils leads to reduced soil erosion, increased soil tilth and fertility, increased water absorption and retention, and most notably for agriculture, increased productivity. As noted recently by Dr. Rattan Lal, an international soil carbon research scientist--carbon is the basis for all life--including in agricultural soils. Carbon absorption by soils helps agriculture, and helps to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. 
   While we understand a great deal about the means by which carbon is absorbed and retained in soils--for instance through minimal or no-till practices--there is still much that needs to be learned about the entire carbon cycle in nature, and how it moves from one pool, such as soils, to others, such as the atmosphere. We need to better understand the balance of land management and tillage techniques that sequester and retain carbon in soils, and to insure that agricultural policies are supportive of and encourage these activities. Additionally, research is needed to more accurately identify how carbon is lost from soils, either to the atmosphere or elsewhere--and to then identify how best to preserve and retain carbon in the soil sink. 
   What we are looking at is a win-win-win situation--a win for society, a win for the climate, and a win for agriculture. But we must invest now in this future, not only because it will help us to bridge the gap, as we move in the direction of reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and practices that emit greenhouse gases, but it will help us to soften the blow on all other impacted sectors. Using agriculture as a carbon sink helps not only agriculture--it gives all other sectors breathing room to technologically or otherwise adapt to reduced fossil fuel dependence. It will help this country to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions sooner, cheaper, and without the disruptions to businesses and the economy that some sectors have forecast. 
   Mr. President, that is why I want to voice my support for funding the USDA Carbon Cycle Research Program and the Climate Change Technology Initiative. Funding for these important programs is essential to optimize the potential for agriculture and for the climate. I urge that the Senate consider additional funding for these programs.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the pending amendment regarding agricultural sanctions reform. One only has to run a search for legislation regarding sanctions to see that economic sanctions reform has become a key issue for the 106th Congress. I am pleased to be the cosponsor of several pieces of legislation that seek to address the problem of current U.S. sanctions policies. 
   In particular, I am pleased to be the cosponsor of Senator LUGAR's bill, S. 757, which seeks to create a more rational framework for consideration of future U.S. sanctions. While I strongly support the amendment currently pending before the Senate, this is only the first step in addressing economic sanctions reform. It is my hope Congress will continue to work in a bipartisan manner to make our sanctions policy more focused and effective. 
   I am sure it comes as no surprise to my colleagues from farm states that there is a crisis in rural America. It is a crisis that is threatening the very foundations of family-based agriculture. Export markets have shrunk, commodity prices have plummeted, and rural incomes have decreased at an alarming rate. Yet while this is occurring, both Congress and the President have continued to pursue a foreign policy that places restrictions on our agricultural producers, closes off markets, and lowers the value of commodities. 
   Too often, we have used the blunt instrument of unilateral economic sanctions--including restrictions on the sale of U.S. agricultural products--as a simple means to address complex foreign policy problems. These agricultural sanctions end up hurting the most vulnerable in the target country, eroding confidence in the United States as a supplier of food, disrupting our export markets, and placing an unfair burden on America's farmers. 
   Mr. President, I do not mean to suggest we will bring relief to rural America by simply reforming our sanctions policy. The crisis in agriculture is principally a result of the failure--not of our foreign policy--but of our farm policy. It is time to rewrite the farm bill to safeguard producer incomes and to stop the outmigration from our rural communities. Those who argue sanctions are the sole cause of the problems in agriculture fail to realize the challenges we are facing require a more comprehensive solution. However, while we work to improve farm legislation, we cannot continue to ask our farmers to bear the brunt of U.S. foreign policy decisions. 
   The amendment we are currently considering would be a positive first step in addressing sanctions reform. Under current law, agricultural and medicinal products may be included under a sanctions package without any special protections against such actions. However, if this amendment is adopted, agricultural products and medicine would be precluded from any new unilateral sanctions unless the President submits a report to Congress specifically requesting these products be sanctioned. Congress would then have to approve the request by joint resolution. Furthermore, should an agricultural sanction be imposed, it would automatically sunset after two years. Renewal would require a new request from the President and approval by the Congress. 
   This amendment undoubtedly sets a high standard for the imposition of unilateral economic sanctions for food and medicine. It is a standard that seeks to end the practice of using food and medicine as a foreign policy weapon at the expense of our agricultural producers. 
   Mr. President, the strong support we are receiving from commodity groups is a testament to the importance of this amendment to our agricultural producers. Organizations such as the American Soybean Association, the National Corn Growers Association, and the National Association of Wheat Growers--groups that represent America's farmers--support this amendment because they understand the costs and consequences associated with unilateral economic sanctions. 
   Mr. President, this measure will help our agricultural producers by returning some common sense to the imposition of U.S. sanctions. I urge my colleagues to join with the cosponsors of this amendment to take the first step toward economic sanctions reform. 
   Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Delaware, the chairman of the Finance Committee. I rise enthusiastically to speak in favor of the legislation that is before us, the proposal to give Americans a $790 billion increase in our after-tax income. I want to, first of all, address this question about the size, which is one of the things I hear most about when I go home. Can we afford to do it? The distinguished Senator from West Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, has just spoken about that as well. 
   I believe this is a prudent amount. I do not believe this is going to undo the great progress we have made beginning way back in 1990 and the first balanced budget proposal for which I voted. We had another one in 1993, and another in 1997. Taken together, they have all contributed to the elimination of our deficit and the very strong economic growth which we have to be careful not to undo. 
   The Congressional Budget Office, though they obviously will from time to time make mistakes, forecasts that there will be $3 trillion more coming in over the next 10 years than we have in obligated expenditures. While I favor significant debt reduction, I think one would have to imagine some pretty unusual economic circumstances to imagine a downturn in the economy that would eliminate a $3 trillion forecast. It is asked: To what level do we have to get? Does it have to be $5 trillion before we can give the American people back some of their money? 
   This, it seems to me, is a reasonable proposal, a moderate proposal. One could make a case for an even larger cut in taxes, and the best way of illustrating that is if we were to imagine that the budget was balanced and CBO said that over the next 10 years we anticipate exactly the amount of revenue coming in that is needed to meet the expenditures that are forecast, and I walked down here to the floor and offered a piece of legislation to increase taxes $2 trillion, I doubt I would get a single vote. 
   Well, I would actually have to offer a proposal to increase taxes $2.1 trillion to find myself in a situation where we are today. We are talking about reducing the projected surplus from $2.9 trillion down to $2.1 trillion. This is an increase in the after-tax income for the American household. I calculate that, in Nebraska, it means about $4 billion worth of increased income for households that is not taken into Washington, DC. That is a significant amount of money. 
   Not only is there broad-based tax relief in here with a reduction in the rate from 15 to 14 percent, but there are a number of other things that will happen that I consider to be good. We have about 130,000 Nebraskans without health insurance. One of the reasons is that our tax policy doesn't favor an individual who makes a purchase of health insurance. This proposal will enable many of those 130,000 people to be able to afford that because there is an above-the-line deduction in this proposal for individuals. There are 400,000 households in Nebraska that I estimate will benefit from the savings section in the proposal of the distinguished chairman of our committee--people who are trying to figure out how do I save for my own retirement. I know Social Security doesn't provide 
   me with everything I need. I know I need some kind of savings or pension. 
   This has significant reform in our pension laws, making it extremely likely that people right now who don't have pensions for small businesses will have pensions in companies that employ relatively small numbers of people. 
   So in addition to providing $4 billion worth of additional after-tax income to the people of the State of Nebraska, this proposal will also help them save for their retirement. It will result in an increasing number of Nebraskans who  have health insurance, and, in addition, it is going to make it easier for working-class families to send their children to college. 
   There is a deduction here for interest on student loans. One of the most alarming things I see today in the State is the amount of debt students are acquiring in order to be able to get a college degree. It will increase the amount of charitable giving in Nebraska. We have a problem with that today. The charitable giving is flat, and we have questions being asked about how we can increase that amount. This proposal will increase the charitable giving. 
   There are 180,000 Nebraskans who will applaud this piece of legislation because it eliminates the current tax penalty on them as a consequence of their being married. 
   This is a good proposal. 
   There is a $3 trillion surplus being forecast over the next 10 years. 
   This is a moderate proposal. One could have argued for a larger one. 
   Not only did the chairman of our committee put together a piece of legislation that is moderate in size, but he attempts to, in addition, have broad-based tax relief to solve real problems we have in our country--that is, individuals who are struggling to plan for their own retirement, individuals who are trying to send their children to college, individuals who are trying to purchase health insurance, organizations throughout our State that are trying to solicit charitable contributions, and families who are angry because they pay a penalty once they get married. 
   This proposal will not result in our undoing the great progress we have made since the first piece of legislation dealing with the deficit was enacted in 1990, followed with the 1993 effort, and followed by the 1997 effort. 
   This is moderate tax relief. It will be significant for the people of the State of Nebraska. It will not bring back inflation that Mr. Greenspan talked about because of the way the chairman has drawn the bill. 
   I have been asked by people: How can you possibly do this? It is not even a close call for me. It is not even close. 
   I feel extremely enthusiastic about this proposal, about both the dollar size and the makeup of the things that are in it. 
   I think one of the things that would have made this thing very attractive to Senators on this side of the aisle, and I 
   believe many on the Republican side as well, is if we could have found a way to include an increase in the standard deduction--that is in Senator MOYNIHAN's proposal that he will offer later--that would haven taken 3 million people in America completely off the tax rolls. It would take 9 million people that are currently itemizing deductions and put them in a standard deduction category. 
   The proposal would have made it even better from the standpoint of working families. 
   In the small amount of time I have remaining, there are three remaining problems this proposal doesn't even pretend to address and should attempt to address. I have heard people talk about it a lot. 
   No. 1, discretionary spending. This tax cut is not the threat to discretionary spending. 
   We have tremendous discretionary spending problems right now. 
   Everybody knows VA-HUD is in trouble. 
   We have significant cuts to veterans that are not what anybody wants. 
   We have problems in Labor-HHS as well. 
   We know we have problems. There is no tax cut that preceded them. What is causing that is the growing cost of mandatory programs that in the budget we passed in 1997 says that between now and 2009, 56 percent of our budget currently going to mandatory programs will grow to 70 percent. The discretionary programs will go from 31 percent to 27 percent, if we are able to reduce the national debt and reduce the net interest figure as well. 
   That is what is putting pressure on discretionary spending. 
   I know it is difficult to face it because it means we have to make changes in those mandatory programs to reduce their cost, or you have to come to the floor and propose increased taxes to pay for all of the things we want to pay for. 
   There is a problem with growing mandatory and declining discretionary program expenditures. 
   Second, there is a problem with Medicare--not just for the need to modernize the program, not just the need to provide health insurance for prescription benefits, but we should not, with the growing economy--4 percent real growth and 3 percent real growth in quarter after quarter--we should not with growth in the economy see the number of Americans who are uninsured go up. 
   There are an estimated 41 million Americans without health insurance, and 24 million of them are in the workforce. We tax their wages to pay for health insurance for everybody else, but they don't have it. 
   That, in my judgment, is the problem with Medicare. It is not just Medicare. It is all health care that needs to be fixed. 
   Lastly, Social Security. Senator THOMPSON, I, and others intend to offer an amendment at the appropriate time. We know Social Security needs to be fixed. 
   This is not like youth violence or Medicare or lots of issues that are extremely complicated--global climate change and others. This is a very straightforward, simple, actuarial problem. 
   I am astonished that we are able to survive around here without answering the question, What do you think ought to be done? The 150 million Americans under the age of 45 should not 
   like a delay because every year of delay means you have a larger cut in your benefits as a consequence. That is the result of not doing anything. 
   Our proposal will cut payroll taxes by $1 trillion and increase the net worth. It fixes Social Security and increases the net wealth and worth of American households by $1.5 trillion over 10 years. 
   That is the third remaining problem that needs to be addressed. We do not address it by locking the money in a lockbox. That doesn't do anything to extend the solvency of Social Security, and I hope during the progress of this debate we are able to make that clear to the American people. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Lugar Amendment to restore funding to the National Endowment for Democracy. 
   One of the noblest characteristics of the American people is their desire to spread the promise of freedom and democracy throughout the world. In fact, the history of our nation is replete with examples of men and women who have put their own lives on the line in defense of other people's freedom. 
   The 9,386 U.S. soldiers buried at the Normandy American Cemetery in France are more than heroes. They are a testimony to the American willingness to defend democracy. Yet, they are just a few of the literally hundreds of thousands of Americans who have sacrificed their lives to secure democracy both at home and abroad. 
   However, the fight for freedom need not always be waged on the battlefield. Indeed, some of the greatest democratic victories have come, not as a result of our military might, but rather from the power of our ideas. 
   If you doubt this, ask Vaclav Havel how the irresistible pull of democratic values helped liberate the Czech people. Ask Nelson Mandela about how the persuasive power of American democracy helped encourage the struggle for freedom in South Africa's townships. Ask Kim Dae Jung about the decades of American sacrifice and the difference between life in a free South Korea and a totalitarian North Korea. Mr. President, each of these men have come before Congress to say that their freedom is due in no small part to the willingness of the American people to oppose despotism and to support nascent democratic movements in their country. 
   The transformation from totalitarianism to democracy that has swept much of the world in the last decade is nothing short of remarkable. Much of the success of this movement can be attributed to U.S. support for democratic movements, including the on-the-ground programs of the National Endowment for Democracy. This is a legacy of which we should be proud. It's a success story we should do a better job of explaining to the American people. 
   NED was established by Congress in 1983 as a non-profit, bi-partisan organization. It promotes democratic values by encouraging the development of democracy in a manner consistent with U.S. interests, assisting pro-democracy groups abroad, and strengthening electoral processes and democratic institutions. NED accomplishes these goals by providing funding to a wide variety of grantees that operate programs in  more than 80 countries throughout the world. 
   Mr. President, for over 15 years the National Endowment for Democracy has been at the center of our global democracy efforts. Critics have argued it is a relic of the Cold War. They insist NED's usefulness as an organization disappeared with the Soviet Union. This simply is not the case. As long as there are people still struggling to be free, there will be a need to support democratic reforms. The truth is, almost two-fifths of the world's population still live in un-democratic countries. In these countries, people are not given the ability to speak their minds, to practice their religious beliefs, or to unleash the power of their own enterprise. 
   NED grantees are in these countries and are working with pro-democracy groups. In Cuba, NED grantees are helping local dissidents use the world wide web to interconnect and to spread independent news. NED sponsors radio broadcasts into Burma in support of the democracy movement led by Aung San Suu Kyi. And in Iraq, NED provides support for the Free Iraq Foundation to disseminate human rights information from within Saddam Hussein's brutal regime. 
   Beyond extending the power of democracy to those people still toiling under despotic governments, NED is also actively engaged in the effort to solidify democratic progress. Democracy does not exist simply after the first free and fair election--democracy cannot be established solely by the ballot box. Instead, a true democratic society is based on the foundations of the rule of law, respect for the rights of all people, a free press, and civilian control of the military. 
   In countries around the world, NED grantees are involved in helping develop this broader concept of democracy. For example, in Russia NED grantees are supporting efforts to promote the rule of law and to establish legal guarantees for the ownership of land. In Nigeria, they have supported local pro-democracy groups who were instrumental in facilitating this year's historic elections. These are examples of the hundreds of programs NED and its grantees have been involved with in support of democratic reform. 
   Mr. President, I come to the floor today to argue that the fight for democracy is as important to U.S. national security today as it was at the height of the Cold War. It is for this reason that I will vote in favor of the Lugar amendment to restore funding for the National Endowment for Democracy. I recognize the tight discretionary spending limits the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee were forced to work under. I understand very difficult decisions had to be made in preparing the piece of legislation. However, there are few priorities as great, and few programs as cost-effective, as our global democracy efforts. 
   I urge my colleagues to support freedom around the world by supporting the National Endowment for Democracy and the Lugar amendment. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

I think it is a sign that Senators on both sides of the aisle understand that we have an opportunity to do something that is long overdue, but that there is a reason in the past this has not been done; that is to say, restructuring the agency to increase the accountability for the work that is being done on nuclear weapons, both to make certain we preserve sound science at its best and security at its best. 
   I fervently hope we continue in this spirit, because if we do, we will produce a bill with a big vote, and we will be able to conference it, be able to change the law, and enact good reform that will keep the United States of America and our people safe.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I apologize to the Senator from Arizona. I did not hear all the reasons for opposing the Levin amendment because I am afraid, in my own mind, this is getting down to a point where it seems to me--I said to Senator LEVIN earlier that it seems the bill gives the Secretary the right to do all these things. I don't see a lot of reason to oppose this, I really don't. 
   As I understand it, the Senator from Arizona has a problem with the last sentence, which says, ``The director of the agency may establish''--this is a nuclear security agency--``agency-specific policies''--that is the same autonomous objection that we have--``so long as they are fully consistent with departmental policy established by the secretary.'' 
   It seems to me we want the Secretary to be able to establish Department policies that would apply to everybody and allow the new security Agency still to be able to establish specific policies that don't relate to the rest of the Department. I don't understand the Senator's objection to that because it seems to me that is a reasonable thing to say. 
   The trouble I am having--and I am trying to make certain we achieve a big bipartisan vote on this because I don't want to lose the opportunity that we have been given many times in the past couple of decades, and the Senator from Arizona has been pushing hard on this thing. I would hate for us to fail as a consequence of not being able to resolve what seems to me is not that big a conflict. I would appreciate the Senator talking about this last sentence and what he thinks seems to be wrong with it.

   Mr. KERREY. I appreciate that answer. 
   I am struggling. I have been in this position before, I say to my friend from Arizona, where I hear words and they mean something to me and they mean something entirely different to somebody else. I am still struggling. 
   It seems to me that the language of ``the director of the agency may establish agency-specific policies,'' which is what the Senator from Arizona wants, by the way, this amendment amends section 213(a). At the end of the following, ``the secretary shall be responsible''--OK, at the end. It has a paragraph (u) to this. 
   Is that what the Senator from Michigan just took? 
   Is the Senator saying in his amendment that the Secretary shall be responsible for all policies of the Agency? The 
   Senator is saying the Secretary still has that authority. 
   How is that inconsistent? I still don't understand how that undercuts. This one says:  
   The director of the agency may establish agency-specific policies so long as they are fully consistent with the departmental policies established by the Secretary.

   Mr. KERREY. The Senator is saying that if this language says that the Director of the Agency may establish agency-specific policies--the Senator is quite right; I added that. I appreciate very much that change being made. 
   Before I get to the rest of it, let me say that one of the reasons I did that was because of the experience of dealing with agencies or situations in the executive branch where somebody has the responsibility but lacks authority. It is a heck of a problem to be in where you are held accountable for something, but you don't really have the authority to do anything about it in the first place. 
   That is exactly the problem that the Senator is trying to fix with this amendment in the first place--situations where Secretaries have authority and responsibility, but they lack the authority. They lack the ability to actually be able to manage. 
   I appreciate that inclusion. The Senator is saying that if the language said the Director of the Agency may establish agency-specific policies subject to the approval of the Secretary, you have no problem with that?

   Mr. KERREY. Part of the problem I am having with this is it is very clear in the Senator's amendment that the Secretary shall be responsible for all policies of the Agency. That is 
   very clear in the language of the amendment. That is why I am having difficulty understanding how this language undercuts that, or changes that. The Senator wants the Secretary to have the responsibility for the policies of the Agency. What the Senator is trying to do is establish a sufficient amount of independence that this new Agency for nuclear security can develop its own agency-specific policies. It doesn't undercut or eliminate the authority of the Secretary to be able to come in and say: I don't like that. I am not going to allow you to do it. But it is going to occur in an environment where Congress knows it, and the people understand what is going on. 
   It seems to me that is what Senator LEVIN is trying to do, as well.

   Mr. KERREY. We have comparable agencies. 
   I was very much involved with the development of the new law governing the IRS. We wanted that agency also to be semiautonomous. 
   In that case, we created a board with authority to evaluate the budget and make budget recommendations to the Secretary of the Treasury, and that budget has to be forwarded on. If the President wants to change it, he can change it. That budget gets forwarded on to us. 
   In addition, we made a change that the Internal Revenue Commissioner has a 5-year term allowing some continuity. That is one of the problems we had. We had lots of turnover. 
   The same problem existed with the FBI Director a number of years ago. I don't know who was involved in changing that law. We changed some independence of the FBI Director. But in both cases, if the Secretary of the Treasury decides they don't like what the IRS Commissioner is doing, or in Justice's case they don't like what the FBI Director is doing, one of the things we are not talking about is they can always go to the President. The President issues an Executive order; everybody does it. At least they are supposed to do it. Although, again, that is part of the problem that we are trying to address--eliminating a lot of that middle-level management and creating direct lines of authority so Executive orders are carried out. In this case, a Presidential directive was implemented relatively slowly. 
   Perhaps the Senator from Michigan has some suggestions. 
   Does the Senator see a substantial difference between the language in his amendment that says, ``the director of the agency may establish agency-specific policies so long as they are fully  consistent,'' and language that says, ``the director of the agency may establish agency-specific policies understanding,'' and then reference back to section 213(c) that says the Secretary shall be responsible for all policies of the agency? If the Senator can tie it into that line, it seems that is what he is trying to do.

   Mr. KERREY. If the Senator will yield, it seems to me what we ought to try to do is work this thing a little bit longer and see if we can get agreement. 
   I think in the key area with the amendment, we have to reference back this very declarative and clear line the Senator from Arizona referenced, which is 213(C) that says the Secretary shall be responsible for all policies of the Agency. 
   The Senator is shaking his head.

   Mr. KERREY. If I can respond, the Senator from Michigan has a lot of respect on this side of the aisle and I know a lot of respect on that side of the aisle as well, not just because of this particular issue but because of his longstanding interest in the operations of government and his understanding of how statutes need to be written in order to get government to function properly. 
   If the goal is to produce a big bipartisan vote so we can seize this opportunity, as the Senator from Arizona has pressed so relentlessly to get done, it is my hope that there could be a meeting of the minds leading to an agreement of language. 
   If we can get that done, we are one step closer to getting a very large bipartisan vote. That sends a very important signal to the House. That increases the chances to successfully conference this in the Intelligence Committee and bring it back to the full Senate for approval.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I wonder if there is a chance, rather than going to a motion to table, we can work this out. If we can work it out, it increases the chances of getting a big affirmative vote on this bill, which all of us want. 
   The Senator from Michigan sees a flaw in the bill and is concerned about national security and concerned about good science. He has a lot of experience in this. 
   I ask the Senator from Arizona if it is possible we could get the two sides to see if the meeting of the minds we apparently have could lead to an agreement on specific language and acceptance of this amendment, rather than having to get a vote to table or a vote up or down on the amendment with disagreement.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, like Chairman SHELBY, I fully support these two amendments and am enthusiastic as well for the efforts the senior Senator, Mr. MOYNIHAN, has made in the area of secrecy over the years. 
   I made a point earlier, when we were talking about secrecy, that sometimes secrecy does equal security. We have to have secrecy in order to maintain security. But there are times when secrecy actually makes it harder for us to achieve security. It can make us less secure. 
   I retold the story in the Senator's book on the Venona project when Omar Bradley made the decision not to inform the President of the United States about Klaus Fuchs and others. As a consequence of believing the President didn't have a need to know, he kept the secret. I think, as a consequence, there was less security for the Nation. 
   I appreciate and fully agree with the chairman. These amendments are good amendments and should be adopted. I appreciate and applaud and am grateful for the leadership of the Senator from New York on this issue of secrecy.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President I yield such time as is necessary from our side to speak in favor of the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski amendment. 
   I believe this reorganization plan complements the reforms already included in our defense authorization bill as well as the reforms set forth by Secretary Richardson and that they help him achieve his mission. This plan, which is contained in this amendment, will sustain and improve the extraordinary science performed by the nuclear laboratories of the Energy Department while significantly improving security and counterintelligence. 
   Under this reorganization, the Secretary of Energy will set policy and maintain authority over all elements of the new Agency for Nuclear Stewardship. The agency director will then implement his policy and demand that the highest security standards are maintained within the nuclear weapons laboratories. 
   This plan reduces the bureaucracy that both stifles scientific endeavors and hinders security and counterintelligence at our laboratories. The agency will maintain the links between the weapons labs and other labs in parts of the Department of Energy, thereby preserving the capability to cross-fertilize science that is being performed in different programs and in different locations. 
   Numerous reviews that have been performed over the past 25 years by executive branch agencies, the General Accounting Office, the Congress, independent panels, and the Energy Department itself have found security wanting and lax at all of the weapons laboratories. A spate of espionage cases over the last 15 years, cases involving the potential theft of our most potent nuclear weapons designs, shows that counterintelligence at the Energy Department needs serious improvement. In recent hearings, witnesses before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and other committees have described the confused lines of authority, lack of accountability, and both inadvertent and conscious disregard for security concerns. 
   Last month the President's National Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, the PFIAB, led by former Senator Warren Rudman, issued the latest in a long series of reports critical of security and counterintelligence at the weapons laboratories. 
   In its report entitled ``Science At Its Best, Security At Its Worst,'' the PFIAB found that ``organization disarray, managerial neglect and a culture of arrogance both at DOE headquarters and the labs themselves, conspired to create an espionage scandal waiting to happen.'' 
   In response to these problems, the Rudman panel calls for reorganization as necessary ``to resolve the many specific problems with security and counterintelligence in the weapons laboratories but also to address the lack of accountability that has become endemic throughout the entire Department.'' 
   The new structure envisioned in this amendment strengthens the management structure overseeing the nuclear weapons laboratories. By removing the unnecessary involvement of redundant officials in the running of the labs, the new Agency for Nuclear Stewardship sets both clear lines of authority and defined lines of accountability in how the labs are managed. This helps assure that policy directives are properly and expeditiously developed, and that officials can be held accountable for success and failure related to scientific research and security measures. 
   No management structure, however well designed, can be effective if the personnel filling the organization chart are not up to the job. The Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship will be appointed by the President and subject to the advice and consent of the Senate. He or she will be required by statute to have an extensive background in national security, organizational management, and the appropriate technical areas relevant to weapons design work. This individual will be assisted within the Agency by three Deputy Directors for defense programs, nonproliferation and materials disposition, and naval reactors. To promote security throughout the Agency, the Director will be assisted by a Chief of Nuclear Stewardship Counterintelligence, a Chief of Nuclear Stewardship Security, and a Chief of Nuclear Stewardship Intelligence who will work to promote the awareness of and implement measures related to security and counterintelligence. 
   Under this amendment, the Under Secretary will have the necessary authority to effectively manage the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship. This Under Secretary will follow the policies established by the Secretary. The Agency's subordinate security, counterintelligence, and intelligence chiefs will follow policies developed by their corresponding Energy Department offices and approved by the Secretary. 
   The point here is that the Secretary remains accountable, the Secretary retains authority, and as a consequence, the Secretary retains responsibility for the work that is being done. 
   This amendment essentially, under statute, will remove much of the middle-level structure that has built up over the years, which has made it extremely difficult to manage and almost impossible to determine who is responsible. Despite the end of the cold war, our Nation still faces a nuclear threat, and that threat continues to grow. We must not allow the nuclear secrets paid for by the toil and ingenuity of Americans to become tools of those who may wish to harm our Nation. The new Agency for Nuclear Stewardship will help protect those secrets and keep our nuclear arsenal the most advanced and safest among nations. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senator LANDRIEU, Senator BREAUX, Senator LOTT, and others in supporting the Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1999. This important legislation will provide consistent funding to state fish and wildlife conservation programs to help maintain our precious natural resources, and will help to bring more Nebraskans back to the river--in our case, the Missouri River. This legislation will give states the necessary funding to carry out a flexible, non-regulatory approach to conservation that prevents species and their habitats from becoming endangered and to restore fish and wildlife populations to healthy numbers. This legislation is consistent with and fully complementary to the Missouri River Valley Improvement Act of 1999 that I recently introduced, along with my colleagues Senator DASCHLE and Senator JOHNSON. 
   The most important provisions of the Conservation and Reinvestment Act for my home state of Nebraska are Titles II and III, the Land and Water Conservation Fund reform provisions. Title III of this legislation would restore state-side funding to the Land and Water Conservation Fund--funding that has been diverted in recent years for other uses. However, as emphasized by the bill's authors and supporters, restoration of these funds to states is more important now than ever before, as Nebraska and all states are faced with accelerated population growth and urban sprawl, and increased demand by families, communities, and the business sector for recreation and conservation areas--areas that draw people and economic growth. Nebraska, as well as other states, has relied on hunters and anglers to provide the bulk of financial support for fish and wildlife programs--particularly through the purchase of hunting and fishing licenses and through excise taxes on sporting goods. However, these funds have not been adequate to address the needs of declining nongame species. Titles II and III of the Conservation and Reinvestment Act would provide a permanent Federal funding source to meet these needs in Nebraska and other states, and would revitalize the state matching grants program. 
   The Land and Water Conservation Fund Act, as passed in 1965, utilized a portion of the proceeds from Outer Continental Shelf mineral leasing revenues to give to state and local governments for recreation and conservation purposes as those governments deemed necessary and beneficial for their communities. In 1997, a record $5.2 billion in royalties, rents, and bonus payments from new lease sales was collected by the Federal government. Significant federal revenues from Outer Continental Shelf leasing and production has been designated by law for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, but since 1995, Congress has not appropriated these monies to the states, but rather has transferred most of these funds to the U.S. Treasury for other uses. This important legislation would rectify this, and bring the funding source back to Nebraska and to local Nebraska communities. State and local governments match, dollar for dollar, Federal Land and Water Conservation funds for open space conservation and recreation in our communities. This act would restore the state and local funding, bolster the federal funding component, and also secure funding for urban parks and recreational areas. 
   While this act would currently provide 7 percent of Land and Water Conservation Funds to the states, I signed  a letter today, along with several of my colleagues in the Senate, urging that funding for this provision be increased to 10 percent--a level that I believe to be consistent with the needs that exist in my state of Nebraska and in others. Besides providing recreational funding support for community needs, this source of funds can have a significant impact on non-regulatory approaches to preventing wildlife species from being listed as threatened or declined under the Endangered Species Act--listings which often find landowners embroiled in private property rights vs. species protection laws. By enabling communities and states to preserve identified areas where habitat and species can be allowed to flourish with minimal or little disruption on the lives and activities of people, we can help to prevent future listings, and to safeguard against some of the social and economic disruptions that have often accompanied past listings. 
   Additionally, wildlife conservation, conservation education, and wildlife-associated recreational programs--all of which contribute increasingly significant tourism and recreational dollar returns to the state of Nebraska--are traditionally underfunded. The International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies estimates these needs nationally to be approximately one billion dollars per year. 
   Increasing Title III funding to 10 percent of Outer Continental Shelf receipts would give Nebraska approximately an additional $1.7 million annually--money that I know from the people of Nebraska is both needed and would be well-spent. 
   The Nebraska State Legislature passed a resolution this year in support of this bill, as did the City of Grand Island in Nebraska. Nebraska Governor Mike Johanns is one of 27 Governors to officially support this legislation. All 50 state fish and wildlife agencies, including the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, and more than 3,000 local entities, businesses, clubs, and conservation organizations have endorsed the Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1999. Nationwide, more than 200 state and local ballot initiatives sought to commit billions of dollars for conservation, farmland protection, and urban revitalization policies. More than 70 percent of these initiatives were supported by voters. I enthusiastically add my support to this impressive list of supporters, and look forward to working with Senator LANDRIEU and our colleagues to finalize and pass this important legislation.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to the motion to discharge the Finance Committee from further consideration of S.J. Res. 28. I oppose the efforts of the Senator from New Hampshire because I believe passage of S.J. Res. 28 would be a step backward and would jeopardize our efforts to encourage political and economic change in Vietnam. 
   Mr. President, I am confident my colleagues on both sides of this debate share the same goal: helping to create a democratic Vietnam. We all want to see a Vietnam that respects the rights of all of its citizens. A Vietnam whose society is based on the rule of law. A Vietnam that protects private enterprise and abides by international commercial standards. A Vietnam that cooperates with the United States in seeking to end the pain and the lingering questions of the thousands of American POW/MIA families. 
   While we share the same goal, we fundamentally disagree on how best to achieve a democratic Vietnam. Those who support S.J. Res. 28 believe we are more likely to promote democratic reforms and the human rights of the Vietnamese people by discontinuing our dialogue with the Government of Vietnam. They believe we can encourage the transition to free market economics by putting U.S. businesses in Vietnam at a disadvantage relative to their global competitors and making it more difficult for them to operate. Finally, they believe we can improve Vietnamese cooperation in solving outstanding POW/MIA cases by jeopardizing successful, joint investigative and recovery programs. 
   Proponents of this legislation will argue passage of S.J. Res. 28 would only have the minimal effect of denying the President's waiver of the provisions of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. The truth is, this vote is a referendum on our entire policy of engaging Vietnam. Those who support this Resolution have opposed every effort to normalize U.S.-Vietnamese relations. With this Resolution, they are trying to take us back to the policy of the 1980s that sought to isolate Vietnam from the United States both diplomatically and economically. This policy failed in the 1980s, and will undoubtedly fail again. 
   Mr. President, proof of the failure of disengagement is found in the fact that since renewing our diplomatic relations with Vietnam we have seen progress on the issues we care about. I attribute most of this improvement on the ability of our government to communicate with Vietnam through normal, diplomatic channels. This progress will continue if we allow 
   people like Ambassador Pete Peterson to continue to impress upon the Government of Vietnam the seriousness with which we attach to issues such as democratization, human rights, and POW/MIAs. Passage of this Resolution will undermine Ambassador Peterson's efforts, will force us to step back from our policy of engagement, and will endanger the progress we have already achieved. 
   This is not to say that we do not continue to have issues with which we disagree with the Vietnamese government. Economic and social reforms are not progressing quickly enough. We continue to hear of cases where the rights of political dissidents are not respected. And until every POW/MIA is accounted for, we will continue to press the Vietnamese government for answers. However, the authors of S.J. Res. 28--those who oppose continued normalization of our relations with Vietnam--have failed to explain how disengaging from Vietnam will encourage their government to take positive action on any of these issues. 
   Mr. President, those who prefer isolation simply fail to fully understand the power of the United States to act as a catalyst for societal and economic change. We cannot be this catalyst for the Vietnamese people if we are not fully engaged in Vietnam. I would argue we need to be more engaged than we are today. Where we disagree with Vietnamese government, we should forcefully challenge them. And where we see the budding signs of reform, we should foster its growth. We cannot do this if--as those on the other side propose--we do not continue to move forward in our relationship with Vietnam. 
   Passage of S.J. Res. 28 is a step backward. Rather than going back, I believe we should look forward. We should look for ways to fully unleash the power of our people, our ideals, and our system of government to help the Vietnamese achieve the goal of democracy. I urge my colleagues to oppose the motion to discharge S.J. Res. 28. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to join my chairman, Senator SHELBY of Alabama, with whom I have had the pleasure to work now for several years. This is my last year on this select committee. It has been an opportunity, for the last 8 years, to acquire an understanding of what it takes to collect intelligence, to analyze that intelligence, to process it, produce it, and disseminate it. 
   It is nowhere near as easy as it used to be. In the old days, you basically sent human beings out there to try to figure out what was going on. You hoped they spoke the language and were smart enough to figure things out. They would come back and bring you the best stuff they could. Oftentimes it would be too late to act upon it. 
   I had a small piece of that some 30 years ago in the service, where we used to collect intelligence as well. So I have at least some independent understanding of the difficulty, especially on the human side. But the importance of what intelligence can bring to an operation cannot be overstated-- the recent operation in Kosovo, the Dayton peace agreement, incident after incident that cannot be disclosed to the public because most of it occurs in a secret environment where warfighters and policymakers get information in a timely fashion and, as a consequence, lives are saved, success is achieved, and national security is improved. 
   This bill is a result of a bipartisan effort to make the year 2000 a watershed year for intelligence. This bill sets the intelligence community on a course to respond to the very complex world we are facing. The era of downsizing has ended. Intelligence must be positioned to collect, analyze, and inform policymakers on the complex threats we face.  
   As my colleagues are no doubt aware, most of the bill is classified. As always, Chairman SHELBY and I have made the classified sections available to our colleagues for their review. Further, committee staff is readily available to brief on any aspect of this bill. I believe Members have found the bill to be the result of a completely bipartisan effort to fund intelligence activities in fiscal year 2000. 
   Chairman SHELBY and I have tried, and I think on most occasions have consistently applied a single test, to determine whether or not a funding level or a provision or an oversight hearing or a letter or some other action is required. And that test is, will this make the people of the United States of America and our interests more secure as a consequence? If the answer is yes, we have done it. If the answer is no, we have not. 
   We do not, in these committees, check with our leadership to determine whether or not there is a Democratic position or a Republican position. What we do is check to determine whether or not the action will be in the best interest of the United States of America and keep the United States as secure as our best judgments can make it. It has been a pleasure to work with Senator SHELBY, and it has been an honor for me to have the opportunity to watch him participate and to experience his leadership on this committee. 
   As I said, I believe the year 2000 must be a watershed year for intelligence. That is because the intelligence community has been significantly downsized in the decade of the 1990s. Again, in classified briefings, we are pleased to provide Members with the information on that. I think most Members will be shocked to see the budget and the number of people, 
   especially the number of people we have today, who are doing the collection, doing the analysis, doing the work of trying to figure out, with new technologies, how to produce and then how to disseminate this intelligence as quickly and accurately as possible. The number of people doing that has gone down. 
   This is not a simple task, such as we sometimes see in crime reports, where somebody will go into a 7-Eleven store, and they will have a camera that shows who they are. It is not that simple. These are, on the imaging side, complicated images; on the signal side, complicated signals; and always, on the human side, a very complicated set of circumstances out there that have to be first observed and then interpreted by men and women who have the requisite skills to get the job done. 
   Furthermore, we are making decisions today that don't just affect this year. We are making decisions today that will affect intelligence collectors and intelligence efforts 10 years from now. 
   In the area of technology, one has to try to anticipate where the world is going to go. The chairman and I put together what is called a technical advisory group, a group of not only highly skilled but highly motivated men and women, who love their country and are concerned about what we need to do to keep our country safe. We were able to basically take very complicated subjects; in my case--I am sure it is not true for the chairman --they had to convert sophisticated subject matter into very unsophisticated phrases so I would be able to understand what it was they were saying and make better judgments as well about what we need to do. Their contributions have been enormously important and have added significant value to our ability to make these kinds of decisions. 
   I pay them a very high compliment and urge my colleagues to consider that it is not just the highly professional and skilled staff--a couple years ago, we went away from a system where Republicans got so many staff members, Democrats got so many staff members or an individual got staff as well, to a professional staff--we have enjoyed the benefit of tremendous input coming from our private sector technical advisory group. 
   The cold war has ended. 
   And it is quite appropriate for us to have downsized our intelligence collection. As I said, in my strong and considered judgment, we have reached the point of no return. We have reached the point now where we are beginning to drawdown, as we say in farm country, our seed corn. We are drawing down our basic stockpile of resources to the point where we are doing great damage to our ability to answer the call of warfighters. 
   Though nobody knew the direction the world was going to take, or the size and seriousness of the threats the United States was going to face after the cold war, during the transition I believe it was quite correct to restructure many national priorities and get our economy back on sound footing. However, this transition must be considered to be open especially now that we have a better understanding of where the rest of the world is heading and we have a much more precise understanding of the kinds of threats the people of the United States face in that world. 
   Unfortunately, in some areas in the world, the world is heading in the wrong direction. Rogue states are trying to acquire chemical, nuclear, and biological weapons for the purpose of threatening us and our friends. Many countries are actively pursuing long-range missile programs, which also threaten international peace. 
   A potential strategic partner, Russia, is in the midst of economic chaos and under extreme political difficulties. In recent war game exercises involving 50,000 conventional forces in Russia, the defense minister said those conventional forces did not have the capability they had 7 or 8 years ago when it was the Soviet Union. They have now made a decision to use nuclear weapons much more quickly than under previous battlefield instructions. That increases the threat to the people of the United States and signals the kind of decisionmaking that other powers out there that do not have conventional parity with the United States and other powers with bad intent might do in order to compensate for their lack of conventional strength. 
   Even more problematic, Russia's nuclear stockpile is aging. It is subject to the vagaries of the political and economic problems that confront its national leaders and too large to serve its essential defense requirements. Moreover, other nations are either at war or on the brink of war. 
   Prior to the Fourth of July recess, I spoke on the floor about the escalating military confrontation building between India and Pakistan. That conflict appears to have been resolved and a stand-down has occurred, but that conflict could flash up in an instant and put the interests of the people of the United States at considerable risk. Elsewhere, in Kosovo and Bosnia, and with Serbia, as well, our relations are extremely unsettled and are the focus of very close attention. 
   The list goes on and on. We have 37,000 Americans forward deployed in South Korea. Americans are forward deployed in many other regions in this world for the purpose of stabilizing those parts of the world. We believe--and I think quite correctly--that forward deployment increases stability in the world and adds to the chances of success to the struggling democratic nations--struggling to make the transition from command economies to market. It is very important for the United States to deploy our forces. It tends to act as a deterrent against potential bad actors. We have a mission in Iraq we are flying on a daily basis, and we are trying to watch 
   literally the entire planet simultaneously so as to prepare our policymakers for something that could happen which could put American lives and interests at risk. 
   I am not trying to turn this statement into an international tour de force over foreign or defense policy. Instead, I want to remind my colleagues and the citizens whom they represent, that in many regions the world order is very disordered, and the Intelligence Community is the edge our policymakers must have in order to stay ahead of what has happened. 
   Without timely intelligence support, we cannot respond effectively. This means the era of downsizing intelligence has to end or we will find ourselves at a point where Congress discovers there are things we can't do. There is a tendency to take our intelligence efforts for granted and see it as sort of an invisible force. We see an image that is presented to us, such as a bomb damage assessment, and we don't understand what went into that. We didn't merely pull it off of a shelf. Or we see a report of an analysis that  is done, where decisions are made and troops are deployed, and we don't ask ourselves as often as we should what was the intelligence collection fraction that went into that effort. 
   Was it possible to just pick up the forces and go into an area? The answer is no. A significant amount of analysis is done, and that analysis has given us an edge. It gives us battlefield superiority and the capability of doing things that, in previous wars, we were simply unable to do. 
   Our enemies know that. Our intelligence capability, all by itself, acts as a considerable deterrent. Because people know we have the capabilities, they are much less likely to take an action that would be hostile to us, dangerous to us and at the end of the day dangerous for them as well. 
   As colleagues may recall, last year when introducing the Fiscal Year 1999 Intelligence Authorization Act, I referred, as I mentioned, to this technical advisory group that Chairman SHELBY had the foresight to create. This highly qualified group of Americans evaluated some of the most esoteric and technical subjects the committee had to confront in order to position intelligence for future challenges. We used their services this year. They provided us with extremely valuable advice and saved taxpayers, my guess is--it would not be out of line to say they have saved hundreds of millions of dollars. 
   They have identified the areas where we might be able to use technology to reduce the threat of weapons of mass destruction. Because of the enormous contributions these men and women on the technical advisory group have made to the intelligence oversight effort, we had the ability not to just write a bill but, as I have said, write a bill that will keep Americans more safe. 
   I would be remiss if I didn't mention a subject that held a lot of media attention over the past 3 or 4 months, and that is counterintelligence. This bill contains provisions intended to help intelligence and law enforcement meet the espionage challenges we face. I am sure it is obvious that because of who we are, many nations want to know what we do. Espionage is a fact of life. We should act decisively when we detect it and prosecute fully those who engage in it. But it will not go away. Thus, we need to strengthen counterintelligence to meet the challenges. The bill contains important provisions to help 
   us attack this very real and present danger. 
   As my colleagues are no doubt also aware, there will be an important amendment on the bill concerning a reorganization of parts of the Department of Energy. Most of the amendment is not about intelligence or counterintelligence; it is about nuclear weapons security. The President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board's report entitled ``Science At Its Best, Security At Its Worst'' reminds us it is also about accountability. 
   I look forward to a full debate on the amendment of which I am a cosponsor and to our discussion on the intelligence and counterintelligence provisions. 
   Again, I thank Senator SHELBY, the chairman of the committee, for his bipartisan and patriotic approach to developing this bill. I thank the entire staff for their work to present the committee a bill they could fully support. Because of the spirit of working together, the bill was reported out of committee unanimously. I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona. He is persistent with this legislation. I appreciate very much his interest in the beginning in trying to do something about, as he knows, what many people have previously said needs to be done. 
   The distinguished Senator from Virginia finally succeeded in getting a provision accepted by the administration in the national defense authorization bill having to do with an oversight committee appointed by the leadership, which I think will add a lot of value to our effort to make these labs produce 
   good science and the best security as well. 
   I was asked the question, I say to my friend from Arizona, not long after our caucuses, which the Senator from Arizona might be interested in: Do you think the Republicans want an issue or do they want to get something done? 
   My view is, Senator KYL of Arizona, Senator MURKOWSKI of Alaska, and Senator DOMENICI of New Mexico want to get something done. It has been probably 20 years people have been calling to our attention the need to change the structure of this organization. It is basically a hodgepodge of various agencies that were combined in, I believe, 1978 or 1979--in the 1970's. Various agencies were combined into the Department of Energy. It is very important we seize this opportunity. 
   Senator Rudman said he did not know what happened exactly, but all of a sudden the focus is on it. A series of things have occurred that present us with an opportunity to change this law. The law needs to be changed. The law needs to be changed to restructure this agency to make it more likely that the United States of America and our interests are going to be safe and secure, and that we will continue to produce the high-quality science these laboratories are known throughout the world for producing. 
   I have very high praise for the Senator from Arizona. I appreciate very much his perseverance in this matter and his willingness to change his own bill to accommodate former Senator Rudman, the PFIAB's recommendations, and accommodate some of the concerns I had as well. 
   We are trying to write a law. I know Senator LEVIN and Senator BINGAMAN, Senator REID, and others, are going to offer some amendments. I say to my colleagues on the Democratic side, I believe, and I believe so strongly, that the Republicans do not desire an issue. They want to make real change. 
   It would have been real easy, in fact, to say: OK, we got 10 or 11 things on the defense authorization bill. You can say that is a success; why fight that battle. We have encryption to do. We have lots of other issues--all of us do--to take care of. 
   I am very impressed with the fact there is a determination to get a good piece of legislation that will improve the security of the United States of America and will enable us to stay in the high-quality science direction these laboratories produce. I hope the debate, which I am not sure is going to occur tonight--I understand we may not have any amendments offered to this bill until tomorrow. I hope I am wrong. It will be nice to have people  offer these amendments and get them out of the way so we can move on to other business. 
   I hope the debate is engaged in the same high-level manner that we have negotiated the changes in this legislation. By high level, I mean, as I referenced earlier in praise of Chairman SHELBY, the only test that is important is: Does it make the United States of America more secure? 
   I believe the amendment of the Senator from Arizona does. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of it. I intend to vote for it, and I hope some of the changes being suggested can be accommodated, but most important, I hope we end this year changing the law and are able to look into the future 10 years from now and say the laboratories are producing the finest science and the highest level of security as well.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico has done a very good job of outlining an urgent need to change our law governing the Department of Energy. I have high praise for him and Senators WARNER, MURKOWSKI, KYL, and, on our side, Senators LEVIN, BINGAMAN, and LIEBERMAN, who have worked to try to fashion a piece of legislation, a law that will balance our need for secrecy and our need for security. 
   I appreciate very much, I say to the Senator, his leadership on this and the sense of urgency that he has brought to the need to change our law. My hope is that we, at the end of the day, at the end of this debate--I do not think there is going to be very much objection to moving to this bill--my hope is that we can get a very large majority, if not a unanimous vote in support. 
   I know the Senator from Michigan, Mr. LEVIN, has some amendments he wants to offer. He has talked to me a little bit about them. We will have a chance to talk about those, I guess, tomorrow when we come to it. 
   But there is no question that the laboratories have been a tremendous source of pride and a tremendous source of discovery and a tremendous success story as far as delivering to the United States of America things that have made the United States of America more secure and more prosperous. 
   Likewise, there is no question that over the years--over the last 20 years or so--since the Department of Energy was created, there has been sort of a gradual buildup of layers of bureaucracy that make it more and more difficult for any Secretary of Energy, whether that individual has the requisite skills or not, to know what is going on in the laboratories and to have the authority needed to manage those agencies so those laboratories, as Senator Rudman, chairman of the PFIAB says in the title of his report, can get both the best science and the best security simultaneously. We unquestionably have the best science. I am quite certain the Senator from New Mexico believes the same way I do. In visiting the labs, in particular the lab that is under question, Los Alamos, most of the people I have met there described themselves as being very conservative to extremely conservative on the question of security and expressed their concern that their reputation for keeping the United States of America safe has been damaged. Of all the people who are anxious to get the law changed so that the lab's reputation for being the world's finest both for science and security can be restored, there are no more powerful advocates of that than at Los Alamos Laboratory from Dr. Brown on down. 
   This is an unusual opportunity because normally the intelligence authorization bill goes through almost with unanimous consent. Since I have had the opportunity a few years to come here with the chairman, with usually about 15 minutes' worth of conversation and without a lot of interest, the bill goes through. The good news this year is that it will not go through quite so quickly. It is good news because it gives us an opportunity to examine what it is this bill does and what it is this bill does not do. 
   Unfortunately, current law does not allow us to tell the people of the United States of America either how much we spend on all of our intelligence collection, analysis, or dissemination efforts, or does it allow us to tell what the individual components of that are. I say ``unfortunately'' because I do believe quite strongly that we would be better off changing the law so the public did know both of those things. I believe that unless the people of the United States of America support what it is we are doing with our intelligence efforts, 
   it is very difficult, over a long period of time, to sustain that effort. I myself am very much concerned that at the moment the general public does not either understand what it is we do on the intelligence side, or as a consequence of some very highly publicized failures are they terribly confident that we are doing a very good job of collecting intelligence, analyzing that intelligence, producing that intelligence, and then disseminating that intelligence to either warfighters or to national policymakers. 
   I have had the good fortune of watching the men and women who do this work for a number of years. I am not only impressed with their skills, but I am impressed with their patriotism and impressed with their successes, most of which I cannot talk about on the floor this afternoon. 
   Let me make the case, first of all, for secrecy. I think there are times when it is absolutely vital and needed. When we have warfighters on the field, as we recently had in Kosovo, we obviously can't provide the target list to the public and let people know where it is that these pilots are going to be flying. We cannot obviously provide battlefield information. Otherwise, we are going to increase the risk to these warfighters. It is always difficult in an environment where it is just the United States, let alone where there are 18 allies, to contain that intelligence and not have a terrible example of something where intelligence information got to our enemies, and as a consequence, they were better prepared, and as a consequence either we were not as successful as we wanted to be or there were casualties as a consequence.  
   It is a life-or-death matter that we keep these secrets. We have asked men and women to put their lives at risk, and we have to protect their interests. Otherwise, we will find it very difficult to find volunteers to go on these missions. 
   It is needed for military operations. It is needed for some covert operations as well, where the President has signed a finding. He has asked that certain things be done, again, in the interest of the United States, overseen by the Congress. Today, I have very high praise for this administration in that regard. Since the Aldrich Ames spy incident where Aldrich Ames, traitor to his country, not only gave up U.S. secrets, he gave up secrets that led to the deaths of many men and women who were working on our behalf, this administration has increasingly come to the oversight committees, one in the House and one in the Senate that were created in 1976, with what are called notifications of errors, notifications of problems and mistakes that were made on a weekly basis. 
   We are receiving information that the executive branch thinks we need to know in order for us to make judgments about what it is we think the United States of America ought to be doing. So there is a lot more--in fact, it feels like a fire hose at times--notifications that are occurring in both the House and the Senate committee. 
   Indeed, our committee was notified about this particular incident in 1996, and I think we responded appropriately to it at the time. We pushed back and asked for additional counterintelligence. When I say ``this particular incident,'' I am talking about the notification of the possibility that the Chinese had acquired what we now know in published accounts to be details about a weapons system known as the W-88, our most sophisticated nuclear weapon, that the Chinese had acquired that 
   through espionage in the 1980s. 
   We were notified of that in 1996, 11 years after it was suspected to have happened. I think the committees were properly notified, and I think the committees properly responded and measured the relative threat to other things in the world and pushed back and responded, I thought, in an appropriate fashion. There was much more that we probably could have done. I will let history judge whether or not we did enough. The point is, there are secrets. As a consequence of those secrets, under law, under a resolution we have created, the Senate Committee on Intelligence and the House has done the same. Those committees have congressional responsibility for hearing these secrets and making judgments, first, about what kind of structure, what kind of budget, and what kind of operations we are going to approve. 
   I make the case that secrecy is needed in order to maintain our security both for military and for our operations. There are sources that we use, there are methods we use, both of which must be kept secret in order for us to continue to recruit and in order for us to continue to operate with a maximum amount of safety for, again, the men and women who have chosen, as a result of their patriotic love of their country, to serve their country in these missions. We need to make certain we provide them with the secrecy needed for them to conduct their operations. 
   However, there are times when secrecy does not equal security. It is a very important point for us to consider as we both debate this bill and try to think about how we want to write our laws and think about how we are going to do our operation. Sometimes secrecy can make security more difficult. 
   There is a recently declassified report called the Venona Report that describes the acquisition of information about spies inside the United States during the post-World War II era. In that report, there is a very interesting moment when General Omar Bradley, who at that time was in charge of intelligence, made the decision not to inform the President of the United States that Klaus Fuchs and others were spies for the Soviet Union. The President was not informed. Secrecy was maintained. General Bradley liked President Truman; he was an Army man like himself. But he made a judgment that secrecy had to be maintained, that the commanding officer of all our forces, that the President, duly elected by the people, didn't have a need to know. So a judgment was made to preserve secrecy. 
   I believe, as a consequence, policies didn't turn out to be as good as they should have and security was compromised as a consequence. I am not blaming General Bradley. I see it from time to time. Indeed, what caused me to talk about this was my belief that we should change the law and allow the people of the United States of America to know how much of their money we are allocating for intelligence and how much in the various categories is being allocated. I fear that all the public has are bad stories about mistakes that are being made, the most recent one being a mistake in targeting inside of Belgrade. 
   The Chinese Embassy was mistakenly hit one block away from another target that should have been hit. A great deal of examination of that has already been done. It caused us a great deal of trouble with the Chinese Ambassador. Under Secretary of State Pickering had to make a trip to China. This all occurred at a very delicate time when we were trying to get the Chinese to agree to some changes in their policy to ascend to the WTO. 
   It was a big embarrassment. 
   I get asked about it all the time: What kind of so-and-so's are over there? Are we getting our money's worth? Are we wasting our money? Couldn't they just have spent $2 on a map that was readily available to show where the Chinese Embassy was? Why spend billions of dollars on all these folks if they don't even have good enough sense to use a commercially made $2 map? 
   There are questions about the failure to predict the detonation of a nuclear weapon in India over a year ago, which was followed by a detonation by Pakistan. A third item I hear a lot is that the CIA failed to predict the end of the Soviet Union, and anybody that can't predict that doesn't deserve to get a lot of U.S. tax dollars. 
   It is unfortunate that only the bad stories get out. First of all, on the targeting of the embassy, it was a mistake, but we were in a war, for gosh sakes. We are being asked to deliver targets, asked to identify the targets, and the operation's requirement was to minimize the casualties to the United States and our allies. Not a single American or single ally was killed during that entire operation. I consider that a mark of tremendous success. That did not occur by accident. There is no shelf of books with one saying ``T'' for targets in Belgrade and Kosovo. We had to develop those targets on our own and relatively late. We didn't expect the bombing operation to go on that long. We had--when I say ``we,'' I mean the administration--the impression that possibly it would be over quicker, based upon the experience of 1995. 
   In short, it was a tremendous success. Not only were we able to conduct that operation without a single allied casualty, but, in addition, we reversed the trend of modern warfare in the 20th century. Modern warfare in the 20th century has seen an increasing fraction of casualties that are noncombatants. I believe, in this case, except for the casualties produced by the Serbian army and their military police and their paramilitary units in Kosovo, there was also success in minimizing civilian casualties in this effort. 
   We could not, for example, have implemented Dayton. One of the untold stories is the success of the intelligence operations. At that time, it was General Hughes who organized the takeover authority in December of 1995. It was a United Nations operation, transferred over to NATO. They worked night and day to set up a communications system that allowed us to know who was and who wasn't abiding by the Dayton agreement--a very, very complicated agreement. The people who were in charge of developing our intelligence operation read it, knew it, and disseminated it down the ranks. Everybody understood what had to be done. It was impressive that, in a very small amount of time, we were able to put together an intelligence collection and dissemination effort that enabled us to implement the Dayton agreement. 
   There are many other examples, such as the Indian detonation of a nuclear weapon. In fact, we had the intelligence collection that predicted and prevented one about 18 months earlier.  Nobody should have been surprised. We don't really need to have intelligence officers collecting and predicting a detonation of nuclear weapons in India when the successful party in an election promised, and made a part of their campaign a promise, to detonate if they were elected, to test a nuclear weapon. 
   Anyway, I think it is very important for me, as somebody 
   who has been given by my leader the opportunity to sit on this committee and to observe what is going on, to attempt to correct things I thought were wrong, make decisions about how much taxpayer money to allocate, about how to respond to mistakes made and intelligence errors that occur, how to respond and correct those errors--it is very important for me to say to taxpayers that my view is that you are getting your money's worth. 
   According to published accounts, we spend $28 billion a year. I wish I could provide that number as well as some additional details, but if that is the current dollar amount, according to published accounts, in my view, just watching what is done, the American people are getting their money's worth. There are tremendous threats in the world that our intelligence agencies collect against. They supply that intelligence to our warfighters, to our military people. Imagine what it would be like to be in charge of U.S. forces in South Korea. You have the most heavily militarized area in the world between North and South Korea. There are about 37,000 young men and women in South Korea defending against a possible attack from North Korea, and the question to their commanding officer is: What are North Korea's intentions? What are they doing? They need an answer. 
   It is an extremely hard target to penetrate and to know what is going on. Those warfighters need to know that information. They can't operate in the dark. Our intelligence collection operators do that time in and time out, day in and day out, try to collect, process, produce, and disseminate intelligence to warfighters and the national policymakers and decisionmakers, in order that the United States of America can be as safe as it possibly can be. My view is that they have achieved a substantial success. They are not perfect; none of us are. But their substantial success deserves a very high amount of praise. 
   Mr. President, a related problem we have with intelligence is that many people presume that the Director of Central Intelligence, who manages the CIA and other national intelligence efforts, controls it all. Not true, though the Brown commission report that was assembled after the Aldrich Ames betrayal recommended that increased authority be given to the Director of Central Intelligence to budget and select personnel for these other areas. For many reasons, these authorities were not granted the Director. The current Director, Mr. Tenet, controls far less than they realize, under law. 
   I don't believe that is a healthy situation. We were successful 2 years ago in getting the Director, under statute, some additional authorities. But my view is that it is not enough to match authority with responsibility. We have not done that. We are holding the Director responsible for intelligence failures in many areas over which he has no real direct budget authority or personnel authority. 
   So the distinguished Senator from New Mexico has properly identified a problem at the laboratories, as a result of the structure of the law that governs the Department of Energy, that needs to be fixed. The concern is that through some set of facts--today, we don't even know what the set of facts are--the Chinese probably acquired information about our nuclear secrets, and, as a consequence, they may have the capacity to build and deploy very dangerous weapons. They stole secrets 
   from us, and, as a consequence, we are concerned about how to increase the secrecy of these labs. 
   I underscore with this statement that secrecy does not in all cases equal security. There are times when secrecy will make security more difficult to achieve. My own view is that the failure under law to let the public know what our expenditures are, and how those moneys are spent, decreases our security because, unless I am mistaken in just sensing citizens' attitudes toward our intelligence agencies, they do not have a sufficient amount of confidence that they are getting their money's worth. As a consequence of that lack of confidence, I think we are having a difficult time acquiring the resources necessary in a world that is more complicated and a world that, in many ways, is more dangerous than it was prior to the end of the cold war. 
   My hope is that this debate about the Department of Energy can occur relatively quickly, that we can get to it tomorrow, that we can resolve the remaining conflicts, and that we can get this intelligence authorization bill passed. Both the chairman and I see the year 2000 as a watershed year. We were successful last year in increasing the resources given to our intelligence checks and analysis and production and dissemination efforts. We need to continue that trend. 
   We have been downsizing in the 1990s. I believe very strongly that that downsizing must stop if we are going to be able to honestly say yes to the American people, that we are doing all we can to keep them as safe as possible against a real range of threats which are still out there in the world. 
   The United States of America is the leading nation on this planet. We have the strongest economy. We have the strongest military. We have the longest running democracy. We tend to take sides on issues, whether it is in the Middle East, Northern Ireland, or someplace else on the planet. We clearly take sides when it comes to fighting for individual freedom--for the freedom of people in China, for the freedom of people in Russia, and throughout this planet. We put our resources and our reputation and our lives on the line. 
   In 1996--it has been so long ago--Americans stationed in Saudi Arabia after the gulf war, flying missions and supporting missions in the southern area, were killed. We suspect a variety of possibilities as perpetrators. But they were killed not because they were in Saudi Arabia by accident; they were in Saudi Arabia defending U.S. interests, and they were killed because they were targeted by people who didn't want them in Saudi Arabia. 
   We take sides, and, as a consequence, we are targets. We are targets as well because we have been successful. There is jealousy and hatred towards the people of the United States of America. 
   We understand the interconnected nature of our economy and of our diplomacy throughout the world. A problem in Angola can be a problem in Omaha, NE relatively quickly. 
   So we forward-deploy our resources. We don't just have missions in NATO or missions that involve the United Nations. We are forward-deployed throughout the world in an attempt to make the world more peaceful, more democratic, and more prosperous. It is a mission the United States of America has selected for itself. I thank God that it has. It is a mission that has resulted in enormous success. 
   I don't know how the rest of my colleagues felt at the time, but I remember quite vividly and was very moved for moments during Joint Sessions of Congress--not that Presidents haven't moved me with their State of the Union Addresses. But far more moving to me was Vaclav Havel, Nelson Mandela, Lech Walesa, and Kim Dae-jung of South Korea. 
   All four of these men came to a Joint Session of Congress and said to the representatives of the people of this country: Thank you; you have put your lives on the line for our freedom; you put your money on the line for our freedom; you stayed the course, and we are free. 
   Since Kim Dae-jung of South Korea gave that address, if I ever ran into a man who fought in the ``forgotten war'' in South Korea in the 1950s, I am quick to say this. I know there are many criticisms of that war. Many people wondered whether or not it was worthwhile. Let me tell you, on behalf of the President of South Korea and the people of South Korea, that that war was worth fighting. 
   All one has to do is look at the difference between living in freedom in South Korea--an imperfect democracy, as many are; but, nonetheless, the people of South Korea are free; their standard of living is higher; they have the liberty to practice their religion, to speak on the streets--and North Korea, which is a nation of great suffering and great anguish. Large numbers of people  are dying as a consequence of malnutrition. The country is arguably in the worst condition of any country on the face of this Earth. 
   That didn't occur by accident. The world marketplace didn't get that done. I am a big fan of the marketplace and a big fan of what business can do. The intervention that liberated the people of South Korea was not the intervention of Sears & Roebuck; it was the intervention of American forces, American will, American blood, and American money. The people of South Korea are free as a consequence. 
   We didn't make a decision based on the shape of their eyes or based on the color of their skin or based upon their religion. We didn't do it based upon a desire to own territory or a desire to own wealth or a desire to establish a colony. We did it based upon a desire to fight and to keep the people of South Korea free. 
   When you take a stand such as that, as the distinguished occupant of the Chair knows--he has been in politics a very long time, an outstanding public servant--you know when you take a stand, especially on a controversial subject, you are apt to provoke some enemies; you are apt to get people organized against you. They don't agree with the position on this, that, or the other thing. 
   The United States has enemies as a result of taking a stand and as a result of our having taken a stand throughout the world in general on behalf of freedom. 
   We provoke animosity in many ways. We are at risk, as a consequence, not just from nation states--that is the older world where nation states were the No. 1 threat--today, it is nonnation state actors such as Osama bin Laden and other terrorists who organize themselves away from the normal powers and structures of government. Cyber warfare, biological and chemical warfare--all of these things we have discussed at length are real and present dangers to the people of the United States of America. 
   It is certainly true that our diplomats at the State Department and our diplomats in other areas of Government have to try to use our intelligence and produce diplomatic successes, as well as to reduce threats. But the State Department, the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, the Department of Agriculture--throughout Government--the Congress, and the President of the United States regularly receive analysis that has occurred after checks have been done, after analysis has been done, after production has occurred, and then it is disseminated to people who make decisions all the time and, hopefully, make better decisions as a consequence of the intelligence delivered to them. 
   My view is that this budget decline we have experienced in the 1990s needs to stop. I hope that this intelligence authorization bill will be passed by the Senate, that we can go to conference quickly with the House, and get it to the President for his signature. I have no doubt that the President, subject to our not putting things on here that the President can't support, will sign the bill. 
   One of the things that I think undercuts our ability to do that is the continued belief we have to keep from the American people how much money is being spent. I have said that often enough now. I am not going to offer an amendment. I can count votes. I know that amendment would not succeed. But I intend to continue to make the point and try to persuade, especially my friends on the other side of the aisle, that we will increase the Nation's security by making this information publicly available to the American people. 
   Again, the point here is that 100 percent secrecy does not always equal 100 percent security. Sometimes 100 percent secrecy can actually decrease the security, as a consequence of the right people not getting the information. As a consequence of discussions not proceeding subject to compartmentalization that prevented one key person from talking to another key person, and, as a consequence, neither one of them knew what the other was doing, the result is that a bad decision was made. 
   I also would like to discuss an issue that, to me, is extremely important. I don't know if the Senator from New Mexico has additional things he wants to say. 
   Does the Senator from Michigan desire to speak? Since I will be assigned to sit down for a long period of time, Senators may want to move on. I think I will have plenty of time to talk about this bill. 
   Mr. President, I presume they would like to speak. I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. Madam President, this bill doesn't normally get a lot of attention, but because of the concern over the loss of secrets through our laboratories at the DOE, we are going to have a debate about an amendment to restructure the Department of Energy. 
   I want to make a point that I made earlier, which is that secrecy and security are not the same thing. Sometimes secrecy equals security. Sometimes secrecy can make security more difficult, harder for us to accomplish the mission  of keeping the United States of America as secure as we possibly can. 
   I am not going to offer an amendment to this bill, because it has been defeated pretty soundly in the past--although I must say I am tempted to do so--to disclose to the American people how much is spent on intelligence gathering. Right now, under law, we cannot do that. I want to call my colleagues' attention to what is happening. Our first vote is on cloture. I think cloture will be invoked pretty easily. Our leader is not going to hold anybody up from voting for cloture. Maybe we can go right to the bill. 
   Listening to Senators DOMENICI and LEVIN earlier, I think they may be able to solve their differences. The vote may end up being unanimous, which is my wish. I hope we can continue to move closer together on that piece of legislation, an important piece of legislation on which Senator DOMENICI and others have been working. 
   I want to call my colleagues' attention to what we do every year basically, and that is, the authorization of appropriations for the intelligence bill is very small, as a consequence of not being able to disclose to the American people what is in the bill. The House bill contains six titles. The Senate bill, which will be offered as a substitute for the House bill, also contains six titles. The first two titles are identical. Titles I and II in the House bills are identical. Then there are general provisions, and then each bill has additional things in there. 
   But you can see the problem we have getting public support for intelligence collection. That is one step in the process of intelligence. We collect with imaging efforts, we collect with signals intercepts, we collect with human intelligence, and we have measurement intelligence. We have all sorts of various what are called INTs that are used to gather raw data. 
   Then somebody has to take that data and analyze it. What does it mean? What does this data mean? What is the interpretation of it? Oftentimes secrecy can be a problem because one compartment may not be talking to another. 
   This administration and others have worked to try to bring various people together so there is more consultation than there has been in the past. But oftentimes decisions have to be made very quickly. Sometimes interpretations of public information are made, and an adjustment is made. 
   Let me be very specific. About 80 percent, in my view, of the decisions that most elected people make in Congress having to do with national security are made as a result of something they acquired in a nonclassified fashion in a TV report, in a radio report, in a newspaper report, or a published document. Staff analyze it and come and say: This is what we think is going on--about 80 percent of the information that we process. 
   I would say that would probably be on the low side. It may be even higher than that. Indeed, the President may be in a similar situation. He may be making a decision on a very high percentage of publicly accessible information as opposed to classified information. 
   That is quite the trend. The trend is both healthy and at times disturbing because more and more information is being made available to the public that was not available in the past. The good news is citizens have more information. They process that information. We have a lot of independent analysts out there. 
   In a couple of years, when metering satellite photographs are available, we are going to see competing analyses being done over images. This is what I see when I take that photograph. 
   I say this because I think it is true that it is very difficult, for any length of time for the Congress and the President to do something the public doesn't support, especially when it comes to spending their money. 
   In this case, I just hazard a guess. I never polled on this. But certainly I take a lot of anecdotal stories on board from citizens who question whether or not they are getting their money's worth. Is all the money we are spending worthwhile when we aren't able to tell where the Chinese Embassy is in Belgrade? A $2 map would have told us where it was. When we were unable to forecast a class of facility, when we were unable to foresee that India was going to test a nuclear weapon following an election, during which the party that was successful campaigned, and their platform said, if we are elected and we come to power, we are going to test a nuclear weapon? Many failures, in short, are out in the public, and the public acquires the information. I think it has caused them to lose confidence that they are getting their money's worth. 
   It is a real crisis for us. It is a real challenge for us because, again, if you look at the document we will be voting on sometime in the next couple of days--usually this thing goes through very quickly and we don't have much time to consider it. In an odd way, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for bringing so much attention to the Department of Energy's need for restructuring because it has given us some time to pause and look at this piece of legislation. 
   As I said, the two most important titles, the ones you will see in almost every intelligence authorization bill, is title I and title II. Title I has five sections. It authorizes appropriations. It give us classified schedule authorization, personnel ceiling adjustment authorization, community management account authorization, and emergency supplemental appropriations. That is in the House bill. The Senate bill has four titles. It is quite revealing when you go into title I. 
   Again, normally, if this is a Department of Defense authorization, each one of these titles would provide the detailed and specific number of how much is being spent, all the way down to the very small individual accounts that would be disclosed to the public. There would be a great debate going on. The committee report comes out. The budget comes out. The bill is reported by the Armed Services Committee. Editorials are written. Journalists and specialists say we are spending too little; we are spending too much; we need to build this weapons system, and so forth. A great public debate then ensues when the committee brings the bill up and reports it out for full consideration by the Senate. 
   I think that debate is healthy. The public participates and helps us decide what it is we ought not be doing. Sometimes we still put things in we shouldn't and some things we should. We still make mistakes. That public debate helps us. 
   Under this authorization, what you see in section 101 is the following: The funds are hereby authorized to be appropriated for fiscal year 2000 for the conduct of intelligence and intelligence-related activities of the following elements of the U.S. Government: the CIA, the Department of Defense, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, the Department of Air Force, the Department of State, the Department of Treasury, the Department 
   of Energy, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the National Conference Office, and the National Imagery and Mapping Agency--11 different Government agencies are named but no dollar figure is included. The only dollar figure in this entire budget comes in section 104 where the public learns we are authorizing $171 million to be appropriated for the Community Management Act of the Director of Central Intelligence. We have that piece of information. 
   Later in the bill that we will be voting on, we learn $27 million is available for the National Drug Intelligence Center. Then later, a third time we get another number. We learn $209.1 million is authorized to be appropriated to the Central Intelligence Agency's retirement and disability fund for fiscal year 2000. 
   That is all the public learns. That is all the public knows. The public does not know how much we spend in each one of these agencies, nor how much the committee is recommending in this authorization bill, nor the total amount of dollars being spent. 
   We have had debates about this before. There are good arguments usually filed against it: This is going to deteriorate our national security; we need to maintain, in short, a secret in order to preserve national security. 
   I have reached the opposite conclusion, that this is a situation where the preservation of a secret deteriorates our national security as a consequence, first of all, of not having a public debate about whether this is the right allocation but, most importantly, as a  consequence of deteriorating citizens' confidence that we are authorizing and appropriating the correct amount. 
   In short, keeping this secret from the American people has caused difficulty in retaining their consensus that we ought to be spending an amount of money they do not know in order to collect, analyze, produce, and disseminate intelligence. I think that is a problem for us. 
   Again, I have not done any polling on this, so I don't know. I typically don't poll before I make a decision, to the consternation of my staff and supporters. But my guess is, just from anecdotes, there is a deterioration of confidence. 
   It bothers me because my term on the Intelligence Committee--thanks to the original appointment by our former Democratic leader, George Mitchell, from the great State of Maine, and also Leader DASCHLE's confidence in retaining me on this committee--over time my confidence has increased. 
   Indeed, the argument in my opening statement about this bill is that we have drawn down intelligence investments in the 1990s as we have drawn down our military from roughly 2 million men and women under active duty uniform to 1.35 million. We have also drawn down our intelligence efforts to a point where I don't believe we can do all of the things that need to be done either today or in the future. 
   As I said, I have to collect intelligence. I have to analyze the information. I have skilled people who can analyze it. These images delivered from space very often mean nothing to me when I look at them. It requires somebody who is not only skilled but can process it in a hurry and can make something of it in a hurry. 
   In the situation with India, where we had difficulty warning the President that a test might occur, again, according to published accounts, the Indians were aware that we, first, were able to identify a year earlier they were about to test, and we warned them not to test, as a result of overhead imaging. And they took evasive measures in the future. 
   These are very difficult things to tell. You have to hire skilled people to do it. That is the analysis. The next piece is the production. It is getting very exciting but also very complicated. There is a lot of competition with the private sector to do this production work. 
   Back in the ice age when I was on the U.S. Navy SEAL team, we were given a map if we were going to do an operation in an area in Vietnam. We would look at a map and say: This is the area we will operate in. The map might be 10 years old. Then we would supplement that with human intelligence. Somebody would say: There are some changes here that aren't quite the same as the map. 
   Today an image is used. It is enhanced. It is remarkable how quickly we can deliver very accurate pictures of theaters of operation to the warfighter to disseminate differently, produced in a much different way, and enable that warfighter to have a competitive edge on the battlefield. 
   Indeed, anybody who is thinking about becoming an enemy of the United States of America knows we have tremendous capability on the intelligence side. We get warnings, and those warnings are delivered when threats begin to build. Oftentimes a mere warning enables the heading off of a potential threat that could have erupted into a serious conflict and would have resulted in a loss of lives. 
   The effort to collect, analyze, produce, and disseminate to the right person at the right time, and to make a decision, is not only complicated, but it is also quite expensive. It is not done accidentally. 
   I hope this year is a watershed year and we are able to authorize additional resources for our intelligence agencies. If we don't, at some point we will have a Director of Central Intelligence in the future deliver the bad news to Congress that there is something we want to do but we can't because we cannot accomplish the mission we want to accomplish--not just because of resources but also because it is getting harder and harder to do things we have in the past taken for granted, such as intercept signals, conversations, or communications of some kind between one bad person and another bad person with hostile intent against the United States. 
   Increasingly, we are seeing a shift in two big ways away from nation states. In the old days, we could pass sanctions legislation or do something against a government that was doing something we didn't like. What do we do if Osama bin Laden starts killing Americans or narcoterrorists or cyberterrorists say they hate the United States of America and are going to take action against us? It is very difficult--indeed, it is impossible--for diplomacy to reduce that threat. We need to intercept and try to prevent it and, very often, try to prevent it with a forceful intervention. 
   Not only is it shifting away from the nation state, making it harder both to collect and to do the other work--the analysis, the processing and dissemination, or production of dissemination--the signals are becoming more complex and difficult to process, and they are becoming more and more encrypted. 
   I have had conversations with the private sector, people in the software business, who say we have to change this export regimen that makes it difficult for these companies to sell encryption overseas. This administration has made tremendous accommodation within the industry to try to accommodate their need to sell to companies that are doing business all over the world. 
   Don't doubt there is a national security issue here. There is significant interception, both on the national security side 
   and the law enforcement side. That encryption at 128 bits or higher is actually deployed. We will find our people in the intelligence side coming back and saying: Look, I know something bad happened, and do you want to know why I didn't know? I will tell you why I didn't know. I couldn't make sense of the signal. We intercept, and all we get is a buzz and background noise. We cannot interpret it. We can't convert it. 
   In the old days, we converted with a linguist or some other technological application. In the new world, we are being increasingly denied access to the signals. As described by the technical advisory group that was established on the Intelligence Committee, it was described as number of needles in the haystack but the haystack is getting larger and larger and harder, as a result, for the intelligence people to do the work they need to do. 
   The chairman is moving to the floor. I know he will make a brilliant and articulate statement. 
   Earlier, the Senator from New Mexico offered a statement on his amendment that he hopes to offer tomorrow. Senator LEVIN was here as well. I believe there is reason to be encouraged that we will move this bill quickly tomorrow, and reasonably encouraged, as well, that the differences which still exist on this bill can be resolved, and we can get a big bipartisan vote and move this on to conference. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the Senator from Georgia does not have to stay for this, but I agree with the fundamental principle the Senator from Georgia laid out. I may come at it slightly differently. 
   There have been a lot of arguments about income tax cuts and why they are needed. I call to my colleagues' attention, one of the biggest reasons is the total amount of taxes we are currently taking from the American people which totals 20.7 percent of U.S. income. That is the highest it has been since 1945, and it continues to go up. 
   I believe we need to measure and look at that very carefully as we decide how much in taxes we are going to take from the American people. I put myself on the side of I believe at least the fundamental principle about which the Senator from Georgia talked. There are many ways to cut taxes, and I want to talk about one way to do so this afternoon. 
   I rise today to talk about the introduction of a bipartisan bill called the Bipartisan Social Security Reform Act of 1999. It is the only bipartisan, bicameral--it has been introduced in the House as well--Social Security reform bill, and it is the only bill that can claim to cut taxes, cut programmatic costs, leave current retirees' benefits untouched, and it substantially increases the benefit checks of women and low- and moderate-income workers. This reform plan is a reform plan for all generations. 
   First, in our bill, current seniors--those who are eligible either for the old age, survivor, or disability benefits who have not had time to financially prepare for benefit changes--will not face any benefit cuts. 
   Second, current workers--the baby boomers and the generation Xers--will participate in a modernized and strengthened Social Security program. Our proposal gives all current and future workers a 2-percentage point payroll tax cut which they can invest in individual investment accounts. That is a $928 billion tax cut over the next 10 years. 
   Indeed, as I will illustrate with my presentation, what Congress should consider, when we consider the payroll tax, is do we want to take that payroll tax and pay off the national debt. 
   I favor a substantial debt reduction. Under our proposal, instead of going all for debt reduction, that $928 billion will be accumulated as an asset in 137 million working American households. That will add to the net worth of American working families. It is, in my view, a preferable way of dealing with the payroll taxes. It gives the baby boomers and generation Xers who have time to plan under our proposal not only a payroll tax cut, but it gives them an opportunity to invest in their future. At retirement, these workers will receive the traditional monthly benefit check. We preserve not only the old age benefit, but we preserve intact the survivor and disability benefit. This traditional defined benefit will be supplemented by the retirement wealth they have accumulated in their individual savings accounts. 
   Third, future workers--that is, those who are born after 1995--will not only get to participate in individual savings accounts, but they will get to start saving for their retirement at birth through our bill's KidSave account program. 
   Through KidSave accounts, all children will be given a stake in the American economy and a chance to build substantial retirement wealth at the same time. Each child born in the United States will receive $3,500 to invest in their retirement. When a child takes his or her first job, he or she will be able to contribute 2 percentage points of their payroll tax to the KidSave account. 
   Not only is this a plan for all generations--it is a plan for all income levels. Our plan has something for every wage earner. It will result in substantially higher benefit checks for low- and moderate-income workers. It will result in substantially lower taxes for high-income workers, and it has a combination of higher benefits and lower taxes for middle-income workers. 
   I have brought with me some examples of how real Nebraskans would be affected by our legislation. These charts compare Social Security benefit checks under current law with Social Security benefit checks under the Senate bipartisan Social Security reform plan. 
   The first example is a friend of mine by the name of Verner Magnuson, a retired farmer from Oakland, NE. This chart says, 75-plus. I do not think Verner would object to me telling you he was born in 1915. So Verner obviously is an individual who says: Well, what do I benefit from additional savings? He is exactly right. He does not have time to save and benefit from the buildup in cash that can occur by taking advantage of compounding interest rates. 
   So under current law, Verner receives a benefit check of approximately $1,500 per month. Under our bill, his check will be exactly the same, $1,500--and it will continue to grow with inflation from year to year. We make no adjustment in Verner's CPI nor in anybody's CPI over the age of 62. 
   The second example shows an Omaha resident and the divisional social services director for the Salvation Army, Linda Burkle. Linda, who has a relatively high income--although she may object to that description--demonstrates how higher income individuals will experience somewhat lower monthly benefits under our Social Security plan--at least during the transition period. These temporary benefit reductions for high-income people will only occur until the new Social Security program--that is to say, with individual accounts--is fully phased in. At that point high-income people will not experience reductions in overall benefits. These are temporary benefit reductions for higher income people, and they will only occur until a new program with individual accounts is fully phased in. 
   You can see from this chart that a baby boomer with a low or moderate income will still have a higher income benefit in our plan than under current law. A moderate-income worker, for example, will receive a monthly benefit check of $673 under current law. Since Linda will become eligible to retire for old-age benefits in 2020, her benefit check will not reflect the large benefit cuts that are expected to occur in 2034 under current law. 
   I will not spend a great deal of time on this point, but one thing we all need to understand is if we do not change the law, people who are under the age of 45, under current law, according to the trustees of the Social Security Administration, will experience a 25- to 33-percent cut in benefits. Ask them. If any citizen doubts that, call the Social Security Administration. If you are under the age of 45, call them up 
   and ask them: What will my benefits be unless Congress changes the law? And they will tell you that your benefits are going to be cut 25 to 33 percent. 
   I have listened to my colleagues from time to time who say: Gosh, it is not going to run out of money until 2034,  and that is a long time away. Why do anything now? Why should we act now, especially when the choices are hard and people are apt to get upset with you? 
   The answer is, in 1983, when Congress fixed Social Security as it was about ready to not be able to pay benefits, it made a radical departure from the previous plan. In 1983, what Congress said is that we are not going to only fund current beneficiaries; we are going to fund all beneficiaries. 
   That is what the 75-year mark does. It is not just 75 years; we are trying to write the law so that whatever your age, whether you are born this year or you are 16 years old or you are 76 years old, that we can keep the promise we have on the table. 
   We cannot keep the promise we have on the table to the people under the age of 45. It is not just a small haircut they are going to take; it is a big haircut they are going to take. Or there is going to have to be a comparable--actually, a larger tax increase on their children and grandchildren. That is the current law--a big benefit cut for people under the age of 45. 
   You can see from this chart that a baby boomer with a low- or moderate-income will have a higher benefit under our plan than under current law. A moderate-income worker will receive a monthly benefit check of $673 under current law. Under our plan, a low-income worker will receive a benefit of $813. That is a very important point. 
   We believe that the current Social Security Program is not very generous to low- and moderate-income workers. We add what is called under law an additional benefit point. So for that lower wage individual, in my view, not only are there many of them today, but there are apt to be many of them in the future, who are both an important force for economic reasons as well as for moral reasons. We have to make sure that that defined benefit program is sufficient so they can live with some dignity in their retirement years. 
   This plan not only provides them a higher benefit check, it also provides them the thing that I think produces real financial independence, and that is ownership of some financial assets. 
   My third example shows how Kelly Walters, a 20-something generation Xer from Columbus, NE, will fare under our Social Security reform bill. Generation X is the first generation that will experience very significant benefit increases from our Social Security reform plan. If Kelly earns the average wage over her lifetime, she can expect to get a benefit check, under current law--assuming no tax increases--of $884 per month. Under our reform plan, she can expect to get a Social Security benefit check worth $1,329 per month. That is a 50-percent increase in benefits over current law. If she turns out to be a low-income worker throughout her lifetime, Kelly can expect to get a $536 monthly check under current law but a $1,115 benefit under our new plan. That is more than double the benefit under current law. 
   One of the very difficult things we are experiencing, as the occupant of the Chair knows--he was on the Ways and Means 
   Committee in the House, and I look forward to the day when he is on the Finance Committee as well--but as the occupant of the Chair understands, what we have is a situation where people are living longer. Generation Xers are probably going to be looking forward to living to the age of 85 or 90. So it is very important that that defined benefit program be solid for them. It is also very important that they have the financial assets and wealth that allows them to sustain themselves through to the course of their old-age years. 
   My fourth and final example shows how the next generation of children will fare under our Social Security reform plan. 
   Erin Kuehl, who is only 2 years old today, will benefit not only from the 2-percent account but also from the KidSave account I described earlier. Under the current Social Security system, Erin can expect to have a Social Security benefit worth $1,037 if she earns the average pay. Under our plan, she will receive a monthly benefit worth $2,693. If she becomes a low-income worker, Erin will receive a benefit worth $629 under the current system and $1,631 under the new system--again, more than one and a half times her current expected benefit. 
   Many people get confused about this because they will look at the existing benefit plan and they will say: Well, that is not true. Under what shows up on her benefits, Erin is going to get a much larger check. But that assumes that Congress is going to raise taxes. The President said he is against raising payroll taxes. That presumes that Congress somehow is going to come up with some additional money. If anybody wants to do that, let them come down and argue for that. Let them come down and make a presentation or a proposal to raise taxes even more on people who get paid by the hour than we have under current law. 
   The message with our proposal is very clear: Our bill provides better benefits for low- and moderate-income workers. And although some high-income individuals will temporarily experience slightly lower benefits during the transition from the old system to the new system, all workers in America will eventually experience higher benefits and lower taxes than current law provides. 
   In Nebraska alone, there are over 283,000 Social Security beneficiaries: 182,000 have an old-age benefit; 35,000 are taking the survivor or widower benefit; and the balance are in the disability program. The average monthly check under the old-age benefit is $753 for retired workers. For the widower, it is $740. 
   Not only is $753 not a livable monthly benefit, that is an average. That means many are getting substantially lower than that. Even in Nebraska, that is not adequate, unless it is supplemented by additional wealth and income from pensions and personal savings. This is an even lower amount and not likely to provide that individual with what they are going to need, especially with longer lifespans projected out into the future. 
   Our bill will ensure workers have larger benefits. Our bill also ensures they have wealth with which to supplement their retirement income. 
   There are tradeoffs in our bill. Although our reforms will ensure lower taxes and higher benefits from future workers, our bill does call for programmatic changes which will lower the guaranteed defined benefit check for some middle and upper workers in the future. 
   I don't want to sugarcoat this. Unless you are for a tax increase, if you want to walk out on the floor and say, let's raise taxes, you also favor at some point lowering benefit checks. If you don't like the idea that we are making some adjustments out in the future in benefit checks--and again, for emphasis, if you are watching this and you are over the age of 62, please don't call my office and say I am cutting your benefits. I am not. This proposal does not cut benefits for people over the age of 62. It makes adjustments out in the future. Again, if you don't like those adjustments, come down to the floor and say you want to raise taxes because that is the only option to making these kinds of adjustments. 
   Our bill includes a provision which instructs the Bureau of Labor Statistics to study overestimates in the CPI and correct them accordingly. When the recommendation was made well over a year ago now, it was a commission that studied this. They came back and said that the CPI was overstated 1.1 and we ought to make an adjustment, and nothing happened. I guarantee you, if they had come back and said that it is understated 1.1, there would have been 535 votes for it. It would have been unanimous in the House and Senate. But because it is overstated, we recognize that the adjustment is going to mean somebody is going to have to give up something. We make that adjustment for beneficiaries out into the future. 
   We think this will result in a downward adjustment in the CPI and COLAs of .5 percent. It brings the CPI much more closely in line with what real cost-of-living increases are. It doesn't reduce the cost-of-living increase. It brings us a much more accurate cost of living. In addition, the CPI adjustments will affect income tax revenues. I do not argue that it will not. But our bill allows the Social Security Administration to recapture these initial income tax revenues for the Social Security trust fund. 
   Another benefit change in our bill is the indexation of benefits to life expectancy. Earlier I introduced a bill with Senator MOYNIHAN that would  have moved the eligibility age. It set off a howl, a protest, and concern. I listened to those concerns. By the way, in 1997, we had 1.3 million old-age beneficiaries who became eligible for Social Security's old-age 
   benefit. Of those 1.3 million, 1.1 million took the early benefits at 62. So when news commentators try to figure out what this does, they typically say: KERREY is proposing to move the retirement age. Not true. We are talking about eligibility age, when you are eligible for the benefit. By the way, this bill would also eliminate the earnings test that is still present. That earnings test is gone. So whenever you are eligible, if you want to continue working, that is fine under our proposal. 
   But this change to index benefits to life expectancy is a response to people saying: Don't move the eligibility age. We keep the eligibility age exactly as it is under current law. We do accelerate the move from 65 to 67. 
   Once the retirement age increases to 67, as under current law, our bill will provide for benefits that track the life expectancy of your birth cohort. I think we made that adjustment so we do not accelerate it until 67, or do we? We do? I was right the first time. 
   Our bill will provide for benefits, as I said, that track the life expectancy of your birth cohort. The longer your birth cohort lives, the more years over which your benefits must be spread. This may mean that retirees far in the future may experience a lower defined benefit under our program, but again, it does not affect the value of their individual account. 
   We have several other benefit changes in our bill, but those are the two big ones. I disclose them up front. 
   There is a price. Again, I say, for the third time, for those who object to it, what is your alternative? What else do you want to do? I graduated from the University of Nebraska in 1965 with a B.S. in pharmacy. It is a land grant college. I am not a Rhodes scholar. I didn't go to Yale University. I don't have a Ph.D. behind my name. 
   This is not difficult to figure out. The difficulty is looking at the 10 or 12 options and saying: Oh, my gosh, I don't want to pick any of those because somebody is going to get mad at me. Somebody will object to it. Somebody will criticize it. 
   Criticize the changes if you want, and there will be many who do, but if you are an elected official, if you are an elected representative, I hope people outside, after they have leveled their criticism will say: What is your solution? Or are you suggesting that people under the age of 45 should just be basically out of luck because we don't expect to have to worry about them in our political lifetimes or perhaps even in our physical lifetimes. 
   Ultimately, the public must decide whether it is willing to risk some benefit adjustments and some benefit uncertainty for the long-term gains that come with a Social Security program that includes individual accounts. Furthermore, the public must weigh the costs and benefit adjustments against the cost of doing nothing. As I said, the cost of doing nothing, if you favor doing nothing, if you favor delay, what that means is you favor, unless you have an alternative, you favor a 25 to 33 percent cut in benefits for people under the age of 45 because that is what current law provides. 
   This is a reform proposal that Republicans and Democrats are supporting and should be supporting. If Congress wants to get serious about Social Security reform, this is the bill to mark up. If Members want to stop talking about saving Social Security--we just had a cloture vote on the lockbox proposal. 
   Democrats have a lockbox proposal. Everybody wants to save Social Security. If you want to save Social Security, this is the bill to rally behind. If the President, who cannot run for reelection, wants to save Social Security, this is the bill for him to embrace as well. If the public wants the politicians to enact Social Security reform legislation that shares costs across generations, protects benefits and lowers tax burdens, this is the bill to write their Congressman about. 
   You may detect frustration in my voice. I have been frustrated in recent weeks by our difficulty to come to a resolution of this problem. We do talk a great deal about it. I understand the difficulty. I do not underestimate the political difficulties of solving this problem. The difficulty, in my judgment, is not picking the solution. This is not like Medicare. This is not like youth violence. There are lots of things out there that are extremely complicated, that are very difficult to figure out. This one is not difficult to figure out. You just, in the end, must select which proposals, which solutions you want. 
   The Congressional Budget Office, the office that dictates what we do far too often around here, and the Office of Management and Budget, the executive office, recently released their midsession review that projected surpluses of $2.9 trillion over the next 10 years, 65 percent of which comes from excess FICA taxes. 
   What I find to be odd in our current debate is that from 1983 to 1999, after we raised taxes on working people in 1983 to prefund all Americans who were going to be eligible in the future, we raised taxes then. Every single year what Treasury does is, any excess tax, it credits the Social Security Administration with a treasury bond, an asset that has real value. This year at the start of the year, that is about $860 billion that the Social Security Administration owns for future beneficiaries. It will be over $1 trillion at the end of this year because there will be $130 billion of revenue taxes, taxation of benefits and the interest off these bonds that flow into the Social Security trust fund. The Social Security trust fund will own over $1 trillion of the bonds. It will build up to $4.5 trillion in the year 2014. From 1983 to 1999, what we did was, we ended up, after the trust fund owns bonds, Treasury ends up with cash. It ends up with cash. And it has been using that cash for all sorts of things. It has to buy something. 
   So basically what this excess did was made the deficit look smaller. So from 1983 to 1999, people who got paid by the hour--and 80 percent of Americans have higher FICA taxes than they have in income taxes--people who get paid by the hour shouldered a disproportionate share of deficit reduction. 
   Now, in 1999, that the deficit is gone and we are at a surplus, what the lockbox says is that people who get paid by the hour are going to shoulder all of the debt reduction. Every single penny of debt reduction under the President's proposal, the Democratic proposal, and the Republican proposal is paid for with payroll taxes, FICA taxes. So what we say with our proposal is not only do we want to give a tax cut to people who get paid by the hour--almost $1 trillion over a 10-year period--but what it effectively does is say that rather than paying down the national debt all of us owe, we will increase the net worth of Americans by transferring that to the asset side of their balance statement. That is basically what it does. At the end of the 10-year period, 137 million working families will have at least $1 trillion of new assets. That assumes no interest, no accumulation on that ownership. 
   Furthermore, each day we let go by means this problem gets harder to solve. This body rarely takes the opportunity to solve future crises. I understand that. I have been in the situation many times before. I urge and beg my colleagues to let the issue of Social Security reform be the exception to the rule. This bipartisan, bicameral bill represents a real effort to work in a truly bipartisan fashion, not just to save Social Security, but to modernize it, strengthen it, and improve it. 
   I urge my fellow Senators to cosponsor this bill and join with us in urging the chairman of the Finance Committee, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and the President to take up and endorse a Social Security reform bill this year. 
   In addition, I announce that I intend, when we mark up a tax bill in the Finance Committee, to offer this piece of legislation as a way to cut substantially more taxes than anybody is currently proposing. 
   I thank my colleagues who are on this bill, including Senator GREGG and Senator BREAUX who are both on the floor today. I am proud to be a cosponsor of it. I praise them for their leadership. They have been fearless and future-looking. When we talk about our kids and grandkids, sometimes we don't often back those words with actions. I praise them for being willing to back, in a very courageous way, their words with action.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Maine heading for the door. With great respect for her, I want her to hear this observation. She talked about continuity of care and said that she and Senator GRASSLEY and Senator ENZI had worked on language in this amendment that provided continuity of care for people with terminal illness. I call her attention to pages 49 and 50 of this bill. It does not do that. It says specifically, under terminal illness, it is subject to paragraph 1, which says the general rule is just for up to 90 days. The only exception under continuity of care with this bill is for pregnancy, which was in the original bill.

   Mr. KERREY. I only have 3 minutes. I am sorry. 
   I call the Senator's attention to continuity of care. Look at the language of the bill because on page 49 it describes this transitional period. 
   This is something that is very important to me. I received health care in 1969 after I was injured in Vietnam. I have a very passionate concern for people now who are in managed care. 
   I must say, the problem we are experiencing with managed care is not self-funded ERISA plans. That is what the Republican proposal is going to do. It is going to solve almost a nonexistent problem that may, in fact, as a consequence of setting the bar low, encourage people who are in HMOs and who are in the marketplace providing those plans to say: I see the bar is low; we are going down to that lower standard. That is a major concern I have with this proposal. It does not cover the plans that are the biggest problem. 
   I call your attention to pages 49 and 50. Under the 
   continuity of care provisions, the only continuity of care that would be provided would be women who are pregnant. They could go beyond 90 days under this provision, but those who were terminal would not. Terminal illness is subject to paragraph 1, according to the language of the bill itself, which does not provide for an extension. 
   Our proposal would go beyond those three general categories, not just terminal illness, not just institutionalized  people, not just women who are pregnant--all three reasonable--and certainly not just self-funded ERISA plans, which are hardly receiving any complaints at all. 
   That is the odd thing about this debate. We are going to take care of a problem that doesn't exist under the guise of--I have heard people come down saying: We are going to address a problem with HMOs. Well, you would address the problem of HMOs if you changed your bill. 
   This bill doesn't take care of HMOs. It takes care of self-funded ERISA plans. Go to your mailbox and see if you have any complaints about self-funded ERISA plans. You won't find any complaints about that. The complaints are about HMOs. 
   We have watched the market move more and more into business decisions when it comes to health care. And I am for the market. I like what the market can do. When we regulate the market, we say----

   Mr. KERREY. That is correct. 
   Mr. President, this proposed change in the law would provide protection for every single American who has health insurance in this country--not just those that are in self-funded ERISA plans, as the Republican alternative would do. That is the most important distinction. I have been asked, well, if our amendment fails, will I vote for the Republican alternative? My answer is no. I believe that would be a step backward because it will say to the marketplace that you can fall to the lowest possible standard, which is what the Republican proposal does. 
   Every step of the way, we have seen a sort of grudging retreat from our challenge to change the law and intervene in the marketplace. There is cost to this, Mr. President; I acknowledge that cost. But as with all regulation, we have to measure the cost versus the benefit. That is what we intend to do with this amendment--talk about the benefit to people who will be able to get continuity of care, and not just if they are pregnant, which the Republicans included in their earlier alternative, but to take care of people with terminal illness, for example. I understand it that there will be a modification to the Republican bill on this point. But you have to be declared terminal. 
   What if you have cancer and you believe you are going to survive treatment? What if you have diabetes or some other complicated medical condition, and you established, over the years, a relationship with your physician who watched for changes in your physical condition, looked at your symptoms and determined the kind of treatment and response to those symptoms, and suddenly you are told your doctor was either removed from the managed care group, which happens, or your doctor changes venue and moves to some other locality and you are told by your managed care organization that you have to pick a different doctor. Your relationship with this physician is over. 
   This amendment puts the law on the side of those individuals and says you can continue care with that doctor for 90 days for most conditions, and for three conditions this time can be extended. It is reasonable. 
   Is there cost? Yes. Measure the cost against the benefit of having the law on your side when it comes time that you are told that your doctor now is different and you have had a relationship with that doctor. The doctor has diagnosed your cancer and told you here is the treatment, or has been your doctor treating your diabetes or your cardiovascular disease, or your doctor has told you what the treatment is going to be, and suddenly you have a new doctor. You have to pick somebody new. That is what this amendment does. It puts the law on the side of every single American, not just those in self-funded ERISA plans, as the Republican version would do. This takes care of everyone. 
   I have real passion on this subject because on the 14th of March, 1969, I was a healthy human being with the U.S. Navy SEAL team, and I thought I could accomplish everything on my own. I didn't think I needed any law to support me or take care of my needs. Then I was injured. In an instant, I went from being able to take care of myself on my own to not being able to do anything at all, including going to the bathroom, without asking somebody else for help. So they sent me to the Philadelphia Naval Hospital, and I recovered there. 
   Well, in 1989, when I came to the Senate, I was fortunate enough to be able to be a member of the Appropriations Committee, and we were marking up a bill--a law that this body considered. It occurred to me we were appropriating money for military hospitals--including the one that I had gone to in 1969. Well, in 1969, I didn't understand the relationship between that law and me. That hospital was not there because of Sears & Roebuck. 
   I love the marketplace. I come from the business sector and I love what the market can do. But the market has limitations. My 
   life was saved by a hospital that was authorized by this Congress. The appropriations were authorized by this Congress not because I made a financial contribution, not because I was able to come and influence anybody in this Congress--there wasn't a politician in America in 1969 I liked, let alone been willing to make a contribution to. Yet Congress passed, and the President signed, a law which saved my life--not the marketplace but a law. 
   Was there cost? You're darn right there was cost. What was the benefit to the rest of America? I hope the benefit was being able to say we live in a country where we want our Congress to pass laws to take care of our own. We want to take care of each other. It isn't just about me. I am healthy today, and the independence I have and the health I have came as a consequence of that law. That law gave me independence. 
   Roughly 10 days ago, we all celebrated the Fourth of July. That is Independence Day. This Nation has an over 200-year tradition of making independence meaningful by fighting against illiteracy, fighting against intolerance, and fighting against illness. If you are sick or disabled and you don't have health insurance and reliable health care, you are not likely to feel independent. It is likely to be meaningless to you. 
   So what this amendment does is to say if you have a relationship with a doctor, and the doctor is treating you, and the market determines that the doctor no longer can treat you, you will have a right, under the law, to  continue to have the care of that physician for 90 days. If it is one of the three exceptional conditions, this right can be extended. 
   As I say, there is cost. I don't disregard the cost at all. I have heard many Senators come down and talk about how this is going to increase the cost of our insurance. I am willing to pay it. Why? Because Americans were willing to pay the bills for me. That is why we are a great country. We don't just take care of ourselves; we take care of each other. We recognize, as great as the marketplace is, as wonderful as free enterprise is in creating jobs and generating wealth, there are limits. If all we care about is the bottom line and generating profit for our businesses, we will forget the need to put the law on the side of human beings when, through no fault of their own, the bottom drops out of their lives. 
   So I hope and pray that the Republicans will give this amendment consideration. It is the last amendment we will consider before we shut this thing down permanently. At least for the rest of this week, we are not going to have a chance to change the law and put it on the side of Americans out there who desperately need it. 
   I understand there are costs to it. If I talk to people in Nebraska and they ask why we do this, I will not only use myself as an example, I will use hundreds of others who had the law on their side. Medicare beneficiaries have had the law on their side, and they are better off as a consequence. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, Economic Reform Today is a quarterly magazine published by the Center for International Private Investment. CIPE is one of the core grantees of the National Endowment for Democracy and is dedicated to promoting democratic governance and market oriented economic reform. Their work has been particularly important in assisting the ongoing transition to free markets in the former communist countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. 
   The article I will include in the RECORD, highlights Russia's continuing effort to implement political and economic reforms. This has been a painful process in Russia. However, it is my firm belief that Russia's transition to a free-market democracy will be measured in decades, not years. During this important time--CIPE and the other NED grantees--have been working to ensure that the Russian people have access to the information and resources necessary to make a successful transition. 
   Again, I encourage my colleagues to read this important article.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I want to explain my opposition to the Lautenberg amendment giving ONDCP's National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign jurisdiction to include underage alcohol consumption for the purposes of the media campaign. Like all my colleagues, I have seen the results of underage drinking, and I deplore them. Young lives should not be wasted, and I challenge the White House and my colleagues to continue to take action to curb this problem. 
   However, I do not believe this amendment is the correct way to solve the underage drinking crisis. The Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign is not the right vehicle for anti-alcohol messages. The Office of National Drug Control Policy fights the war on drugs, not alcohol. I agree with Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey that there is an important distinction between illegal drugs and alcohol, which is a legal substance. Additionally, simply adding anti-alcohol messages to the ONDCP's Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign without appropriating more funds for this purpose will dilute the anti-drug efforts. Resources which are badly needed to fight drugs will be rerouted to fight underage drinking. I cannot support a bill which chooses to fight alcohol at the expense of illegal drugs. 
   I have supported in the past, and will continue to support, programs that discourage underage drinking. In fact, I want to applaud the efforts of alcohol distributers, who have initiated many of these important programs. 
   Let us find a different way to take action against underage alcohol consumption that does not compromise our actions against the use of illegal drugs.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, as I have stated before, the debate surrounding Y2K Liability is a very important one. The estimated cost associated with Y2K issues vary greatly,  ranging from $600 billion to $1.6 trillion worldwide. The amount of litigation that will result from Y2K-related failures is uncertain, but at least one study has guestimated the costs for Y2K related litigation and damages to be at $300 billion. 
   With that in mind, Congress has been debating legislation which encourages companies to prevent Y2K failures and to remedy problems quickly if they occur, and to deter frivolous lawsuits. Although I support the goals of the bill that passed the Senate last month, I voted against that bill because I did not feel it provided enough protection for consumers. 
   I am pleased to see that changes were made in the Conference Report that address my concerns and provide protection for consumers. Because of these important changes, I intend to support the Y2K Liability Conference Report. Many of my colleagues have pointed out positive changes to this bill. I would like to highlight just two provisions that will put consumers in a better position with respect to Y2K litigation. 
   The first provision concerns proportionate liability. Exceptions to the general rule of proportionate liability were made to ensure ordinary consumers are protected and ``bad actor'' defendants are not rewarded. These bad actor defendants, those who act recklessly, will bear a higher proportion of liability for otherwise uncollectible damage claims. This both protects consumer plaintiffs and provides companies with an incentive to identify and remedy Y2K problems. 
   The second provision deals with the duty to mitigate. Under the bill, plaintiffs have a duty to mitigate damages, which means that they have a duty to fix computer problems that could have been reasonably avoided. The Conference Report adds an important exception to this rule. Consumers who rely on fraudulent misrepresentations made by defendants about Y2K readiness will be exempted from this duty to mitigate. In other words, if a computer company tells a consumer in bad faith that his computer is ``Y2K compliant'' and that turns out to be false, the consumer will be in a better position to recover damages from that bad faith defendant. 
   The Y2K issue is a very unique, once in a millennium, problem. Because it is so unique, I agree that legislation is needed. I believe this legislation now strikes a proper balance between consumers and the high tech industry---computer companies have an incentive to identify and remedy potential Y2K problems, and consumers have important protections when faced with bad actor defendants. Therefore, I will cast a vote in support of the Y2K Liability Conference Report.

    Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am pleased to have worked with Senator JEFFORDS to draft the legislation we are introducing today, the Affordable Housing Preservation Act of 1999. The legislation will establish a matching grant program that provides money to states and localities that are willing to put up some of their own funds for the purposes of preserving affordable housing. In order to receive a grant under this program, the owner would have to commit to maintaining the existing affordability restrictions for a minimum of 15 years. 
   In addition, the legislation will encourage transfer of ownership of these properties to non-profit housing corporations that work closely with residents. We believe that non-profit ownership will, in the long run, ensure the maximum possible commitment to affordability at the lowest possible cost. The current ownership structure for assisted housing constantly puts us in this bind of having to provide more and more money just to keep what we have already built and paid for. With non-profits, we will not face the constant dilemma of opt-outs, prepayments or expiring affordability restrictions. Nonetheless, private owners who want to continue to provide affordable housing will be eligible under this bill.  
   I appreciate the efforts of Senator JEFFORDS in facing this problem head-on. We are facing an increasing crisis in affordable housing. Ironically, this crisis worsens as the strong economy pushes rents ever higher, out of the reach of many working Americans and the poor. This legislation will help us preserve this crucial affordable housing resource. 
   In the long run, however, preservation of affordable housing, while necessary, won't solve the problem facing millions of American families. The real problem in many cities around the country is that there is not enough production of new housing. We need to find ways to fund the construction of new, affordable, multifamily housing for low income and working families, and we need to fund the 100,000 additional vouchers we authorized in last year's public housing bill. This is not just a poor person's issue. In many states around the country--Massachusetts, Nevada, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Alaska, and others--a family would need to work as many as three full time jobs at $7 per hour, well above the minimum wage, just to afford the rent on a typical 2 bedroom apartment. This is unsustainable economically, and it is simply not fair. 
   In sum, Mr. President, the Jeffords-Kerry bill builds effectively on efforts HUD is taking to save existing housing stock. Now, we need to provide the funding to make sure these efforts can move forward, as we consider longer term solutions in the months ahead.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, this is about the success of a Federally funded program that was implemented by heroic people in Lincoln, NE--they include principals, schoolteachers, and the Lincoln school board. I am talking about Title I. One of the reasons I talk about it a great deal is that, in Nebraska, there are 17,000 students that are eligible for Title I, but because we don't appropriate enough money, they are not funded. They don't get the benefits of this kind of effort. 
   What this article talks about is a program called Reading Recovery that has been implemented in the Lincoln public school system over the last 3 years--and it's a very rigorous program. The teachers had to train themselves; they had to make a commitment to acquire the skills necessary to implement this program. The article starts off with a parent talking about the exhilaration of seeing his daughter learn how to read and make progress--be successful, in other words. What they have done is quite remarkable. It needs to be observed because citizens need to know that success indeed is possible. 
   Second graders have improved their reading scores 16 percent; third graders, 12 percent; fourth and fifth graders are up 8 percent. These are dramatic increases. They have achieved the increases by starting at a very early age, using Title I moneys, using this Reading Recovery program, and going after young people who are at risk, who are falling behind, who have come into the school system without these reading skills. 
   They have said if you want to lift the overall test scores, quite correctly, you have to help those who are most likely to fail if we don't intervene. That is what Title I is. It is not the Federal Government telling these local schools what to do. We recently passed an Ed-Flex bill that provided increased flexibility. I support that. But unless we provide resources, it is impossible for local heroes to take the money and make something of it. 
   I will point out, in addition to the necessity of an early effort, an additional challenge we face. It's explained in one little paragraph here. Those of us born in 1943 sort of remember schools in the 1950s and 1960s and think, gee, why can't we do it the way we did it? Things have changed. In this article, one little paragraph says the following about this young girl who was given the benefit of this program:  
   She had changed schools three times in kindergarten, just as she was starting to learn, because her mom and dad were splitting up, her dad said.  
   She ended up caught in the middle of a custody battle, a transfer occurred, and as a consequence of the transfer, she fell behind. That is what happened. What Title I enabled her to do was catch up. It is quite a miraculous thing that happened as a consequence, as I said, of significant local commitment and the help of teachers who trained themselves and a principal who was committed. One of the principals is Deann Currin at Elliott Elementary. The Lincoln school board supported Reading Recovery. They used title I money. Again, it is not the Federal Government telling them what to do, but providing them the resources. 
   I regret to say that in Nebraska, there are 17,000 children eligible for Title I programs that simply are not able to benefit because we are not providing a sufficient amount of resources. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today, along with my colleagues Senator DASCHLE and Senator JOHNSON, the Missouri River Valley Improvement Act of 1999. This legislation is important for the 10,000 people who live along the 2,321-mile Missouri River, and marks also the upcoming bicentennial anniversary of the Lewis and Clark expeditions along this great River. The intent of the Act is to improve the environmental qualtiy and public use and appreciation of the Missouri River, and to provide additional authorities to the Army Corps of Engineers to protect, enhance, and restore fish and wildlife habitat as part of their ongoing operations on the River. 
   The Missouri River is a resource of incalculable value to the 10 states which it traverses, but it is a river that has changed dramatically since the pioneering days of Lewis and Clark. The construction of dams and levees over the past 50 years has aided navigation, flood control, and water supply along the Missouri River, but has also reduced habitat for native river fish and wildlife, and resulted in lost opportunities for recreation on the river. 
   The legislation will help to restore a series of nature areas along the river in time to celebrate the 2004 anniversary of the Lewis and Clark, when we are anticipating greatly increased visitation along the river and to the surrounding areas, due in large part to the records and descriptions as detailed by these explorers on their 1804 trip. 
   The bill will also aid native river fish and wildlife, help to restore cottonwoods along the river, reduce flood losses, and enhance recreation and tourism, all vital to the economies and quality of life to our communities along the river. It additional provides authorities for the revitalization of historic riverfronts, similar to the ongoing `Back to the River' revitalization project currently underway in my home state of Nebraska. The Back of the River Project in Nebraska is bringing our families and our businesses back to the Missouri River, for recreational enjoyment as well as for the commercial and business-related opportunities that follow. It is our hope that this will aid other 
   communities to participate in similar efforts in their riverfronts. 
   Another major provision of this bill is the creation of a long-term, science-based monitoring program on the Missouri River. This program, to be developed and operated through the U.S. Geological Survey-Biological Resources Division in Columbia, Missouri, will monitor the physical, biological, and chemical characteristics of the Missouri River. The program will help us to monitor and assess the quality of biota, habitats, and the water itself in this great river, and to provide information that will enhance our understanding of the Missouri, how it is operated, and how future operation decisions may affect the river.  
   We currently do not understand a lot about the river, beyond the physical and some of the habitat-based impacts that have been caused by channelization. This program will create a publicly-accessible database of all the information we do have on the river, and all that is collected through the project, and will help to guide our management of the river in the future. The database will also provide additional opportunities for the people who live along the river to interact with the river in another way, and to learn more about the river that they live near. 
   I have seen how successful educational opportunities related to the River can be, and how excited and involved children and adults get when they learn about and become more involved with their natural resources. The Fontenelle Forest Association in Nebraska, which contains forests and wetlands, and is along the Missouri River, has hands-on exhibits, live animal displays, teaching spaces, and even meeting spaces for Nebraskans. Ken Finch, the Executive Director of the Fontenelle Forest Association, has been instrumental in providing educational programs and opportunities, including a program called H2Omaha, a multi-faceted science education program which uses the Missouri River and its watershed as a living laboratory. I envision that the Missouri River database created by this Improvement Act will greatly expand information and data available to Ken and the participants at Fontenelle Forest, and I know that other communities will find this resource valuable, as well. 
   I have also seen successful restoration efforts on the river--efforts like Boyer Chute and Hamburg Bend in Nebraska--both side channels created with the aid of the Corps of Engineers. These side channels have been enormously successful in restoring lost habitat for river species by creating slower-moving, more shallow waterways parallel to the river. These restoration areas have attracted not just wildlife, such as the native fish and birds and even river otter that historically lived in large numbers on the Missouri, but have also attracted canoeists and hikers who enjoy the scenic beauty and the recreational opportunities that these sites offer. This bill will help communities to create additional restoration projects like this along the river, projects that will not impact existing uses of the river, but that will add immensely to recreational and wildlife opportunities, and that will also add additional flood protection to surrounding communities. 
   In anticipation of the greatly increased visitation along the river that will occur with the Lewis and Clark bicentennial celebration, the bill additionally will establish Lewis and Clark Interpretive Centers to educate the public about the Missouri River, and will allow the Corps of Engineers to provide enhancements to recreational facilities and visitors centers. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues who represent the states and communities along the Missouri River to look closely at this bill, and to join me and the other cosponsors of the bill in supporting this important legislation. The Missouri River Valley Improvement Act of 1999 will help to restore and improve our access and enjoyment of the river, and will provide vital economic, recreational, and educational opportunities for everyone who lives along and visits this great river, the Crown Jewel of the midwest.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to call my colleagues' attention to the current conflict between India and Pakistan over the line of control of Kashmir. I have a great deal of respect for the problem of watching situations that are not only a long way away from us but are so remote that it is hard to get a camera crew there. I fear that is what is going on. A lot of cameras and journalists are in Kosovo watching the return of refugees and watching the United States troops come back into that region, as well they should. 
   There is a real danger in not watching and paying attention to what is going on between India and Pakistan, and there is a danger that our lack of attention to this particular problem could produce a confrontation that not only would be deadly but would draw in the rest of the world as well. 
   One of my principal concerns about the Kosovo operation, though I supported the bombing and I am pleased it is over and pleased that we have had some measure of success, was that it drew our attention away from non-NATO missions. The United States of America, unlike many of our NATO allies--indeed, unlike most of our NATO allies--has very important missions that we are performing throughout the world. 
   India and Pakistan is one of those missions. We were all surprised last year--and nobody should be surprised this time around--after India and Pakistan detonated nuclear weapons--surprised our State Department, surprised our CIA. We had a hearing trying to figure out why we were not able to predict this, even though the Prime Minister who won the race for the Parliament had, as part of his party platform, a promise to detonate and become a nuclear power. I do not think we should have been surprised. We were surprised. 
   We should not be surprised in this situation if this deteriorates into an additional war. India and Pakistan have had not only three wars since independence in the last 50 years, but there have been many serious and deadly skirmishes that have taken place over the line of control in Kashmir. 
   This could not only deteriorate again, and there is a bloody battle going on as we speak, but in addition to that, unlike the United States and the Soviet Union that over the last 50 years developed protocols to deal with nuclear weapons--and we have fairly substantial impressive margins for error--there have been no such discussions between India and Pakistan. Both of them are nuclear powers. Both of them could detonate nuclear weapons and use nuclear weapons in a confrontation of this kind. 
   I have come before the Senate only to say to my colleagues I hope we pay an increasing amount of attention to what is clearly an issue that is vital to the security of the United States of America. This is not one where there is any doubt. It is a good example of the kind of non-NATO mission to which the United States of America, our diplomats, and our warfighters have to pay attention. This is a region of the world that is extremely unstable at the minute, and that instability could produce a confrontation with deadly consequences to us and deadly consequences to our interests in the region as well. 
   Just because it does not appear on this evening's news or in the newspapers, or it does not appear we are getting lengthy stories and coverage of the problems going on between India and Pakistan in Kashmir right now, no one should be surprised if, through our own failure to intervene with both significant diplomacy and other efforts, this confrontation gets larger and, as a consequence, we find ourselves suffering an awful lot more than the suffering we are currently seeing in Kosovo. 
   Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak. I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I had intended to come over and talk on the ag appropriations bill. I am not going to talk about the ag appropriations bill since we are not on it. I am going to talk about a couple of amendments I intend to offer, if we ever get to that point. I will put us back into a quorum call when I am through. 
   There are many important things in this ag appropriations bill that I strongly support. I have a great deal of respect and appreciation for the work that both Senator COCHRAN and Senator KOHL have done on this piece of legislation. Every appropriator, every Senator who has the responsibility of working on the Appropriations Committee, understands we are seeing a decline, a deterioration in our capacity to invest in our future as a result of a growing problem we have with our budget; that is, a larger and larger share that is going to mandatory programs and a smaller and smaller share available for these long-term investments, whether it is in soil, whether it is in research, all the other things that are in this particular piece of legislation. The problem is only going to get worse. 
   I didn't come to talk about that, but I did feel obliged to say I understand that all these men and women who serve on the Appropriations Committee are under an awful lot of pressure, and that pressure is going to grow. 
   We currently take from the American people about 20.5 percent of GDP to spend on Federal programs. That one-fifth of total GDP that we have been taking for the last 50 or 60 years has remained relatively constant, though at 20.5 it has not been at that high level since 1945. 
   I say that only because there is an upper limit as to what we can take. I think we are there. Indeed, I support cutting taxes right now; I believe we can cut taxes. Indeed, part of the reason I am for it is that, at 20.5, in order to send a signal, we need to understand there is an upper limit. Otherwise, we are apt to spend it on a variety of things, and all the fiscal discipline we have had throughout most of this decade will be evaporated in a hurry. 
   But as to this bill itself, whenever it becomes appropriate, I intend to offer a couple amendments. As I said, while this piece of legislation does support a number of very important aspects of agriculture spending, from agriculture research to food stamps, in fact, it can't, given its mission, address the enormous amount of changes sweeping across rural Nebraska. I get calls all the time from farmers who ask me: Does anybody in Washington understand what is going on? I answer, genuinely, yes. I think both Republicans and Democrats are scratching their heads trying to figure out what we can do. 
   I was encouraged by the chairman's comments during the markup of the dire emergency supplemental bill for Kosovo; he does understand that both Republicans and Democrats understand there is a need to do an additional supplemental appropriations bill at some time for emergency purposes to help agriculture. But this merely underscores the problem we are experiencing in rural America today. Unfortunately, what is happening is that family farmer, who very often has a job outside of agriculture, is not certain there is any opportunity left. 
   I want to say to my colleagues, though, I am very much a free market person; I support free trade. I believe we ought to have rules and laws that support the free enterprise system. 
   In agriculture, we do a lot more on these family farms than just produce food. The food is important, a vital part of our export strategy, and it has economic value that one cannot deny. But these farms produce human beings. All of us who have had the pleasure of working with boys and girls who are working for the 4-H organization, or the Future Farmers of America, when you see these young men and women, you see kids with unusually good character and values that are acquired as a result of living in an environment where you understand that this biblical motto that says you can't reap what you don't sow is true; where you live constantly in an environment of understanding that, though you may have a good or a bad farm program, and like or not like what is going on in Congress, still the most important act you have is the act that occurs when you are on your knees in the morning, or in  evening, or you are bowing your head at lunch or supper and praying and being grateful for what you have but hoping that Mother Nature delivers enough and the right amount of rain, enough and the right amount of other conditions that are necessary in order to produce this product. 
   As the distinguished occupant of the Chair knows, being from Arkansas, food production is unusual because, unlike manufacturing businesses, it is produced out of doors. It may seem like an obvious fact, but in my businesses I regulate the environment. I have an air conditioner; I have a heater; I have a furnace that produces heat in the winter; and I have an air conditioner that produces cool air in the summertime. I can control that environment 365 days a year. I did get wiped out once by a tornado in 1975, but I don't, in the normal course of business, worry about hail or about not getting enough rain. I don't have a growing season where I can be wiped out with a 
   single event, and I don't have all my annual sales gone just like that as a result of something way beyond my control. 
   So we understand that we have basics that we are dealing with. I hope we understand that agriculture produces people with values. There is a rural policy aspect of our farm program that is not really economic. We want people to live in rural America. We understand that our program has to provide them with some hope of economic prosperity, and we understand that these farms produce more than just some thing, some commodity that has economic value. 
   The question is how to do that. We had a great debate in 1995 over Freedom to Farm. Though I didn't vote for it, let me say that I was very sympathetic to the idea that the Government should not be out there regulating every single thing the farmer does. Under the old farm program, that happened. Farmers were saying to me: I am not making decisions anymore. All my decisions are made down at the Farm Service Agency. I have to go down and find out from USDA and Soil Conservation Service and other people what I can do before I make plans. 
   They wanted those handcuffs taken off. They were also very uncomfortable and not happy with the Government's performance in owning grain reserves. They watched the Government operate those reserves at times that caused the price to go low and subsidies to go up, and then their neighbors were saying to them: You are farming for your welfare check. 
   They didn't like being on welfare. I am not here this morning to attack Freedom to Farm, but I do think there are a number of things about our underlying law that deserve attention and deserve modification. 
   First of all, we are spending way more than we thought we were going to spend. Last year, we spent $20 billion. It is estimated we will spend more than that this year. We have an Uruguay Round commitment not to spend more than $19 billion on production or price-related support. We are already at $12 billion to $13 billion, and there is an anticipation that there will be additional spending, especially for loan deficiency payments under the soybean program. 
   The Commodity Credit Corporation is out of money for the first time since 1987. CCC borrowing has an authority of $30 billion, so this is not what we considered to be too low of a ceiling but with the combination of direct payments, loan deficiency payments, dairy price supports, and export programs, we have already exhausted what we thought was a generous amount of money to provide the Commodity Credit Corporation. These are all technicalities.

   Mr. KERREY. Now we have a new ``Mr. President'' in the Chair with slightly different agriculture interests but still substantial agriculture interests. So I feel that I am speaking to a kindred spirit. I notify anybody who happens to be watching this on television that the occupant of the Chair is the only person here listening to me other than the pages and the staff. I appreciate very much that he is now looking at me. I appreciate that. 
   Freedom to Farm was supposed to cost $43.5 billion over 7 years. It has cost more than that already. That is before we have an additional payment, which is likely to occur. We have 2 more years to go. I said earlier I am not attacking either Freedom to Farm or those who support it. I understand exactly why it was there. There are many aspects of it that I like a great deal. But I will offer, when it is an appropriate time, two amendments to this appropriations bill that I hope get due consideration by both supporters and opponents of Freedom to Farm. 
   First of all, I will offer an amendment that will reestablish the farmer-owned reserves. I will offer it, as I said, as an amendment to the bill at the appropriate time. The farmer-owned reserve is a proven tool; it works. I will not offer documentation this morning, but I will if the debate becomes a serious debate. It is a tool that will increase market prices; it will decrease expenditures by the Government. History has shown that for feed grains every 100 million bushels removed from the immediate market stream increases prices 3 to 5 cents. Wheat is double that, 8 to 10 cents a bushel. This sets very strict release trigger points based upon existing loan rates, and though critics have said this puts a ceiling on the market price, a market price of $2.78 for corn and $4.12 for wheat looks rather appealing, I argue, both today and in the foreseeable future for any family out there producing either one of those two commodities. 
   Increased market prices, not Government payments, are the most equitable way to provide income to farmers. The farmer-owned reserve is embraced in Nebraska as a commonsense way to help farmers without throwing out Freedom to Farm. The idea originally came to me in testimony that was offered by the Nebraska corn growers at a hearing that was conducted by Congressman BILL BARRETT in Nebraska. 
   The corn growers and the wheat growers have endorsed this idea. They understand that it has worked in the past. It is a way to decrease the payments that are being made by taxpayers and increase the margin of the price the farmers are receiving at the market. I hope when I have an opportunity to offer that amendment we can get by some of the normal ideological fears about the farm program itself and put this reasonable change into law. 
   I also intend to offer an amendment to put the antitrust authority for agriculture on a par with the antitrust authority over other industries; that is, to remove it from Packers and Stockyards and take it under the law over to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. I would love for the jurisdiction to stay at USDA. By it staying at USDA, I retain authority as a result of being on the Agriculture Committee. I am not on the Judiciary Committee. I understand that I am surrendering some jurisdiction when I do that. But the fact is that the USDA will never have the resources to be as aggressive as Justice, and producers, in my view, who want competition, who want the marketplace to work now more than ever, need to know that somebody in Washington, DC, is going to be making certain that that marketplace is, indeed, competitive. 
   The appropriations bill provides no new funding for Packers and Stockyards. Indeed, the recommendation is to provide $2.5 million less than last year's appropriations. I understand that last year's appropriations provided for a one-time revolving GIPSA. I criticize the committee for cutting GIPSA's budget. However, the fact still remains that Packers and Stockyards will have no additional resources next year. 
   In the meantime, the Antitrust Division appropriations in Commerce-State-Justice is $14 million more than we had in 1999. 
   To his credit, the President asked for an additional $600,000 to investigate packer competition. But not to his credit, the President proposed to pay for it with additional user fees, which the committee quite appropriately refused to do. It leaves us with the status quo. What I am hearing from Nebraska producers is, that is not enough. 
   I pause to say that last year during debate in the Agriculture Appropriations Committee, I offered an amendment that would increase competition, that would provide for a change in the law so prices that were offered under contract or formula had to be reported. The distinguished occupant of the Chair, with his great courage, great wisdom, and great leadership, enabled that amendment to be agreed to in the  agriculture appropriations. Unfortunately, it was stuck in the murky process that led to $500 million or $600 million being spent. It was dropped, unfortunately. We will be back to revisit that issue again. 
   This is very much an issue that dovetails with mandatory price reporting. Earlier this year, Americans who went to motion pictures shows, who went to movie theaters to watch a movie, were concerned because in their communities they didn't have access to movies that were nominated for Academy Awards. They feared, quite correctly, that the theater owners were not allowing them to see movies that they wanted to see. There is a concentration of ownership in the theater business. So where did they go? They went to the Antitrust Division of Justice. Guess what. The Antitrust Division of Justice opens an investigation against concentration of ownership, trying to ask the question, Do we have competition in the marketplace, and is the lack of 
   competition having a negative impact upon people who are consuming motion pictures, who go and spend 6 or 8 bucks--whatever it costs--in their local communities to see the movies that they wanted to see? They have the law on their side. People who go to motion picture shows have the law on their side. 
   Our packers are out there saying, my gosh, if the Federal Government is willing to forcefully intervene on behalf of those consumers, why are they not willing to forcefully intervene on our side? 
   We met with Joel Klein. We have met with other agencies of government. They say to us--especially Antitrust--that they simply lack authority. 
   The Federal Trade Commission said the same thing to us--that the only thing we have on our side is the Packers and Stockyards Administration. But Congress constantly underfunds this agency. As a consequence, they have been either unable or unwilling, since this law has been enacted, to file any antitrust action against individuals who are out there in the business. 
   I believe in the American way. I don't want anybody to be prevented from becoming as big and as prosperous as they want. These larger companies, in my view, are organizing for success. They contribute an enormous amount of tax revenue to the Federal Government. They contribute by building jobs. They are doing lots of really good things. 
   But if you are going to have the United States of America be the land of opportunity, you have to have the rules written so that a man or woman who wants to start a small business has a chance to compete and has a chance with an operation with a small amount of resources. They are not going to have anybody lobby the Government. They are not likely to have the money to hire an accountant, or lawyer, or all of the other sorts of people you can hire when you became a larger entity. They are not likely, as a consequence of commanding fewer resources, to be able to survive by pricing their product under their cost for very darned long. As a result, they are vulnerable. 
   That is why we have antitrust laws. The laws are there to protect not just the small businessperson but to protect the United States of America so that we are the land of opportunity. That is where the jobs are created. That is where the innovation occurs. 
   I will offer this amendment transferring authority from Packers and Stockyards, regrettably, because, as I have said, I have jurisdiction over that, being a member of the Agriculture Committee, and I don't like to surrender jurisdiction. But the evidence to me is overwhelming. Consumers have somebody on their side in the Antitrust Division at Justice. Consumers and producers, when it comes to Packers and Stockyards, do not. 
   In conclusion, as I said earlier, when it comes to the agriculture crisis, I intend to work in a bipartisan fashion. 
   I know the distinguished occupant of the Chair is very concerned about what is going on in rural America today. I hope we are able to do much more than just talk. I don't intend to try to command an issue. I prefer to produce results. 
   My hope is that either on this piece of legislation or at some later time we can take action and have the farmers in Nebraska and the farmers in Montana and the farmers in Oklahoma and throughout the country say they believe the Congress understands what is going on in rural America today and is 
   making a concerted effort to finally do something about it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. Madam President, I rise today in support of S. 886, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Chairman HELMS and Senator BIDEN for their leadership in crafting this bipartisan bill. 
   Simply put, the bill before us is a piece of national security legislation. I know we don't often think about the authorization of the State Department in these terms, but the truth is our first line of national defense is diplomacy. We in Congress have spent far too little of our time and resources on ensuring we have a strong, well-financed diplomatic corps. As a consequence we have failed to convince the American public of the importance of our foreign policy institution in maintaining U.S. national security. 
   I recognize that it's much easier to explain to our constituents the importance of the Defense Authorization Bill to their safety and security. The tangible results of the Defense Authorization Bill--a well trained and well-equipped military force--is easily translatable into a sense of greater national security. Rather than tanks and fighter aircraft, this bill authorizes our diplomats and overseas embassies. It authorizes funding for U.S. participation in international organizations and foreign language broadcasting. It is much less obvious to the American people how these types of activities help protect America. Mr. President, they do. 
   One of the most important lessons of the post-Communist era is the increasing importance of diplomacy. A failure of diplomacy in today's world is more likely to result in the need for the use of force. As one thinks about the instances in which the United States has been compelled to use military force in the last decade--from the Persian Gulf to Kosovo--each conflict was preceded by a breakdown of diplomacy, or at least an inability of diplomacy to solve the problem. During the Cold War, we relied on our military might to deter Soviet aggression. Today's threats are more diverse and must be countered, not only with military strength, but with strong intelligence and diplomatic capabilities. 
   I intend to vote for this bill because I believe it is a positive step in strengthening our diplomatic capabilities. To begin, this bill would fully authorize the President's request for Diplomatic and Consular Programs. Just as we strive to have the best-trained and best-equipped military force in the world, we should do everything in our ability to create a diplomatic corps with unparalleled insights into how the world works. A key component of this is creating a State Department that is responsive, efficient, and capable. In my opinion, the integration of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) and the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) into the State Department has improved coordination of U.S. policy and led to greater effectiveness. 
   For our diplomats to be successful, they must be reasonably safe. The bill contains a five-year authorization for a $3 billion program for embassy construction and upgrading U.S. diplomatic facilities overseas. The bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania taught us the painful lesson that too many of our diplomatic posts remain too vulnerable to terrorist attack. We can never guarantee absolute security, but this bill will make an immediate downpayment of $600 million to upgrade security and establish a process to identify those facilities most vulnerable and most in need of improvements. 
   This bill further promotes U.S. national security by authorizing such programs as Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). Each of these are vital tools in our effort to promote democracy and provide hope to those people seeking to end totalitarian rule. The surest way to foster U.S. national security is to extend the benefits of democracy and the rule of law to people in places like Iraq and Cuba. 
   Perhaps the most important component of S. 886 is the authorization to begin repayment of U.S. arrears to the United Nations. It may be surprising to many Americans that, due to our failure to meet our international financial obligations, the United States is perilously close to losing its vote in the General Assembly of the United Nations. Any member country with arrears equal to two years of its annual assessment automatically loses its right to vote in the General Assembly. Our failure to act on this issue by the end of the year will put the United States in such illustrious company as Afghanistan, Iraq, and Yugoslavia--each of which have also lost their voting rights. 
   Some may question the need for U.S. participation in the United Nations. The simple fact is the multilateral nature of the U.N. improves our ability to confront global challenges. Our participation in the United Nations has helped to reduce the threat of Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction program. Our participation in the United Nations has forced Libya to turn over the suspects from the Lockerbie bombing so that they may face justice. Just recently we sought support in the United Nations to strengthen our hand in Kosovo and provide multilateral support for the ongoing peace implementation effort. It's naive to believe that being the largest debtor nation at the U.N. will not have an increasingly negative impact on our ability to lead. Therefore, it is critically important that we pass this bill and set ourselves on the path to paying our debts. 
   There is one group of my constituents that consistently understand the importance of U.S. foreign policy. Nebraska farmers and food processors know maintaining good diplomatic relations is essential to maintaining good markets for their products. They also understand that international conflict and instability can affect not only their prosperity, but their safety as well. I intend to vote for this bill because I believe it will increase the safety of the American people by strengthening our foreign policy institutions and improving our ability to avoid conflict.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Rural Education Initiative introduced by Senator COLLINS today, and I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this important piece of legislation. 
   The Rural Education Initiative takes a significant step toward ensuring that all young people have a shot at the American Dream. It addresses an important problem that many rural schools face: Often they receive small amounts of funding for a variety of programs, but they don't have the budget and personnel to develop and sustain multiple programs. Yet they still have students who need our help to raise their achievement levels and become productive, successful citizens. 
   The Rural Education Initiative asks us to make a $125 million investment in rural schools. And it allows small rural districts to pool funds from a handful of federal programs and target funding in those areas where they see the greatest need and where the funding will have the greatest impact. 
   But this legislation also ensures that districts remain accountable--in exchange for increased flexibility, they must demonstrate improved performance. 
   Over 70 percent of Nebraska's school districts are small, rural districts, as defined by this legislation. Currently Nebraska receives approximately $92 million in federal funds for elementary and secondary education. The Rural Education Initiative would increase that contribution by more than $10 million. 
   Mr. President, recently I contacted Jim Havelka, superintendent of both Dodge and Howells Public Schools in Nebraska. Dodge has 175 students K-12, and Howells has 225 students K-12. I said, ``Jim, what do you need to do a better job of educating your kids?'' 
   Jim said, ``You know, it's awfully hard to start a new initiative on $900. But if I could pool funds from a few programs, I could hire an experienced instructional technology teacher to help us make even better use of computer hardware and software that is so crucial in improving learning opportunities for our students. And I could share that instructor with 2 or 3 other schools. Keep Title I, special education, and other major programs intact, but give me a little flexibility with a few other programs, and I'll give you results.'' 
   Mr. President, I intend to do what I can to help Jim and his students produce results. I believe that in addition to this initiative, we should increase our investment in Title I and in education technology, both of which are especially important to rural schools. I look forward to working with Senator COLLINS and the other cosponsors of this legislation to accomplish these goals as we move this legislation through Congress.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the debate surrounding Y2K Liability is a very important one. The estimated cost associated with Y2K issues vary greatly, ranging from $600 billion to $1.6 trillion worldwide. The amount of litigation that will result from Y2K-related failures is uncertain, but at least one study has guestimated the costs for Y2K related litigation and damages to be at $300 billion. 
   With that in mind, several bills have been drafted which encourage companies to prevent Y2K failures and to remedy problems quickly if they occur, and to deter frivolous lawsuits. It has essentially boiled down to 2 bills: the McCain-Wyden-Dodd bill, and the Kerry bill. Many of the provisions within the bills are the same; however, there are a couple of issues that warrant discussion. 
   I have studied these bills closely. And for me, what it all comes down to is two simple questions: Which bill provides more of an incentive for computer companies to identify and remedy potential Y2K problems? And, second, what effect will this legislation have on consumers? 
   First. Which bill provides more of an incentive for computer companies to identify and remedy potential Y2K problems? To answer that question, one needs to understand what the backers of this bill are so concerned about. The people that are pushing for this bill, namely, some of the computer companies and big business, are not afraid of me. They are not afraid of what Congress might do to them. What they are concerned about, and what they are afraid of, is 12 men and women on a jury. They are afraid of what a jury might do to them if they are sued and their case ends up in court before a jury. 
   Let me be clear: I do think this Y2K liability is a special situation and believe that we should provide computer companies with some type of certainty and protection from these lawsuits. That is why I want to pass one of these bills. However, I think we need to be careful that the protections we provide aren't so great that companies no longer have an incentive to fix their Y2K problems. 
   So, when I hear people asking to ``cap'' the amount of punitive damages that can be imposed against them, I can't help but to wonder, ``Why do you need to worry about that? The only time punitive damages are awarded is if the person has done something flagrantly wrong.'' 
   Similarly, proportionate liability, which provides assurances to the defendant on how much money he would have to pay the plaintiff, is fair and reasonable for most defendants, but  not all defendants. Under the Kerry bill, only good corporate citizens will have the benefit of proportionate liability. Under the McCain bill, all corporate citizens, no matter whether they act in good faith or bad faith, will be rewarded with proportionate liability. 
   Computer companies must have an incentive to identify and remedy potential Y2K problems. If we pass the McCain bill, which both caps punitive damages, and rewards all corporate citizens, both good and bad, with proportionate liability, I believe that would provide a disincentive to remedy potential Y2K problems. 
   Therefore, the answer to the first question is clear: the Kerry bill provides more incentive for computer companies to identify and remedy potential Y2K problems. 
   Second. The second question I had to answer is what effect will this legislation have on consumers? To answer that question, we need to look at one provision in particular: the economic loss provision. The economic loss provision has to do with whether a small business owner or the consumer is allowed to recover for lost profits, lost overhead, and out-of-pocket costs. 
   The McCain bill bars the recovery of economic losses for businesses in all Y2K contexts. The economic loss rule that I support, and the rule followed in most jurisdictions, says that if the parties have agreed by contract about the allocation of loss, then that agreement should govern. If there is no contract, then state law would apply. 
   What does this mean? It means that under the McCain bill, consumers and small businesses are going to be at a disadvantage. To illustrate, let's look at a very practical example that would apply to many small businesses in Nebraska. A businessman wants to open a flower shop. He goes into a computer store and talks to a computer salesman. That salesman tells the businessman that the computer is Y2K compliant and that come January 1, 2000, the computer will be fine. The businessman buys the computer for $5,000. The flower shop opens and is doing great. On January 1, 2000, the computer crashes and can not be fixed for four weeks. The businessman relies on his computer for almost everything, including as a cash register, a client database, and record keeping. As a result of the computer crash, his business is severely affected--he pays bills late, he can't meet payroll, and he loses customers, costing him a total of $75,000. Under the McCain bill, the only damages the businessman can recover are the cost of the computer, $5,000. The economic loss rule I support, the Edwards amendment, would allow the businessman to make a case as to why he should be able to recover at least some of his lost profit. Thus, to answer to the second question, the McCain bill would unfairly place small businesses and consumers at a disadvantage to computer companies. 
   Because of these reasons, I will cast a vote against the McCain Y2K Liability bill. I want to reiterate that I support the goals of this legislation--I want computer companies to have an incentive to identify and remedy potential Y2K problems, and I don't want there to be an onslaught of frivolous lawsuits beginning on January 2, 2000. Unfortunately, I do not believe the McCain bill in its current form is the proper way to address these issues. 
   If these issues are properly addressed in conference, I will support the conference report. Until that happens, although the McCain bill may achieve its goal of eliminating frivolous lawsuits, I believe this comes at too high a price to our small businesses and consumers.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, like many Americans, I am very pleased with the recent agreement within the United Nations Security Council on a plan that will end the conflict in Kosovo and achieve NATO's primary objective of returning the people of Kosovo to their homes. 
   I take this opportunity to join with many others who have spoken on this subject to thank the aircrews and the support personnel of our Air Force, our Navy, and our Marine Corps. These men and women have demonstrated that American airpower can bring change in the course of history. Their dedication to duty and professionalism makes all of us proud. 
   We have just recently passed the defense appropriations bill, and I had hoped to come to the floor, especially to speak to Nebraskans, who have a big stake in this bill, not just because we are beneficiaries of the security provided to us by the men and women who will benefit from these appropriations, but also because we have significant numbers of people in my State who are part of the effort to keep the United States of America safe. 
   These laws that we pass--the defense appropriations bill and the defense authorization bill--are not merely words on a piece of paper; these laws are converted into human action. While it is true that men and women have to be well-trained, they need to be patriotic in order to be willing to give up their freedoms to serve the cause of peace and freedom throughout the world. It is also true that the beginning point is the kind of dream that we have in this Senate and in this Congress about the way we want our Nation and our world to be. 
   Operation Allied Force was very dangerous and very expensive. It is natural for us, at the moment, to want to celebrate a victory. However, I believe we must recognize the hard work is just beginning. 
   Two immense tasks now confront NATO. The first is to restore a refugee people to their homeland, and the second is to make the Balkan region a modern, democratic, and humane environment in which ethnic cleansing can never again occur. The first task may take a year, given the destruction of homes and farms in Kosovo. The second will take generations and will never occur without democratic change in the Yugoslavian Government. 
   At the outset of the NATO military action, I expressed my concern about the effect the U.S. commitment to this operation would have on our ability to meet our global security obligations. Only the United States of America has the ability to counter the threats that are posed by Iraq, North Korea, or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The stability of this planet depends on the readiness of the U.S. military, and thus we must avoid squandering our capabilities on missions not vital to U.S. national security. 
   NATO has committed itself to provide a peace implementation force of 50,000 troops. Of this force, the United States will supply about 7,000 marines and soldiers. While I have concerns about the overcommitment of United States military forces, I am pleased our European allies have stepped forward and pledged to provide the vast majority of the implementation force. We should work to lessen the United States military involvement, with the goal of creating an all-European ground force in Kosovo within a year. 
   In the meantime, we must be straightforward with the 
   American people. There are risks associated with this mission. This force will be responsible for assisting the Kosovar refugees' return home, disarming the Kosovo Liberation Army, and coping with the myriad issues, such as landmines and booby traps, that will be left behind by the departing Serbian military. American casualties remain a very real possibility. 
   Out of this conflict, I see reason for us to be optimistic. First, our allies in Europe, led primarily by Britain and Germany, have played a leading role in finding a solution to the conflict. It is in the interest of the Europeans to build a peaceful and stable Balkans. Their effort to find a diplomatic agreement and to provide the majority of the troops to enforce this agreement is a positive sign for the future. 
   Second, I am pleased with the constructive role that has been played by the Russians. There will not be a lasting Balkan peace without the active participation of Russia. It is my hope the positive atmosphere that has been created between Russia and the West will be carried forward and will reignite the relationship that has suffered over the past few months. 
   Finally, I hope we have begun to see the future of Balkan stability in a larger context. We cannot continue to fight individual Balkan fires. We must begin to look for preventive measures to avoid the next Balkan conflict before it begins. 
   The United States and our European allies have not done enough to bring the Balkans into the political and economic structures of Europe. We have not done enough to support the latent forces of democracy that exist in the region. 
   Our challenge today is to extend to the Balkans the peace and stability that comes from a society based on democratic principles where the rights of all people are protected, a society based on the rule of law where legitimate grievances among people are honestly adjudicated, a society based on free enterprise where commerce is unleashed to create jobs and prosperity. 
   More than failed diplomacy, Kosovo should have taught us the consequences of failed states. Multiethnic Balkan States are not impossible, but to succeed, they must be free-market democracies. 
   I believe peace and stability is an achievable goal. First, we must work with prodemocracy forces within the various Balkan States to strengthen the emerging democracies and encourage the transition to democracy.  
   Second, we must begin a massive reconstruction effort. This project, led by the Europeans, should restore infrastructure damaged in the war, create opportunities for economic development, and establish conditions that will allow for eventual membership in the European Union. 
   Finally, we should convene a conference of concerned nations that will work together to address the long-term security needs of the Balkans. 
   Let me state that the objective of building a peaceful and stable Balkans will not be achieved as long as Slobodan Milosevic remains the President of Yugoslavia. A man who has started four wars in this decade, killed and ethnically cleansed hundreds of thousands of civilians, crushed democratic opposition, and presided over the ruination of his country can never guide the kind of political, economic, and social change that will be necessary to rebuild Serbia. 
   As long as Milosevic remains in power, he is a threat to peace. As long as Milosevic remains in power, the politics of racism and ethnic hatred will prevail. As long as Milosevic remains in power, the West should not prop up his regime by rebuilding Serbia. 
   In 1996, we missed our opportunity to help prodemocracy forces that gathered in the streets of Belgrade. When the protests began, we hesitated, and Milosevic used the opportunity to consolidate his control by brutally repressing the opposition. Rather than seeing Milosevic as a tyrant and a threat to peace, we saw him as a partner in Bosnia. We should no longer suffer the illusion that Milosevic can be a partner in peace. We should work with the people of Serbia to ensure a quick end to the Milosevic regime. 
   I believe the end could be near. Over 70 days of NATO airstrikes have loosened Milosevic's grasp on the instruments he uses to control his people. It is my hope the democratic forces in Serbia--with Western assistance--will seize this opportunity to remove him. Only with a new democratic leadership will Serbia begin the process of rejoining the community of nations. 
   At the end of a military conflict, it is natural to look back and to assess ways in which the use of force could have been avoided. While many will find fault with U.S. diplomacy in the days and months leading up to the initiation of airstrikes, I believe our failure starts a decade before by not working to extend to the Balkans the peaceful democratic revolutions that swept through Eastern Europe. 
   We must address the problems facing the Balkans by extending the benefits of democracy, or face the prospect of continual ethnic conflict and instability. 
   In addition to praising the men and women of the aircrews of the Air Force and the Navy and the Marine Corps who fought and flew bravely into great danger, and who deserve a great deal of credit for delivering this success, I offer as well my congratulations and praise to the Commander in Chief, the President of the United States, who held the NATO alliance together, who persevered when there was considerable doubt and criticism not only at home but abroad as well, and who must be given great credit for delivering this successful agreement. 
   We have just begun the hard work of rebuilding democracy in this region of the world. We should not forget, as I have said in my statement, we have arrived here because we were complacent. We have arrived here because we ignored the call for freedom inside of Serbia, to our eventual peril as a consequence. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the Department of Defense appropriations bill passed this chamber with my support. It is no small feat that a bill encompassing the size and gravity such as our national security can be addressed and passed through the U.S. Senate within the span of two days, with few amendments and little rancorous debate. The lion's share of the credit for this accomplishment goes to the managers of the bill, the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator STEVENS, and the Ranking Member, Senator INOUYE. Through their efforts, they have again done the work which is the first priority of our government: the defense of American independence, lives, and security around the world. 
   When programs have been consistently successful, it is easy to forget that national security and national defense are not a given in the political equation. But, national security doesn't just ``happen.'' We achieve our national security and defense goals because of the men and women honorably serving in our nation's Armed Forces. That security and defense is also achieved because Congress passes laws which authorize Defense programs and appropriate the funds to pay for them. Our contribution to the debate on these bills and our vote on these bills is an essential contribution to our nation's defense. It is our role in government's most solemn responsibility. 
   Given the importance of this responsibility, then, I am encouraged that in this bill as well as in the Defense Authorization, the Senate has responded to the increased strain on our military caused by today's heightened operation tempo. Kosovo adds another requirement to a long list of regions in which U.S. deployment or U.S. commitment is stretching our military forces and supporting intelligence resources to their limit. I have often argued on this floor for allocating our defense and intelligence resources on the basis of threat priorities, and applying the greatest effort to the most dangerous threat. In the same vein, we should avoid overcommitment to places or situations which do not present a direct threat to American independence, lives, or livelihoods. For example, I think it is a mistake to tie up a significant percentage of our Army and Marine combat power in Yugoslav peacekeeping operations long term, and I hope our European allies will take our places there before very long. But wherever those forces are, they must be ready and fully manned, like the air elements of the Air Force, Navy, and Marines who performed so brilliantly over Yugoslavia these last seven weeks. The Defense Appropriations bill supports them. 
   I would now like to take a few minutes to highlight some of the vitally important work that is being accomplished within this appropriations bill. These are provisions which illustrate that we are on the right track in providing for our military and for providing security for people back home in Nebraska, across the United States, and indeed, throughout the world. 
   The backbone of the United States Armed Forces is the men and women who choose to serve their country in our military. From the lowest grade enlisted soldier to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, I salute those who serve out of love for their country. Earlier this year, I was proud to support S. 4, the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines Bill of Rights Act of 1999, which began to address the problems of pay levels, recruitment, and retention facing our military today. S. 4 was a good beginning, most markedly by increasing base pay by 4.8 percent. The appropriations bill is consistent with that 4.8  percent pay increase outlined in S. 4, and I am pleased to have supported this provision which will directly and immediately better the lives of the personnel of our Armed Forces. 
   Another aspect of this appropriations bill which I would like to mention regards an important provision relating to nuclear weapons. During consideration of the Department of Defense Authorization bill for fiscal year 2000, I authored an amendment which would have lifted the restriction on strategic nuclear weapons levels, allowing the U.S. to lower the number of warheads below the START I level. It is my belief that my amendment would not only have increased U.S. security, but would have freed up billions of dollars for other high priority items. The Congressional Budget Office recently conducted a study in which it found we could save between $12.7 billion and $20.9 billion over the next ten years by reducing U.S. nuclear delivery systems within the overall limits of START II. 
   While I would like to thank the 43 of my colleagues who supported my amendment, it unfortunately did not pass. I do not want to return to that debate at this time. However, there is a related program which I have previously supported which also deals with national security and Russian nuclear weapons--the Former Soviet Union Threat Reduction program, otherwise known as Nunn-Lugar. The Nunn-Lugar program provides assistance to states of the former Soviet Union for safeguarding nuclear materials, dismantling missiles and other weapons, and other demilitarization measures. The DoD Appropriations bill funds Nunn-Lugar in the amount of $476 million. Additionally, this bill allocates $25 million of these funds to support the Russian nuclear submarine dismantlement and disposal activities started in FY 1998. This is an important program that in a very concrete and discernable way, increases our security, and I am happy to have supported it. 
   Along with programs of national concern, there are a number of provisions in this bill that directly allow Nebraska and Nebraskans to continue their vital work in safeguarding U.S. national security. 
   Offutt Air Force Base, located in Bellevue, Nebraska, is responsible for a number of missions which are particularly noteworthy. Offutt, with over 10,000 military and civilian 
   personnel, is home to the United States Strategic Command, the joint command charged with deterring nuclear attacks on our country. There are many threats out there, but only one of them, Russian nuclear weapons, is capable of ending our national life. STRATCOM's mission may not be in the news that often, but it the most essential of all defense missions, and it is commanded from Nebraska. 
   Offutt Air Force Base also hosts the U.S. Air Force's premiere reconnaissance and command-and-control unit, the 55th Wing, the largest wing within the Air Force's Air Combat Command. The Fighting 55th's aircraft provide global situational awareness to military leaders and government officials. It is by now commonplace to say that we live in the Information Age. Information has become a precious commodity which often can mean the difference between success and defeat. The missions that Offutt specializes in focus on gathering this kind of critical information. In a variety of ways, Offutt's missions keep us more informed, more aware, and more safe. Here are some specifics on the various programs. 
   The 55th's workhorse aircraft is the RC-135, also known as Rivet Joint. The RC-135 mission conducts electronic reconnaissance, providing direct, near real-time information and electronic warfare support to theater commanders and combat forces monitoring. Rivet Joint has played an important role in a number of recent military missions, including Kosovo, Bosnia, and Iraq. Information gathered by the RC-135 is made available to theater commanders, the Department of Defense and National Command Authorities. Data is processed, analyzed and stored by Air Combat Command, the Air Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency. I am pleased that the bill passed yesterday appropriates $220.4 million for the refurbishing and upgrading of these important aircraft. Reengining these aircraft is a particularly important improvement. 
   The WC-135 fulfills an air sampling mission in support of the Air Force Technical Applications Center at Patrick AFB, Florida, by verifying compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. It gathers information on nuclear tests and conducts baseline air sampling. By collecting particles in the air during flight, the WC-135 is able to detect if and when nuclear tests are conducted or if a nuclear bomb is detonated, even from thousands of miles away. Considering the nuclear weapons testing last year of both India and Pakistan, it is clear that the WC-135 has not outlived its usefulness. The WC-135 is the only aircraft throughout the U.S. Air Force conducting this vital mission, and we in Nebraska are fortunate to have it based at home at Offutt Air Force Base. 
   The OC-135, or Open Skies, is tasked to complete photo reconnaissance fly-overs. This mission supports the Defense Threat Reduction Agency by conducting observation flights in accord with the Open Skies Treaty. This treaty will allow the OC-135 to fly over Russian air space to monitor weapons reductions treaties. Although the Open Skies Treaty has not yet been ratified by all parties, the OC-135 has not been dormant. While the Open Skies Treaty awaits ratification, the OC-135 is heavily involved in additional photo reconnaissance projects, including missions such as weather observations of Hurricane Mitch. The Open Skies mission is fully funded through fiscal year 2004. 
   Additionally, E-4B aircraft also stationed at Offutt provide transport and command and control for the President, the Secretary of Defense, and Secretary of State. Much more than simply a transport aircraft, the E-4B allows senior officials complete access to critical information and communications in a secure fashion, keeping the President and others ``in the loop,'' even while in mid-flight. 
   Along with Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska continues to make important contributions to our national security through components of the National Guard and the Reserves. Most recently, these components have played important roles in Kosovo alongside their active component counterparts. 
   The 155th Wing of the Nebraska Air National Guard has been very active during the Kosovo mission, flying KC-135s--fuel tanker planes--above and around Kosovo. These KC-135s perform the remarkable task of mid-air refueling for a variety of aircraft, including the B-52 Stratofortress and the E6. Indeed, over the last several months, the Nebraska unit led the KC-135 refueling effort, involving hundreds of aircraft, and also was the last volunteer unit engaged in the region before the reserve call-up was instituted. This has all been done, even though the 155th Wing is the smallest of all the Air Guard wings across the country. I applaud their efforts and their successes. 
   As well, the Nebraska Army National Guard is currently serving in a nine-month deployment in Bosnia as part of the NATO peace-keeping forces. The 24th Medical Company is working alongside Guard units from across the country to transport patients from the field to hospitals. At a time when a robust economy and opportunities in the private sector can pull people away from public service, I salute these men and women who continue to make sacrifices so that we may be safe. 
   The examples I have given here of the hard work being done by our Armed Forces are not the exception, but the rule. In a time of tight budgets and increased missions, I am proud to say that our Armed Forces are second to none around the globe. Even when we continue to ask more of our military men and women, they always rise to the challenge. We must never forget the risks they take for our sake and the freedoms they forego, and we must provide them the best support, conditions, equipment, and training possible in return. I am proud to have supported passage of the defense appropriations bill yesterday, and I hope and expect that we will continue the strong support of those who are willing to sacrifice all for the cause of your freedom and mine, the men and women of our Armed Forces.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise unfortunately to speak in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from Florida, Senator GRAHAM.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the Senator from Florida has identified a very serious potential problem, which is that we have now, in the aftermath of the report that was produced and made public by Congressman COX and Congressman DICKS, a great deal of interest in doing something, to take some action to look like we are solving the problem. 
   What I understand the Senator from Florida to be saying is we should take a collective deep breath, and I quite agree with him. Because I think not only is it possible, it is likely, if we are not careful, we will, in our actions, do things that will make the country less safe, not more safe and secure. 
   Perhaps the most important thing to be saying about the Cox and the Dicks report is that there is a lot less there than meets the eye. By that, I don't mean to say I am critical of the report, although there are three or four conclusions they reach with which I do not agree, that I do not think are supported by the classified report they have filed. I see in the Cox-Dicks report--and in fact in their own evaluation they say: This was not a comprehensive study; there were a lot of things we were not able to check out. 
   I believe that is essentially what the Senator from Florida is saying. There is still a lot that neither the Cox-Dicks committee, the Temporary Special Committee, nor the House and the Senate Select Committees on Intelligence, have examined. Indeed, one of the people we asked to do an evaluation of the damage, Admiral Jeremiah, has said in the report he gave to us it is terribly important that we do a net assessment; we try to establish what the gains were, what the losses were, before we move on. 
   I am just not persuaded, I say to my friend from Florida, that this commission he is proposing--that would be essentially similar to the Brown-Aspin Commission; I think it is modeled after that commission--is the right way to do it.  
   I propose as an alternative, No. 1, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence try to come up with a scope of study similar to the Jeremiah study, try to put it in the intelligence authorization bill, but, in other words, challenge our committee to do something similar to what we did with Admiral Jeremiah. He started to do a damage assessment for us. 
   I think much more needs to be done before the Congress knows for certain, A, what the damage was and, B, for certain what exactly it is we ought to do. 
   I know the majority leader has, and I am cosponsoring with him, some changes he is recommending that we will be recommending to be made. But these are pretty limited. Many of these things can be done administratively. They really are just based upon what we know right now. So, while I find myself unpersuaded by this amendment--although maybe with a little bit more time I could have been persuaded--I am not persuaded we need a commission of this kind. I am persuaded we do need further examination, in fact a more thorough examination, than done to date. 
   The damage has been done. So we make certain in our response to this story of espionage and story of lax security, not just at the Labs but in monitoring and watching the satellites that were being launched in the Chinese Long March program, and the whole export regime we have established to make certain we do not export things that are then used against us in some fashion, that we do not presume, in short, that we know everything that happened and we do not take action that could 
   make the problem worse. 
   I believe what the Senator from Florida is suggesting to us is right on target. We have to be very careful that we do not rush to judgment and do things that will make things worse. So I recommend an alternative that I think will enable us to accomplish the same objective. 
   Again, I have great respect for the Senator from Florida and what he is trying to do. I think I vote with him 9 out of 10 times and do not like to be in a position where I am opposing his amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KERREY. I answer emphatically yes. It needs to be Governmentwide. Indeed, I would say to the Senator, as he no doubt knows, there is also vulnerability with contractors, current and former employees. There is a significant amount of vulnerability. 
   Let me point out in the case of the transfer of these designs that have been reported to the public, we are not 100 percent certain that they were transferred out of Los Alamos. That is the problem. This design was held by many other people other than Los Alamos. So that is one of the problems here. When you take this particular situation, if you are 100 percent certain it is Los Alamos, tighten up security at the Lab. If you are not 100 percent certain and we tighten up security in the Lab, we may be tightening up security in a place that is not the problem. 
   So I think there is reason to believe the changes that have been suggested thus far will not damage us. But I think what the Senator is saying is exactly right. It needs to be Governmentwide. It needs to look at the contractors. 
   Another thing I think needs to be considered, there was an op-ed piece written by Edward Teller, published in the New York Times. Mr. Teller can best be described as somebody whose lifetime has been devoted to the task of making certain the United States of America has a robust nuclear deterrent and that nuclear deterrent was adequate to protect the people of the United States of America and our interests. 
   Mr. Teller says, and I agree with him, by the way, by the time you put all other security measures in place, the most important deterrent against losing our technological superiority is not defensive measures but making certain we allocate enough for research and development and we keep the pointy edge of our technological spear sharp. So long as we continue in research and development, not just in design but construction and deployment, Mr. Teller is saying you decrease the possibility that espionage or some other transfers--in some cases transfers you do not even think about--will do damage to the security of the United States of America.

   Mr. KERREY. Yes, I do. I have to answer the first part of the Senator's question no. I do not think we are in any danger of following Adolf Hitler's example, but I do think we need to be careful that in an effort to restrict who gets to know things we do not create an additional security problem. 
   We have had many examples, as we try to figure out what goes wrong with a national security decision, especially intelligence, where we discover that the problem was Jim knew it; Mary didn't know it. Neither one of them had a right or need to know what each other was doing. As a consequence of them simply walking from one cubicle to the other talking, a mistake is made. 
   We have to be very careful in exercising our judgment in what ought to be done in tightening things that we do not actually create additional security problems.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, today, I join with my colleagues to introduce the Yankton Sioux Tribe and the Santee Sioux Tribe of Nebraska Development Trust Fund Act. This legislation will provide compensation to the Yankton and Santee Sioux Tribes for  damages incurred by the development of the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin program. 
   As a result of the construction of Pick-Sloan development projects on tribally-held land adjacent to the Missouri river, Tribes were subjected to forced land takings, involuntary resettlement of families, and the loss of irreplaceable reservation resources. 
   The Santee Sioux Tribe of Nebraska lost approximately 600 acres of Indian land located near the Santee village and an additional 400 acres on the Nebraska Island of the Santee Sioux Tribe Indian Reservation. 
   Congress provided compensation to other Native American Tribes for losses caused by the Pick-Sloan projects. However, the Yankton and the Santee Sioux Tribes were not provided opportunities to receive compensation by Congress. Instead, they received settlements for the appraised value of their property through condemnation proceedings in U.S. District Court. But these Tribes did not receive rehabilitation compensation. As a result, the Yankton and Santee Sioux Tribes are entitled to this additional compensation. 
   This legislation seeks to utilize revenues from the sale of hydropower generated by the Pick-Sloan dams to redress tribal claims for land takings. Congress has endorsed this approach on three separate occasions by enacting legislation which established compensation for several other Tribes adversely impacted by the Pick-Sloan projects. 
   We propose to establish trust funds for the Yankton and Santee Sioux Tribes from a portion of the revenues of hydropower sales made by the Western Areas Power Administration. More specifically, the Santee Sioux Tribe of Nebraska would received a yearly payment of interest earned on the principal in the trust fund. Our legislation encourages the Santee Sioux Tribe to craft an economic development plan for use of the interest income. This self-governance approach will enable the Santee Sioux Tribe to continue to address improving the quality of life of its tribal members. 
   This legislation values the importance of redressing tribal claims and self-governance for Nebraska Native American Tribes. It will enable the Santee Sioux Tribe of Nebraska to address past grievances and look forward to investing in its future.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, first of all, let me say that this piece of legislation being considered right now, in my view, of all the laws we write and all the laws we consider, is the one that is most vital. If we do not have a defense that is able to defend not just the United States of America but our interests, all the rest of it is secondary, in my view. 
   I am very impressed--I came to this Senate in 1989, and I came to the Senate without the experience of having gone to law school. I was trained in other matters. The longer I am here, the more impressed I am both with the law itself and the power of this law. I cannot help but, as I begin to describe my own amendment, take a little bit of time to describe the connection between the law and things people see in their lives that they may not see as having been caused by the law itself. 
   We do not have an Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps without this piece of legislation, which is, I think--I don't know--500-and-some pages long, with a report with it as well. This law creates our military. It authorizes appropriations to be made. It authorizes us to go out and recruit people to serve in our Armed Forces. 
   We are going into the Memorial Day weekend during which I guess many, if not most, of us are going to be called upon to comment upon the meaning of Memorial Day--what does this day mean to us in our lives. 
   For me, it is a time to reflect and say that these 1,360,000 men and women who are currently serving our Nation, and the half million Reserve and Guard men and women who are out there as well, are part of a long tradition of American men and women who have given up their freedom, because in the military they have a different code than we have in the private sector. The standards of justice are different. The expectations are different. 
   In the military, the command structure is such that if I have command--which I did many, many years ago--if I have command and do well, I get a medal. But if I do poorly, my fitness report will be so bad I will be looking for a private sector opportunity. We have a responsibility we cannot delegate. That imposes upon an individual who is in the military real burdens that are different from what we have in the private sector--real responsibilities that are completely different. 
   A man or woman who serves us today, who serves the cause of freedom today in our Armed Forces, does something that is much different from most private sector citizens. I begin my comments on this amendment by saluting them, by thanking them for taking what, unfortunately, today is almost a nonmainstream action, and that is based upon their love of country and their love of freedom, saying: We're willing to sacrifice our freedom; we're willing to give up rights that most private sector citizens have. 
   Furthermore, nobody should doubt that in normal training operations it is possible to be injured or to even lose your life. A lot of these training operations are dangerous. So they are risking their lives on a day-to-day basis. Obviously, they are involved today in Kosovo; they are involved in the Balkans; they are involved with containing Saddam Hussein; they are involved on the Korean peninsula; they are forward deployed in areas around the world where we have interests, not just interests that are only of the United States, but interests in values that we hope will spread worldwide. 
   All of us had the opportunity--I did; I took advantage of the opportunity--to sit and listen to Presidents Kim Dae-jung of South Korea and Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic and Nelson Mandela of South Africa when each spoke at a joint session of Congress across the way in the House of Representatives, and looked down to every representative of the people and said: Thank you, American people. You put your lives on the line, and we are free in South Korea today as a consequence. You put your lives and resources on the line, and we are free in the Czech Republic because of it. You have put your lives and resources on the line in South Africa, and we are free there as well. Your efforts enabled us to be free, these three individuals said. Many others have said the same thing. 
   It is not a cliche that freedom is not free. This piece of legislation, this important piece of legislation, has us supporting 1,360,000 men and women in the military, and half a million Reserve and Guard people who are actively involved in the cause of defending freedom in the United States of America and throughout the world. This is an extremely important piece of legislation. I argue if we don't get this one right, all the rest of it is secondary. If this piece of legislation, if this law is not written correctly, all the rest of it doesn't matter. 
   I begin my comments this morning praising Chairman WARNER and the ranking member, Senator LEVIN, who have led the Armed Services Committee to give us this piece of legislation. They understand this piece of legislation keeps America safe. This is about security. We can't cut corners. We can't scrimp. We can't say we will just go partially there. We have to answer the question: What do we need to do to keep the people of the United States safe? How do we keep them secure and try to write laws that accomplish that objective? 
   With great respect to the committee, there is one provision in subtitle D called ``Other Matters'' on page 357 that I am proposing to strike. That language provides a 1-year extension of a requirement that I think causes the United States of America to be less safe than it would without this provision. Let me get to it specifically. 
   What this provision does is say that the United States of America must maintain a nuclear deterrent that is at the START I levels, that we have to have warheads deployed, land, sea, air, that are at START I levels; that the President of the United States cannot go below those START I levels. In the cold war, perhaps even a few years after the cold war was ended, when we were trying to err on the side of safety, this made sense because the No. 1 threat then was a bolt out of the blue, an attack by the Soviet Union that might occur when we least expected it. We had to maintain an active deterrence and prevent that. The capacity to survive that bolt-out-of-the-blue 
   attack and counterattack was an essential part of our strategy. 
   Today, the No. 1 threat is not a bolt-out-of-the-blue attack. The No. 1 threat today is an accidental launch, a rogue nation launch, or a sabotage launch of a nuclear weapon. One of the things that causes me a great deal of concern in this new era of ours is that I think we in Congress and the American people as well have forgotten the danger of these nuclear weapons. We have been talking about new threats to America. We have a threat in the form of chemical weapons, a threat in the form of biological weapons, a threat in the form of cyber warfare, lots of others things like that, terrorism, that cause people to be very much concerned. 
   My belief is that the only threat out there that can kill every single American, and thus the threat that ought to be top on our list of concerns is nuclear weapons. The nation that possesses the  greatest threat of all in terms of an accidental launch, a rogue nation launch, or a sabotage launch is Russia. 
   I appreciate the fine work that Congressman COX and Congressman DICKS did. They presented a report yesterday. I think they have laid out a roadmap that will enable us to change our laws and increase security at the Labs, increase the security of the satellite launches and increase the security, in general, with the transfer of technology through export licenses. I think they gave us a good roadmap, but one of the concerns I have with the report--I think it is unintentional--strike ``I think.'' It is unintentional--it has left the impression that China is a bigger threat to the United States in terms of nuclear weapons than Russia is. Nothing can be further from the truth. 
   In China, they prevent the possibility of an accidental launch by saying we are not going to put our warheads on the missile. According to published reports, it would take at least 24 hours and probably a minimum of 48 hours, from the moment an order was given to launch, to put the warheads on the missiles. In China they have no more, according to published reports, than 13 weapons headed in our direction. They are categorized as city busters. They are not as accurate as the Russians are. They are not as deadly as the Russians are. They are not as likely, as a consequence of organized systems, to be launched in an accidental fashion. Even though they can reach us, even though China is a serious threat as a consequence of their behavior in the proliferation area--and we should not have trimmed in areas of export licenses or satellite launches on Long March or the operations of our Laboratories or other areas that would put America at risk--the threat assessment today says that the No. 1 threat to us is the threat that is posed by Russia as a consequence of their having strategic weapons that could reach the United States in a matter of hours and could reach the United States in a devastating fashion not through intentional launch but accidental launch, rogue nation launch or sabotage launch. 
   I think that part of the problem in all of this is, again, that we have been lulled into a false sense of security that, well, maybe these nuclear weapons aren't that big of a problem. Let me say that in the former Soviet Union, that may have been the case, because their economy was much stronger than it is today. They had a much greater capacity to control those weapons systems that they have. 
   One of the reasons, the biggest reason that I want to change this is that I believe we are forcing Russia today 
   to maintain a level of nuclear weapons beyond what their financial system will allow them to maintain. They are currently required at START I levels to have 6,000 strategic warheads. Again, according to published accounts from their own military people, they would prefer to be at a level of 1,000 or lower, because they simply don't have the resources. I can go into some rather startling problems that are created as a consequence of that inability, but they simply don't have the ability, the resources to allocate to maintain those 6,000 warheads as we do. Ours are safe. Ours are secure. We have redundant switching systems and all kinds of other protections to make certain that we don't have an accidental launch, to make certain that there is no rogue transfer, to make certain that there is no terrorism that could take over one of these sites and be used either against the United States itself or against some other country. 
   One of the baseline problems that we have as Americans is that we are the most open society on earth. We are the most successful society measured by our economy, measured by our military, measured by even our democracy, which can be a bit frustrating from time to time. We take sides on issues worldwide, which I think we have to do if we want to continue to fight for the freedom of people throughout this world. But as a consequence of all those things, there are lots of people on this Earth who hate Americans, who have in their hearts a desire to do significant damage to us. It is a problem created from our own success. So as we try to decide how we are going to keep our country safe, one of the things that I believe we need to think about when it comes to Russia is, is it possible for somebody who hates America, who is willing to do damage to America and willing to die in the act of doing it--what kind of risk is there as a consequence of a policy under law that requires Russia to maintain a nuclear force that is higher than either they can afford or they want to maintain? 
   Well, I will describe a couple of scenarios in length here, but many years ago, sort of a Stone Age time for me, I was trained in the U.S. Navy SEAL team. I do not argue that I was an exemplary special operations person. I had a relatively short experience in the war before I was injured, so I didn't have enough time on task to become really good at it. But you always have these sort of imaginary fantasies that you are still 25 years of age, and there are times when you sort of think that way. 
   I believe it is possible for somebody who is well trained and well organized to raid a silo site of a Russian missile in the Russian wilderness and take that site over. You will have a scenario on the opposite side that says that it can't be done. I believe it can be done. 
   One of the things that you have to do when you are planning, writing a law to defend the people of the United States of America, is you have to think about that small possibility and you have to plan for it. We didn't expect that the Russians were high probability going to come through the Fulda Gap during the 40-plus years of the cold war, but we defended against it, and it was an expensive defense because it was possible that it could happen. 
   Mr. President, I believe it is possible for a small band of discontents or terrorists to raid a silo site of a Russian missile in the Russian wilderness. I believe that there are soldiers today in Russia who are poorly trained, who are 
   sparsely equipped, and who are irate at not having been paid in well over a year in some cases. I think they are vulnerable and easily overtaken, and as a consequence, willing to cooperate in things that would put the United States of America at risk. 
   What you have to do is sort of then say to yourself: What would happen? Imagine what would happen if that were to occur. 
   Well, I again have to underscore with a story why I think we are lulled to sleep by nuclear weapons. In the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, on which I have the honor of serving as a result of Senator DASCHLE appointing me to that and serving on behalf of the Senate, I once asked some analysts of the CIA to tell me what the impact would be of a single missile being launched and hitting a U.S. city. The answer was we are really not sure. We haven't thought it through lately. We don't put it up on our radar screen as being the sort of thing to worry about. 
   I find that not only alarming but illustrative of the general problem. We are not thinking about this threat. 
   We are not imagining what could happen in a worse case scenario and, as a consequence, we are sort of allowing ourselves to be dragged along with yesterday's policy, not thinking about how we can do this differently to substantially reduce the threat to the people of the United States of America, and I believe, by the way, in the process, freeing up resources that could be used on the conventional side where there is much more likely scenarios where American men and women are going to be called on to defend the cause of freedom and fight for the cause of freedom. 
   A single Russian rocket could be launched over the top of the world from the north, and it would go across the Arctic pole, and in less than an hour it could be in over Chicago. On a bad day, it might come within 100 yards of its target. On a good day, it would probably come within 10 to 15 yards of its target. I am talking about something about which, again, people will say this is alarmist. 
   It is not an alarmist scenario. This is what nuclear weapons do. We have sort of forgotten that, in my view. Back in the 80s, during the cold war, all of us understood the danger of nuclear weapons, but today I don't think we do. I think we have forgotten what kind of damage they can do. 
   A single nuclear weapon would vaporize everything. The surrounding air is instantaneously heated to a temperature of 10 million degrees Celsius. It  looks brighter than the sun and shoots outward at a few hundred kilometers per second. It would be sufficient to set fire to anything in Chicago that is combustible at a distance of 14 kilometers. Anybody within 80 kilometers would be blinded as a consequence of the blast. 
   After the fireball, the blast effect force follows, 
   traveling out from ground zero. Those within 3 kilometers, who had not already been killed, will die from the percussive force. At 8 kilometers, 50 percent of the people will be killed, and every building within 2 kilometers will be completely destroyed. Major destruction of homes, factories, and office buildings would extend out to 14 kilometers. 
   In the farthest reaches of the immediate blast zone--encompassing everything in Chicago--structures would be severely damaged, and 15 percent of the people in Chicago would be dead, 50 percent would be injured, and most survivors would suffer second- and third-degree burns. 
   This is the damage that would be done from a single Russian nuclear weapon exploded above an American city. This is just one city. 
   Again, I point this out not to be alarmist but to say that this is a real threat. This is not an imaginary threat. This weapons system exists. There are 6,000 of these in Russia today that were needed in the cold war; they were needed in a deterrent strategy that the Russians had developed. We have drawn down, and they have drawn down to the 6,000 level--a bit higher than that still today. They are drawing down to that 6,000 level. 
   But, again, if you ask either our intelligence or the Russians directly, they will tell you they don't have the resources to maintain even 1,000. They don't have the resources to maintain 1,000, let alone 6,000-plus, and in the kind of secure environment the people of the United States of America will need in order for themselves to be safe and secure as a consequence. 
   I tell the story out of what I think is a loss of focus on the danger of nuclear weapons. I am very concerned that the American people have been lulled into a false sense of security as a consequence of our elected leaders repeatedly telling them the threat no longer exists. In the Presidential campaign of 1996, the President correctly kept saying that for the first time in the history of the Nation we are not targeting the Russians and they are not targeting us. 
   Well, you can retarget in a couple of minutes, max. This retargeting task is a fairly simple task. Critics of the President pointed that out, and I think correctly. It caused people to be sort of lulled into a sense that, gee, this wasn't a problem. If we are not targeting them and they are not targeting us, this is great news, so we don't have to worry about this threat any longer; thus, we can sort of stop worrying about nuclear weapons. We can worry about other threats that we have to the United States. 
   Again, I am calling my colleagues' attention to this problem not because I believe there is going to be a deliberate nuclear attack from Russia, because I don't think that is likely, or even plausible. Indeed, Russia has made extraordinary progress in their effort to transform their economy and political system. Though they have a long way to go to complete the transition, they need to be applauded for it. But this transition is going to take decades--back, forward, stop, go. It is going to take a fair amount of time to transition from an old command economy to a market economy. In the meantime, they are finding it increasingly difficult to maintain the military infrastructure they inherited from the collapse of the Soviet Union, including, dare I say, their stockpile of thousands of nuclear weapons--estimated to be 
   close to 7,000 on the strategic side and a comparable amount on the tactical side. There are 14 storage facilities, according to published reports, where they store fissile material. We don't know what is going on inside those buildings. It is a serious problem that our former colleague, Sam Nunn, has said is a threat not coming from Russia's might but from its military weakness. 
   If a single one doesn't bother you, there was an incident that occurred recently on September 11, 1998. I appreciate that some will say that KERREY is dreaming, this isn't a real danger. I don't think there is a greater danger than an accidental launch of a nuclear weapon at the United States of America. I think it is the most dangerous problem we face, and it is a scenario that could happen. If it happens, I believe we are going to regret not having developed a different strategy than the old arms control strategy that we have had in the past. I am not going to describe an alternative strategy. I think one is needed, and I think one is more likely to occur if we strike this language from the defense authorization bill and allow the President to go below 6,000, similar to what President Bush did in the early 1990s, getting a reciprocal response from Russia as a consequence. 
   Let me describe a real time scenario, a situation that happened on the 11th of September--does the Senator want to say something?

<TEXT>
   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, let me describe an event that occurred on September 11, 1998. Maybe colleagues didn't notice it; it was written up with a fairly small amount of attention. There was an 18-year-old Russian sailor who seized control of a Russian nuclear submarine near Murmansk. He killed seven fellow crewmembers and held control of the submarine for 20 hours. Russian authorities say that there were no nuclear weapons aboard the submarine. But it would not be difficult to imagine a scenario in which a similarly distraught member of the Russian navy might choose to express his frustration by seizing control of a submarine loaded with long-range, nuclear-tipped missiles. It is widely recognized that command and control of weapons on Russian submarines is much more problematic than even with their ground-based forces. 
   There was a recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine, which conducted an analysis of the effects of an unauthorized launch against the United States from a--and I emphasize just one--Russian Delta IV submarine. This submarine is capable of carrying 16 SS-N-23 missiles. Each of these missiles is equipped with four 100-kiloton warheads. The study examined the consequences of 48 warheads being detonated over eight major U.S. cities. It is likely that this scenario 
   may not be right. It is likely that they would say we have 64 warheads and will put one in each State in the United States of America--that leaves me 14 more--and they will put a couple in New York, a couple in Florida, a couple in other States. Imagine 64,000 kiloton weapons being detonated within a couple of hours in the United States. That is a scenario that could be very real. 
   Is such a scenario likely to happen? It is less likely to happen than the sun coming up tomorrow, but it could happen. It is a scenario that we need to think about as we think about the danger of these nuclear weapons. And because we don't think about them, it is not likely that we will consider an amendment like this terribly important. We will sort of drift along, as I think we are doing now, saying we are going to wait for the Duma to ratify START II. They are threatening not to ratify for every possible reason. I don't know what the next anger point is going to be. I personally don't believe that the ratification of START II by the Duma is necessarily terribly important. 
   That we need to look for an alternative way to reduce these threats, to me, is painfully obvious if you examine the danger that this threat poses to us. 
   When you think about the danger of an accidental or a rogue nation or a  sabotage launch, I think you come immediately to the conclusion that, my gosh, we have far more than we need to keep America safe, and the Russians clearly have far more than they need not only to keep their country safe but to reduce this risk of accidental launch. They do not control their weapons in the same way that we do. They don't have the capacity to control them in the same way that we do, as well. 
   Imagine, I ask my colleagues; put it on your radar screen. You have a Delta IV submarine with 64 100-kiloton weapons that could be in the United States in 2 hours. They are not like the Chinese nuclear weapons. The Chinese nuclear weapons take several days to get together. Again, part of the published reports is that they have 13 or so aimed at the United States--aimed at our cities. They are nowhere near as accurate as the Russians, or as deadly as the Russians, and nowhere near as likely to be launched either through an accidental launch or through an organized effort to come through sabotage and take over a single facility, or to take over one of these submarines that are much more at risk as a consequence of their lax security. 
   If you do not think the scenario is possible, I would like to quote the words of former a Russian Navy captain following this particular incident with the Russian sailor that I described earlier on the 11th of September 1998. He said, ``It is really scary that one day the use of nuclear arms may depend on the sentiments of someone who is feeling blue, who has gotten 
   out of bed on the wrong side and who does not feel like living.'' The probability of this today is higher than ever before. 
   The news has been filled recently with stories regarding nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, the stories have been causing us to be concerned about our security relative to the Nation of China. The findings that China, over the past 20 years, has methodically stolen U.S. nuclear secrets from our National Laboratories are very disturbing, to put it mildly. We were very lax in our security in our Laboratories. We are very lax in our security with our export control licenses. We are very lax in our security in monitoring satellites that are being launched on the Long March system of the Chinese, and as a consequence, the United States of America suffers. There is no question that is true. But U.S. security has suffered against a nation with considerably less capability than Russia and considerably less risk of an accidental launch as a result of the way the two nations organize their weapon systems. 
   In the uproar surrounding this story, I fear that we may be losing touch with reality concerning the size of the threat we face in China relative to the far greater Russian nuclear threat. Press accounts indicate that China may have no more than 20 land-based nuclear missiles capable of reaching the United States. 
   Also, again, according to the media, as I said, Chinese nuclear weapons aren't kept on continual alert. Their nuclear warheads and liquid fuel tanks are stored separate from their missiles. Again, it would take them a considerable amount of time to fuel, to arm, and to launch these weapons. That just one of these weapons would cause immense pain and devastation to the United States of America ought to be obvious. But, again, it is a much smaller threat than the threat of an accidental rogue nation, or a sabotage takeover of a Russian site that could be launched with a devastating impact against the United States of America and would put our people at considerable risk. 
   As of January 1999, my colleagues, with reference to this issue--I remember campaigning for the Senate in 1988. In 1988, you had to know all of this stuff. You had to know all of these in numbers, because arms control advocates were asking you, and opponents of arms control were asking. The freeze was going on. The MX missile was being debated. It was a hot issue in 1988. 
   In 1999, it is not a hot issue. It is not on the radar screen. You have to hunt around to find someone who cares about it and asks you about it and express a concern about what I, again, consider to be the most dangerous threat to the people of the United States of America. 
   I repeat that this is the only threat that could kill every single American. Just a single Delta IV submarine that I talked about earlier--you put 64 100-kiloton weapons on top of 64 sites in the United States of America, and you are no longer the strongest economy on Earth. 
   We would have considerably more, to put it mildly, than 4.2 percent unemployment. We would not be screaming along with an economic recovery. The stock market would react, I would hazard a guess, rather adversely to that piece of news. There would be devastation and destruction and considerable loss of life, and the United States of America would be set back a considerable amount of time. We would not be as safe and as secure as we once were, and the world, as consequence, would suffer the loss of our leadership. 
   A single Delta IV submarine owned by the Russians in a very insecure environment, in my judgment, would set the U.S. back considerably. 
   I keep citing it only because I believe that we have taken nuclear weapons, unfortunately, off our radar screen, and we don't think about this much. I say to the distinguished chairman and to the ranking member, Senator LEVIN, and Senator SMITH, who is the chairman of the Strategic Subcommittee, that I know each of you are very concerned about this. I am talking about the general population. I would hazard a guess that if one of these news media outlets that does polls all the time did a poll and asked the question about whether the Chinese nuclear threat is a greater threat to the United States of America than the Russian nuclear threat, it is likely to be that a large number of the people would say yes, given what they have heard recently in the news. 
   China may evolve into a serious military threat to the United States in the future. They are unquestionably a proliferator of weapons, and all of us should be dismayed and angry at the lax security that we have discovered through the Cox report and other reports over the last 20 years, and should move with legislation and action to tighten up and make sure that we reduce that threat. But the Chinese threat is nowhere near the danger that the Russian nuclear threat poses to the people of the United States of America. 
   What I am attempting to do with this amendment by striking the floor that we have imposed for 3 years in a row in the defense authorization bill--this provision that prohibits the United States from going below START I force levels until START II enters into force--is that I am suggesting that this floor increases the threat to the United States of America because we are waiting for the Russian Duma to ratify START II. We are still, in my view, in the old way of thinking about how to deal with nuclear weapons and how to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons and keep the people of the United States of America safe. 
   Let me provide a little bit of history of arms control. 
   Again, the chairman of the committee asked for some time to respond. Earlier, I was asked if I was going to wrap this thing up at 11:45. I say to my friend from Virginia that I had much more to say on this matter, and it may be that I am not able to agree to a time agreement and have the vote at 11:45. I would like to be able to do that. Maybe what I should try to do is abbreviate my comments and give the chairman a chance to respond briefly, if he chooses to do so. 
   I see the chairman of the subcommittee is here. He may have some opposing points of view that he would like to offer. I want to give him a chance to do that. I think it is highly unlikely that I will be able to agree to a vote immediately after the BRAC vote at 11:45.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, again I am not trying to make an argument here for or against strategic defense. I will work with Senator COCHRAN to try to fashion some assistance to bring additional Democrats. I supported what Senator COCHRAN was trying to do. 
   The problem is, missile defense is not prepared today. The problem is, we don't have missile defense today. We are not sure when we will have it. I don't want to get into necessarily arguing that. I am saying that within a matter of hours it is possible for the United States of America to suffer an attack the likes of which I think very few people are imagining. 
   It is a real threat. It is not an imaginary threat. It is a real threat, and it is a threat that is getting larger, not a threat that is getting smaller. It is not the old threat. The old threat--and I appreciate what I think the administration's stated policy says. They prefer repealing the bill's general provisions that maintain this prohibition first enacted in 1998, but maybe the administration supports this amendment and maybe they don't support the amendment. 
   I believe this floor makes it less likely that we will consider an alternative to arms control as a method to reduce this threat. I am willing to look at alternatives such as star wars for which I voted. The strategic defense system is not in place today. I don't know when it will be in place. 
   In the meantime, the capacity to control Russia's nuclear system is declining and putting more and more Americans at risk as a consequence. 
   This is the third year, as I understand it, that this provision has been here. 
   Let me talk about strategic arms reduction. It has been the leading edge of our effort to try to reduce the threat. Back in the cold war, it was considered to be the only way that we will do it. I am not going to go through all the details of the history, but the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty was signed between the United States and the Soviet Union, START I, in 1991 and entered into force in 1994. It commits both sides to reducing their overall force level to 6,000 deployable warheads by December of 2001. Both sides are well on the way to meeting this deadline. The START II treaty signed in January 1993 and requires both the United States and Russia to deploy no more than 3,500 warheads by no later than December of 2007. The Senate ratified START II in 1996, but the Russian Duma has yet to take up the treaty. 
   Section 1041 of this authorization bill extends for another year the limitation on retirement or dismantlement of strategic nuclear weapon systems until the START II treaty enters into effect. Let me put this another way: The bill we are debating allows a foreign legislative body the final say on U.S. nuclear force levels. I do not believe this is how we should set our defense policies. Our military decisions should be based solely on what we need to protect and maintain our national security interests. 
   While I understand this provision was originally intended to encourage Russian ratification of START II, I think it is time to begin to rethink our strategy. For the foreseeable future, START II is dead. We can all make the case that the Duma should have acted, that ratification was more in their interests than in ours, or that the reason it failed was domestic Russian politics. All that is true. But we now need to begin to ask ourselves if the current policy of waiting for Russian action on START II is the best way to confront the dangers presented by the Russian nuclear arsenal. 
   I believe the answer is emphatically no. The provision in this bill I am trying to strike is forcing the United States to maintain an unnecessarily large nuclear arsenal. By keeping more weapons than we need to defend ourselves, we are encouraging the Russians to keep more weapons than they can control. That is the heart of the argument that I am making. 
   We are keeping more in our arsenal than we need, and as a consequence, forcing the Russians to keep more in their arsenal than they can control, increasing the risk of an accidental launch, a rogue nation launch, or a launch that comes as a consequence of an act of sabotage. 
   The determinant of adequate U.S. force levels should be left up to the men and women who are in charge of protecting the United States. While Pentagon officials have said they have  no plans to go below START I levels during fiscal year 2000, they have clearly stated their preference for lifting these artificial restrictions. In the recent testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, the current commander in chief of the Strategic Command, Adm. Richard Mies, said:  
   We believe that we ought to report to you on an annual basis on exactly what we plan to do, but we would prefer not to have the specific mandating of the force levels by delivery systems.  
   Our Armed Forces are more than capable of protecting U.S. national security with significantly fewer strategic nuclear weapons. In fact, Gen. Eugene Habiger, former commander of STRATCOM, said: 
    ``There is no reason to stay at the START I level from a military perspective.'' Our nuclear policy has become completely detached from the military requirements of defending America, and is now being used simply as a bargaining chip with Russian politicians. 
   Ironically, this is occurring at a time in which the Russian military is having problems maintaining its current force levels. The Russians foresee a time, in the near future, when drastic cuts will have to be made. In fact, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev has said publicly he sees the future Russian strategic nuclear arsenal in terms of hundreds, not thousands, of warheads. There are even some U.S. analysts who have calculated within 10 to 15 years Russia will be able to maintain a force no longer than 200 warheads. 
   I believe it is clearly in the Russian interest to work with the United States to achieve reciprocal reductions in forces, and I am disappointed the Russian Duma has chosen domestic politics over its best interests. However, it is just as clear that it remains in our interests to work with Russia to find new ways to reduce the number of nuclear weapons in a parallel, reciprocal, and verifiable manner. 
   We have a historical precedent to show that an adjustment in our nuclear forces, based solely on an evaluation of our defense needs, can help achieve the goal of reducing nuclear dangers. There is a precedent for this. On September 27, 1991, then President George Bush announced a series of sweeping changes to our nuclear force posture. After assessing our national security needs, Bush ordered all strategic bombers to stand down from their alert status, he de-altered all ICBMs scheduled for deactivation under START I, and he canceled several strategic weapons development programs. 
   On October 5--just one week later--President Gorbachev responded with reciprocal reductions in the Soviet arsenal. 
   President Bush acted, not out of altruism, but because it increased U.S. national security. In his announcement, he said:  
   If we and the Soviet leaders take the right steps--some on our own, some on their own, some together--we can dramatically shrink the arsenal of the world's nuclear weapons. We can more effectively discourage the spread of nuclear weapons. We can rely more on defensive measures in our strategic relationship. We can enhance stability, and actually reduce the risk of nuclear war. How is the time to seize this opportunity.  
   I believe the same is true today in 1999. The longer we wait to act--the more years in which we extend this legislative restriction--the more likely it is one of these weapons will fall into the hands of a person willing to use it to kill American citizens. 
   In addition to endangering the safety of the American people, our continued insistence on staying at START I levels is costing the American taxpayer. They are paying more to be less safe. 
   Estimates on the annual cost of maintaining our nuclear arsenal vary widely. The Pentagon contends the total cost is in the neighborhood of $15 billion a year. A more inclusive figure would put the cost in the area of $20 to $25 billion. This represents a significant portion of our yearly national security spending. For now, it continues to be necessary to maintain an effective, reliable nuclear force--a force capable of deterring a wide array of potential adversaries. 
   But if, as our military leaders have indicated, we can maintain that deterrent capability at much lower force levels, I am concerned we are wasting precious budgetary resources. The Congressional Budget Office recently conducted a study in which it found we could have between $12.7 billion and $20.9 billion over the next ten years by reducing U.S. nuclear delivery systems within the overall limits of START II. Both the Pentagon and the Armed Services Committee have already recognized that potential savings exist in this area. The bill before us allows the Defense Department to decrease the number of Trident Submarines from 18 to 14--producing a significant cost savings in our deterrent. 
   I am sure further savings could be realized with further cuts. I am certain our military has the ability to determine the proper formula in which we can reduce our nuclear arsenal, save money, and still maintain a healthy triad of delivery systems that will maintain our deterrent capabilities. I am confident much of this planning has already occurred. 
   I am also confident the distinguished members of the Armed Services Committee would be able to find ways in which to redirect these savings into other defense priorities such as preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, combating terrorism and narco-trafficking, or improving the 
   readiness of our conventional forces to confront the challenges of the 21st century. 
   My amendment does not mandate any reductions in the U.S. strategic nuclear arsenal. Rather, it simply eliminates the provision in this bill requiring us to maintain our forces at START I levels--a level that is unnecessarily high. 
   The greatest danger facing the American people today is Russian nuclear weapons. We have been given a moment in history to reduce this threat. Rather than acting on this opportunity, we are preparing once again to tie our own hands. The rapid pace of change in Russia and around the world will not wait for us in the United States Senate to debate for another year whether or not to seize this opportunity. We know what our relationship with Russia is today, We can predict, but we cannot know what it will be like in a year, or two, or ten. Circumstances may never again be this favorable for reducing the threat posed by nuclear weapons. We must act. If we do not, history may judge us harshly for our failure. 
   I see the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire is here, the chairman of the subcommittee. I think what I will do is yield the floor and allow my friend to speak for a while, and listen to what is likely to be his considered and well-spoken words.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, let me say that although we reach different conclusions, I completely agree with the Senator from Arizona. I do not think we should tie our defense policies to arms control agreements. I do not think we should do anything other than assess the threat and then try to put a force structure together that meets that threat, that keeps that threat as low as is possible. We should not cut corners. We should not get tied up in ideological knots. 
   We should decide what is necessary to keep Americans safe. I do think that it is much more likely that will occur if the U.S. military is as strong as we can possibly make it. There are significant new threats in the world that need to be met. I support the budget that has been proposed here. 
   I supported earlier the rampup in pay and other benefits. I think all that needs to be done. I think we have less in our intel budget than is necessary to both collect and analyze and disseminate the information to our warfighters and national policymakers. 
   What we are doing, as I see it, with this proposal is saying we are not going to do anything that might be in our interest, that might keep our country safer, because the Russians have not ratified START II. We are letting the Russians decide what our force structure is going to be. 
   We have been told by former General Habiger, who was the head of STRATCOM, that he thinks the United States of America will be safer and more secure if we went below START I levels. That is his assessment. He did not care what the Russians think about that. He thinks America would be safer and more secure if 
   we did. 
   I am not going to read all through it. I will do it later because I see the distinguished Democratic leader is here and would like to make some comments. I am going to read some things that ought to give Americans a great deal of concern about this ``loose nuke'' issue where the Russians are experiencing a deterioration in their capacity to control their nuclear weapons, and we are requiring them to be not only at a higher level than they need but we are requiring ourselves to be at a higher level than we need to be as a consequence of saying we are not going to do anything until the START II Treaty is ratified. 
   Let me set the record clear about the administration's position. 
   Senator LEVIN, for the record, in the Armed Services Committee, on the 3rd of February, asked General Shelton:  
   Would you oppose inclusion of a provision in the Fiscal Year 2000 Defense Authorization Act mandating strategic force structure levels--specific numbers of Trident Submarines, Peacekeeper Missiles and B-52 bombers?  
   He said:  
   Yes, I would definitely oppose inclusion of [that].  
   And a further statement of the administration about their attitude towards the defense authorization bill said:  
   The Administration [would] appreciate the bill's endorsement of our plan to reduce the Trident submarine force from 18 to 14 boats. .....  
   But they go on to say:  
   [W]e prefer repealing the bill's general provision that maintains the prohibition, first enacted in the FY 1998 Defense Authorization Act, against obligating funds to retire or dismantle any other strategic nuclear delivery system below specified levels unless START II enters into force. The Administration believes this provision would unnecessarily restrict the President's national security authority and ability to structure the most capable, cost-effective force possible.  
   They have announced no intent to go below START I levels, but they have indicated they prefer not to have this prohibition in there.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, again, this amendment strikes language that requires the United States of America to make its determination about how many strategic weapons we will have based upon a decision by the Russian Duma to ratify START II. 
   Some have described this amendment as encouraging unilateral disarmament. Nothing could be further from the truth. We make unilateral decisions and we decide what our forces are going to look like. On that basis, this entire bill is a unilateral decision. We haven't consulted with the Russians to determine what our Army is going to look like, how many divisions we will have, how many wings we will have in our Air Force. We have not made any consultation nor have we given the Russians a veto over any other part of our defense except for strategic defenses. 
   There we say that even if, as is the case, we have former STRATCOM commanders--in this case, Eugene Habiger--saying we would be well advised to go to a lower level, it would keep the United States of America safer than we currently are. As a consequence not only of measuring accurately how many nuclear weapons we needed in our triad--the land, sea and air-based system that we developed over the years--the greatest threat of nuclear attack to the United States of America is not China, is not an authorized launch by the Nation of Russia, it is an unauthorized launch. That risk has increased over the past few years as the Russian economy declines. As a consequence of that decline, they have decreased capacity to control their systems. This is not a small item. This is a significant threat to the United States of America. 
   One of the points I have tried to make is that we have been lulled into a false sense of complacency as a consequence of the end of the cold war. Statements are made that we are no longer targeting the Russians, nor they us. 
   In the past, I have not supported an early deployment of the strategic defense initiative, of missile defense. I have come to the conclusion as a consequence of this threat and others that the United States of America should. That is a unilateral decision. We made that decision not based upon what the Russians wanted but what we believed was in our best interest to keep America safe. That is how we ought to make our decisions about what our level is going to be of our force structure for nuclear weapons. 
   Not only are the people of the United States of America at greater risk as a consequence of forcing the Russians to maintain 6,000 at the end of 2001, but we are laboring under the optimistic scenario that maybe the Russians will ratify START II, in which case we can go to lower levels. But even at START II levels, the Russians would not be to 3,500 warheads until 2007. 
   We have to put an awful lot of our national security chips in the possibility that Russia will be in better shape in 2007 than it is today. These weapons systems are much more dangerous than the weapons systems in vogue today. There are serious threats from chemical weapons, from biological weapons, from weapons of mass destruction in that category, serious threats from terrorists such as Osama Bin Laden, serious threats as well that come from cyberwarfare and other sorts of things we are having conferences on all the time. China is unquestionably a threat, especially in the area of proliferation. But none of these, or all of them taken together, combined, are as big a threat as unauthorized launch of Russian nuclear weapons. 
   I hope, regardless of how this amendment turns out, the Senate will turn its attention to dealing with this threat. I think we are much better off dealing with that threat with a different strategy than the old arms control strategy. This is not an amendment that says we are going to tie our national security to START I or START II. Quite the contrary, I do not expect START II to be ratified in the next couple of years, if that, if it ever is ratified by the Duma. We should not hold up our national security decisions based upon what we expect or do not expect the Russian Duma to do. 
   I would like to describe some of these weapons systems so people can understand the danger of them, the kind of destruction they could do to the United States of America. The Russians have in their land-based system 3,590 warheads. They have in their sea-based system 2,424 warheads. They have in their air-based 564. 
   Just take one of these. Think, if you have a disgruntled, angry group of Russian soldiers or sailors or airmen who say: We have not been paid for a year; we are despondent; we do not think we have any future; we are suicidal. We are going to take over one of these sites, and we are going to launch. We are not going to blackmail the United States; we are not going to try to get them to do anything; all we are going to do is launch, because we are angry and we do not like the direction of our country and we do not like what the United States of America is doing. 
   Let me just take the SS-18. I am not going to go through the details of where these are. I am not going to describe for colleagues a scenario to take one of them over. I am not going to build a case, but I think I could build a case, that an SS-18 site is not as secure today as it was 5 years ago. That lack of security should cause every American to be much more worried than they are about the threat of China or other things we talk about and put a great deal of energy into describing. 
   The SS-18 is a MIRV'd nuclear system. It has 10 warheads on each one of its missiles, and each one of these warheads has 500 to 750 kilotons. If you put one of those in the air and hit 10 American cities--I earlier had a chart showing what a 100-kiloton warhead would do to the city of Chicago. Nobody should suffer any illusion of what the consequences to the United States of America would be if 10 of our cities were hit with a 500- to 750-kiloton warhead. 
   You say it is not likely to happen. Lots of things are not likely to happen that have happened. That is what we do with national security planning. We do not plan for those things that are most likely to happen. We plan for those things that are least likely to happen, because the least likely thing is apt to be the one that does the most damage, and that is exactly what we are talking about here. 
   You do not have to kill every single American. If you put 10 nuclear warheads with 500 to 750 kilotons of payload on 10 American cities, I guarantee the United States of America is not the superpower we are today. Imagine the devastation it would do to our economy. Imagine the emergency response that is required. Imagine all sorts of things. This country would not be the same as it is today if that were to happen. It is a terrible scenario. It is one we used to talk about way back in the 1980s. 
   I remember campaigning in 1988. We had a big portion of our debate about nuclear weapons and the danger of nuclear weapons and what are we going to do to keep the United States of America safe. The most vulnerable of the Russian triad are their nuclear submarines. I went through it earlier. A Delta IV submarine has 64 100-kiloton warheads on it. You could put 1 in each State and have 14 left over to pick some States you might put 2 or 3 on top of. 
   This is a real risk. Is it likely to happen? No. The likelihood is low. But low is not comforting when you are thinking about something such as that. Low should not give any American citizen comfort. I just heard somebody say it is not likely to happen; it is a low likelihood it is going to happen. 
   In the State of Nebraska, it is not likely a tornado is going to hit tonight.  But tornadoes hit there relatively frequently. We look up at the sky and say, ``It is blue; it does not look to me like a storm is coming,'' but storms hit out there just like that, and great destruction and devastation has occurred as a consequence. We have been lulled into a false sense of complacency about the Russian nuclear system and, as a consequence, we have not tried to figure out an alternative strategy. We need an alternative strategy. The Russian Duma is not going to ratify START II. I am here today to predict that is not going to happen. 
   We should not in our defense authorization say we are not going to take any action that might make America safer because we want to wait for the Russians to ratify START II. This amendment is described by some opponents as unilateral disarmament. It is not. It is no more unilaterally disarming than anything else we have in our defense authorization. We do not make decisions about what we are going to do for this Nation's security based upon what Russia is going to do in any other area of defense. 
   I cited earlier, I supported missile defense even though some said if we have missile defense, if we have an early deployment of missile defense, the Russians are going to do this, that, or the other thing, including maybe not ratifying START II. We did not make that decision based upon wondering what the Russians are going to do. We need to make national security decisions based upon what we think is in the best interests of the United States of America, to keep our people safe. This amendment does that. 
   The President has indicated he supports this amendment. He would like to get this limitation taken off. He does not have any plans to take action. I encourage him to do so. I think it is in our interests to think about taking our levels lower. I think the Russians would reciprocate. And even if they did not, the United States of America would still be safer as a consequence, by measurement of people who are a lot smarter and a lot more knowledgeable than I am on this subject. 
   For fiscal reasons, for reasons of scarce resources that need to be applied into our conventional readiness and things that our Air Force, Navy, Marines, and Army are more likely to have to be called upon to meet, for reasons of trying to reduce the risk of unauthorized launch that would be devastating to the United States of America, I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will give this amendment their full consideration and I hope they vote for it. A vote for this amendment is not a vote for unilateral disarmament. A vote for this amendment is a vote for the United States of America deciding what we think is in our best interests in national security and then authorizing accordingly in a defense authorization bill. 
   Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from California wishes to speak. The Senator from South Dakota, Senator DASCHLE, earlier said he would like to be a cosponsor. I am not sure he has been listed as a cosponsor. Senator KENNEDY as well, Senator BOXER as well, and Senator BIDEN as well.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I regret that Senators are on opposite sides of this issue, but we clearly are. I have offered this amendment because I believe our current strategy to deal with the threat of nuclear weapons is flawed in many serious ways. 
   First of all, this amendment has the support of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and Secretary Cohen. They have not announced any intent to go below the START I levels, but we are not asking for unilateral disarmament. We make decisions about how many men and women we are going to have in our Armed Forces, how big our Navy is going to be, how big our Army is going to be, our Marine Corps, our Air Force is going to be. Sometimes it goes up, sometimes it goes down. Nobody accused President Bush of unilateral disarmament at the end of the cold war when he drew our defense forces down. 
   I happen to believe we have gone too far. I support reinvigorating our Armed Forces. I don't support giving the Russian Duma a veto over that decision. 
   That is basically what this is all about. I do not know whether the President would exercise the authority, but in my view this amendment would allow the President to make a decision independently and say, this is the level of nuclear weapons that we need. I have heard knowledgeable patriots who have served their country, who have spent a great deal of time on this subject, say to me that we are, as a consequence of this law, maintaining a level higher than we need to keep the people of the United States of America safe, spending money that is needed in other areas, especially in the conventional area, forcing the Russians to maintain a level of nuclear weapons higher than their economy gives them the capacity to control, and dramatically increasing the risk of an unauthorized launch as a consequence. 
   That is the new risk. In the old days when we had arms control agreements--and I am not as optimistic about arms control agreements any longer. The Senator from Virginia asked if I supported the policy inherent in this language. Frankly, I do not believe START II is going to be ratified by the Duma. And even if it is, it has been overtaken by events, in my judgment. Even at that level, the Russians would be required to maintain a force structure of nuclear weapons that their economy does not allow them to safely maintain. 
   I think we would see continued deterioration and continued increased risk to the people of the United States of America not from a hypothetical risk here. All of our armed services have been vaccinated now against anthrax. The Chairman knows there are conferences about all kinds of new threats that are very real and very present. But there is no threat greater than the threat of Russian nuclear weapons. There is no threat that would arrive here faster, that would arrive here more accurately and more deadly than any one of a number of weapons systems that I could describe in the Russian nuclear arsenal. 
   In my view, what this does, quite the contrary to unilateral disarmament, is it allows the United States of America to decide what is in our interests. If I had reached a conclusion that I thought we ought to have 10,000 nuclear warheads in our arsenal, that that was in our interests, I would be on the floor arguing that we ought to; that rather than having a 6,000 floor, we ought to say that arms control is not going to work at all. If the Russians were doing something 
   that caused me to conclude that I thought we ought to have a higher level, I would argue for that. 
   I am arguing that the United States of America should make its own decisions when it comes to nuclear weapons. And right now, in my view, that decision would cause us to go below the statutory floor that we currently have and a further benefit would occur as a consequence enabling us to reduce the threat of an unauthorized launch. 
   Again, I have a great deal of respect for the chairman and admire his work and agree with him on lots of things that are in this bill, but I come to the floor to offer this amendment because I believe very passionately that it will make the people of the United States of America safer and more secure if it is adopted.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I appreciate that very much, although the only reason I was referencing Secretary Cohen and General Shelton's support, as Senator LEVIN indicated earlier and put in the RECORD, there has been some indication that perhaps the administration doesn't support eliminating this artificial floor. They do. They have no plans--they have not indicated that they intend to go any lower than this. But they have put in the record at the Armed Services Committee, in response to Senator LEVIN's question, that they support this amendment. They support eliminating this artificial floor.

   Mr. KERREY. I thank the chairman, Mr. President. 
   The largest gun dealer in the State of Nebraska is Guns Unlimited. The owner of that operation is a man by the name of Tom Nichols. I turned to Tom when this legislation was first introduced and when the issue of gun control came up because I trust him. I believe that he understands what works and what does not work. 
   As I said on this amendment when I first came to the floor, I have supported things that work. If I believe it is going to make the public safer, I will support it. If I don't think it will work, and that all we are doing is sort of a political figleaf, which happens from time to time on these issues, then I am not going to support it, because all we are going to do is add regulatory friction or interference with people who are law-abiding citizens, and it is just an irritant; it does not do anything other than perhaps make our press releases sound a little bit better. 
   But I asked Tom about this amendment. I have great respect for the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from Vermont. I think they have come a long way in closing the loophole on pawnshops, which is very important, because oftentimes people who are criminals or who have guns that they have stolen will go to a pawnshop and pawn the gun. They need to have a background check done. 
   There is still a significant weakness in this amendment. Again, I urge colleagues to vote for the Smith-Jeffords amendment--or is it Jeffords-Smith, whatever it is. I urge them to vote for that and to vote for the Lautenberg-Kerrey amendment. 
   Here is the reason why. In the words of Tom Nichols, the owner of the largest gun shop in the State of Nebraska--he sells more handguns and other kinds of guns than anybody in the State of Nebraska--80 percent of the people who come in to buy a gun in his shop are cleared in 24 hours. The instant check system gets them just like that. These are the law-abiding citizens. These people have absolutely nothing in their background at all that would indicate there is any kind of a problem. But, he said, the people of greatest concern aren't those 80 percent. The people of greatest concern are the ones who take a longer period of time, require a special agent to get into their background to find out what is going on. 
   If it is only 24 hours, what is going to happen is, yes, the law-abiding citizens will be OK; you will clear those out with no trouble at all. But those aren't the people who are the problem. Those people are getting cleared out in the 24-hour instant check, just like that. It is the people who require a little bit more work who are the ones we want to deny the opportunity to own a gun. 
   I urge colleagues, as they come down here, if you really want to try to change the law to increase public safety, my recommendation is to vote for the amendment offered by the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from Vermont, but then also vote for the amendment which has been offered by the Senator from New Jersey and myself. Ask your own gun dealers why and who and what happens with that additional 48 hours. They will tell you. The answer is, that is when you get the people who are the biggest problem. That is when you create the most public safety with the Brady bill background checks. 
   I understand that this issue has been highly charged and there has been a lot of heat and rhetoric and hard feelings on both sides which has occurred as a consequence of that. But if you are trying to write a law that will increase public safety, that will decrease the number of Americans who are either felons or dangerous or have something else in their background but own guns, I urge Senators to vote for both of these amendments, which we will have an opportunity to do, I guess, in about 10 minutes. 
   Again, I thank the Senator from New Jersey and others who have taken the leadership on this. I thank, again, Tom Nichols from Guns Unlimited in Nebraska. You put yourself out a little bit in this kind of situation. He is basically saying we need to have a level regulatory playing field. You have 2,000 or 3,000 gun shows a year. The Senators from Oregon and Vermont will allow instant checks for those gun shows, but we need that other 48 hours in order to be able to level the playing field between licensed gun dealers and gun shows. That is all we are doing. 
   There is no more money that they will be paying in, no more regulatory burden. It merely levels the playing field so people who buy a gun in a gun show and people who buy a gun from a licensed dealer will have to go through the same thing. If you want to make Americans safe, I urge you to vote for both of these amendments.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KERREY. The Senator says this would give the ATF the ability to levy a new tax. But under the modified proposal that we have, all we are doing is saying that a gun show operator--several thousand of them a year--will simply have to pay the same 
   relatively small fee that all licensed gun dealers do. Will the Senator agree that this is no different from what any licensed gun dealer has to pay, that basically what we are trying to do with this amendment is to say that if you have a gun show where it is possible that guns will be sold, you need to be licensed like everybody else and you need to pay a relatively small fee? 
   I ask the Senator that question. 
   Second, would the Senator agree that we have substantially reduced the amount of regulations that gun show operators would have to comply with in this amendment, that we struck, I think, three or four of the most difficult regulations, leaving only the requirement to register like all licensed dealers have to do and pay this small fee? They have to prove the identity of vendors when they check in at a gun show. That is just to verify the vendor is who they claim to be. And they have to post a sign indicating NISC background checks will be required. 
   Will the Senator agree that basically, first, there is a substantially reduced amount of regulations that we have in the first amendment, and, second, that all this tax the Senator has referenced, which is a fee, is the same thing that other licensed gun dealers would have to pay?

   Mr. KERREY. The Senator didn't take too much time at all. It is within your right to do it. I do have a markup with the Finance Committee and I appreciate very much the Senator yielding to me so I can make a couple of points about this amendment. 
   First of all, I do believe in the second amendment. I believe in the right to bear arms. I think it has meaning. In the past, I measured whether or not I will vote for changes in the law that restrict a citizen's right to own a gun that reduces their right by imposing waiting periods or increased licensing requirements by a simple test: Will this reduce the number of people who are having their rights violated by either being shot at, shot, or killed as a consequence of people who acquire guns illegally, using those guns to commit a crime? 
   I voted for Brady. I voted for the so-called assault rifle ban, though it didn't really ban rifles; it banned some  features. I feel confident when I vote for something that I think works. 
   What we have here, and I think both sides are agreeing, is a significant loophole in the law. There are thousands of gun shows every year where not only can law-abiding citizens go, but as a consequence of not having to be licensed--if you go to a Guns Unlimited in Omaha, NE, you have to get not just background checks but you have to get permits from the city of Omaha and the county sheriff. It takes a while before you buy a gun. 
   If you set up a gun show in Douglas County, no licensing requirements are necessary. You can buy any gun if you are a felon or mentally unstable, no background checks are required at all. 
   Both sides are saying we recognize that loophole needs to be closed. I noted last week, indeed, when the amendment was offered as a motion by Senator HATCH and Senator CRAIG, the headline of the Omaha World Herald said ``Republicans Close Gun Show Loophole.'' 
   What I am trying to say with this amendment is two things. One, some objections raised against the previous amendment talked about excessive amounts of regulation. I found that to be a credible argument. Senator LAUTENBERG was good enough to make significant changes in it, so all that is left now is for a gun show operator to do the same thing that a licensed dealer has to do, which is to register with ATF; they pay a small fee just as any licensed operator has to do; the vendor has to show proof of identification--that is, the person who is selling--that verifies the vendor is who they claim to be. And then basically a sign has to be posted notifying people, who are either vendors or there buying, that NICS background checks are going to be done. 
   That is all that is required. It is a fairly simple imposition of regulations that are the same for anybody who goes to a licensed gun dealer. In addition, you have to comply with whatever the local law is, the State law, or Federal law. That is all we are attempting to do. 
   I urge Senators who are considering whether or not to vote for this amendment to look at the language of the law as it is currently proposed in the Juvenile Justice Act, as modified, because the loophole is still there. Perhaps the distinguished Senator from Utah can address this, or somebody else who is a proponent of this. It says that special licenses can be granted to people who are running gun shows. It does not say that all gun show dealers have to register, as all licensed gun dealers do. It says some gun show operators can be granted special licenses and then they will not have to do background checks, they will not have to determine whether or not a person who is walking in to buy a handgun is a felon, whether or not they are mentally unbalanced, whether or not they have previous crimes they have committed. None of this is going to be required if this gun show operator can get a special license. 
   You say maybe there are some special cases where a special license is required. I urge Members to look at the language. The language says a special license can be granted to a person who is engaged in the business of dealing in firearms by, No. 1, buying or selling firearms solely or primarily at gun shows. 
   That is going to exempt everybody. Anybody who is out there who says I do not have a gun shop, I am not a licensed gun dealer, all I am doing is operating at gun shows, is going to be able to apply for a special license and be exempted. 
   You tell me how that is going to reduce the opportunity for a felon--again, somebody who has committed crimes in the past with guns--to go to an operator who is engaged in a business primarily operating at gun shows and not be able to buy a dangerous weapon. The answer is, they will still be able to buy. So if anybody believes we have closed this loophole as a consequence of the Juvenile Justice Act as it is currently amended, I urge you to look at the language. Anyone who is buying or selling firearms solely or primarily at gun shows can be given a special license and then will not have to do background checks. 
   Second, for anybody who is buying or selling firearms as part of a gunsmith or firearm repair business or conduct of other activity, as in this subsection, that seems not necessarily unreasonable. You can, I suppose, craft this thing so special exemptions can be granted. But we do not grant special exemptions for somebody who is out there as a licensed gun 
   dealer; they merely have to pay a small fee with the ATF and agree to do background checks. 
   If you talk to the licensed gun dealers today--many of whom opposed those background checks to begin with--they say they now basically are comfortable with it; it is operating relatively well, and it gives them increased comfort when they sell a handgun, knowing they are selling it to somebody who is not a felon; either the local sheriff or local police department signed off on it and said that person who has made that purchase is somebody who is a law-abiding citizen, who is not a felon, who does not have anything in his background that would indicate the rest of the public is going to be at risk as a consequence of him owning a handgun. 
   This amendment corrects precisely what many people objected to in original language, and that is, it reduces the amount of regulation. But it clearly says if you operate a gun show and you are selling guns, you are going to have to do what every licensed dealer has to do. You pay a fee to the ATF and you make certain you do background checks on anybody who is buying. That closes the loophole. 
   But current language as described here in law does not do that. Current language will still allow somebody who is primarily involved or solely involved in operating gun shows--it will allow them to say we do not have to get a license, we do not have to notify ATF, we don't have to do background checks, we can just set up shop. 
   You could even have a vendor at a gun show, under the proposal as this Juvenile Justice Act has been changed, a vendor who is also illegal--no background checks, no analysis required of the vendor as well. 
   There are other problems that can be identified. I am troubled as well by the pawnshop exemption in the Juvenile Justice Act as originally proposed, as is proposed today as well, because I think that also unnecessarily puts the public at risk. That is what we are talking about here. 
   All of us understand the Bill of Rights provides us with freedom but also understand there are limits. I do not have unlimited first amendment rights. If I libel or slander people, they can bring a case against me. I do not have an unlimited second amendment right. My second amendment right ends when I am a threat to somebody else. 
   This is not about restricting law-abiding citizens; it is about trying to write the law so people who are intentionally committed to violate the law have a more difficult time acquiring a weapon that will enable them to do grave bodily harm to, if not to kill, another member of our society. So I hope those who would genuinely want to close this loophole, who are looking for a way to basically level the playing field for somebody who is out there selling guns through gun shows and licensed gun dealers in the local community, want to have the same rules applying to both. 
   I hope my colleagues will consider what we will be doing if the Juvenile Justice Act, as modified, is enacted, and what we will be doing if the amendment offered by my friend from New Jersey, Senator LAUTENBERG, and I is accepted. I hope this will be accepted. We have significant numbers of Americans who are saying we do want to reduce this loophole, this risk that we see to our lives--not just our lives but our children's lives as well. 
   I think it is an altogether reasonable amendment. I was 
   surprised initially there was much controversy over it. I regret there is controversy over it. I hope this amendment will be seen by those who support the right to bear arms as a reasonable way to make certain that all Americans, gun owners and non-gun-owners alike, not only have a right to own a gun but have a right to the safety and security that all of us want to have in our homes and in our neighborhoods. 
   The Senator from Alabama is gone. I will, in his absence, thank the Senator from Utah for allowing me to speak so I can get back to the finance meeting.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the Senator from Utah said we are trying to make this amendment look like the Republican amendment. I may want to look like the Senator from Utah in many other ways, but we did not try to make this amendment resemble in two very key ways the amendment that was adopted last week. 
   I appreciate very much the concern about the regulation. In fact, as I said, the Senator from New Jersey made a number of changes to reduce the regulatory requirements. All we have left are the same regulatory requirements that all licensed gun dealers have to go through. 
   We will see about 3.5 million handguns sold this year through licensed dealers and 2 million in nonlicensed environments. What we are trying to do, for those of us who believe that background checks--there are some who do not. There are some who voted against the Brady bill and did not like the background checks. That is fine, but I think they have worked. They have reduced in America the number of felons who have handguns. They have reduced the number of people who are dangerous with guns from having handguns. It is generally accepted that the evidence shows Brady has worked and it has made America safer as a consequence. 
   What we have, though, is a regulatory differential. All of us can understand that. If one group of people are regulated one way and another group of people are regulated another way, it can produce some significant distortions in people's behavior. 
   Right now, it is easier to go to the 2,000 to 3,000 gun 
   shows every year and buy a handgun or another gun than it is from a licensed dealer. Why? Because you do not have to go through a background check. You do not have to do the same things that you do through a licensed dealer. I do not know if the concern about the black market was raised when Brady was passed. Perhaps it was. We did not create a black market with Brady. We still have people who are either felons or who should not have handguns, who are mentally unstable, or have something in their background that makes them, in the judgment of law enforcement, dangerous to own a gun.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KERREY. But the Senator said his fear with the regulation is that we are going to have black markets. All we do--and I urge colleagues, especially the public to listen--is we say to a gun show operator, like every other licensed dealer, a gun show promoter has to register with ATF and pay a small fee. 
   We are not passing on the cost of the background check. Brady does not allow that. I voted against that. It does not allow us to pass on the cost of the background check. All it says to the gun show operator is you have to do the same thing a licensed gun dealer has to do. You have to register with ATF and pay a small fee. 
   Secondly, the gun show vendor has to show proof of identification when they check in at the gun show to verify they are who they claim to be. And the third requirement, hardly a prohibitive burden, in my judgment, is they have to notify people at the show that there are going to be background checks. You can do that with a sign. 
   Neither one of these three things is what I call a burdensome regulation, for gosh sakes. They are what licensed dealers have to do, exactly what licensed dealers have to do. 
   Again, last week when the Craig-Hatch amendment was adopted, the headline in the Omaha World Herald was: ``Republicans Close Gun Show Loophole.'' Under this amendment, this is what you can do to get an exception. It is true gun shows will have to do background checks, except for people who have special licenses. Look who gets a special license: Somebody who is buying or selling firearms solely or primarily at gun shows. That is the first exception. Basically, I am saying, yes, if you are a gun show, you have to do a background check, you have to do everything a licensed dealer has to do unless you are a gun show. If you are a gun show, you do not have to do it. That is one of the exceptions provided in this law. 
   Again, if you want to go home and say, yes, I voted to close the gun show loophole, right in this thing it says I can get a special license to operate a gun show without having to do background checks if I am buying or selling firearms solely or primarily through gun shows. It does not get the job done. 
   We impose regulations on licensed gun dealers. I have consulted licensed gun dealers in Nebraska. I said earlier, I am a supporter of the second amendment. I believe the right to bear arms  means something. I believe the right to bear arms does not give me an unlimited right to bear arms, just as the first amendment does not give me an unlimited right to speak. 
   There are limitations on my right to bear arms. These are reasonable limitations to keep all the rest of us safe. The leading cause of death of teenagers in the United States of America is homicides and suicides. We are the only industrial Nation that has that. 
   We are not talking about picking up guns. We are trying to put something together that, like Brady, will reduce the opportunity of felons and people who have other things in their background which might make them an unreliable owner to have access to guns. 
   This is not an unreasonable regulation. This is exactly what licensed gun dealers have to do. The Craig-Hatch amendment simply does not get the job done because it allows somebody to say: I am going to get a special exemption because I am a gun show operator. 
   Secondly, I do not know the history regarding the loophole having to do with pawnshops, but for gosh sakes, we do not want to allow somebody to basically go in to a pawnshop and say: Here is my 357 Magnum, and I would like to get a certificate. 
   Maybe they stole it. A high percentage of people are concerned about pawnshops doing business, but we want that person to have to go through a background check when they pick up that gun. It has to be that a fairly significant percentage of those guns have been stolen and acquired in some way we suspect may put other law-abiding citizens at risk. It is not unreasonable when they come back to redeem their handgun that they have to go through a background check. That is not an unreasonable limitation of their second amendment right to bear arms. That is a reasonable limitation. 
   We understand that in a civil society, we have to give up a little bit of freedom from time to time in order to have a civil society. We do that. I do not have an unlimited right in freedoms. I have responsibilities as well, Mr. President. 
   This amendment corrects a deficiency in the Hatch-Craig amendment that is terribly important. It will make Americans safer. It will reduce the chances at gun shows that people who are dangerous who should not have guns will be able to buy them. It will reduce that chance. 
   Is it going to solve all the problems that are associated with juvenile crime and violence in America? Absolutely not. But it is absolutely reasonable to say that if you are a gun show, we are going to regulate you when it comes to background checks the same way we do a licensed dealer, the same way that we regulate anybody who wants to set up a licensed operation: a license from ATF and they have to do background checks. 
   Sometimes they have local ordinances that are even more severe. In Omaha, you have to go to both the police department and to the sheriff's office in order to eventually do a transaction when you are purchasing a handgun. It may have seemed unreasonable in the beginning, but it is working. It is making our country safer. 
   I hope colleagues who are genuinely trying to close this loophole will consider that this amendment gets the job done; this amendment will make America safer. It is not an unreasonable change in our law. For those of us who believe the right to bear arms has meaning, it is a reasonable change. In fact, I think it is going to make it more likely that we will keep the laws that will allow law-abiding Americans to own guns and use those guns to hunt, to target practice, and all the other legal applications for which, obviously, guns are used. I hope this amendment is considered seriously by colleagues who want to close this loophole and they will support the Lautenberg-Kerrey amendment.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I thank the managers of this bill for accepting the mentoring amendment that I offered, and I want to thank my colleague Mr. DORGAN for cosponsoring this amendment. 
   I believe that youth mentoring is an important piece of our effort to decrease violence among our young people. This amendment encourages us to take youth mentoring seriously. It asks states to develop criteria for assessing the quality and effectiveness of mentoring programs and to reward those programs that do a good job. It also asks the Departments of Justice and Education to disseminate information on best mentoring practices, so that mentors can receive guidance on how to make the best use of their time with students. 
   Since the school shooting in Littleton, Colorado, a few weeks ago, Congress and the nation have been grappling with the question ``How do we prevent such a terrible tragedy?'' The answer to this question is complex, and, as we know from our debate here on the floor of the Senate, there are many different points of view as to what more we should do to keep our kids healthy and safe. 
   I believe that one of the things we must do is increase the amount of quality time our young people have with caring, responsible adults. Without a doubt, the most important adult in a child's life is that child's parent. But even the most committed, well-intentioned parents cannot be with their children 24 hours a day. And often young people, especially teenagers, feel uncomfortable talking to their parents about sensitive or troubling issues. 
   That is why it is important that young people have someone in their lives they can turn to in troubling times. Now, some kids are fortunate enough to have a trusted aunt, uncle, or family friend in whom they can confide. But some are not so lucky. Fortunately there are caring adults who volunteer their time to become that trusted friend--we call them mentors. 
   We cannot know for certain that having mentors would have stopped the two teenagers in Littleton from harming their classmates. But we know that the young men were troubled. And if we can increase the number of individuals who are close enough to a young person to detect problems when they arise, we increase our chances of keeping those problems from spiraling out of control. 
   Mr. President, we know that mentoring works. In 1995 a Big Brothers/Big Sisters of America Impact Study showed that at-risk young people with mentors were 46% less likely to begin using illegal drugs; 27% less likely to begin using alcohol; 53% less likely to skip school; 37% less likely to skip a class; and 33% less likely to hit someone than at-risk children without mentors. 
   In a 1989 Louis Harris poll, 73% of students said their mentors helped raise their goals and expectations. 
   And a Partners for Youth study completed in 1993 revealed that out of 200 non-violent juvenile offenders who participated in a mentoring relationship, nearly 80% avoided re-arrest. 
   I believe in the power of mentoring, because I've seen it firsthand in my own state of Nebraska. In Nebraska, we have a fantastic program run by Tom and Nancy Osborne called TeamMates. TeamMates is a school-based program that pairs adult volunteers one-on-one with middle and high school students. 
   The Osbornes created TeamMates quite simply because they saw an unmet need. They realized that there are a lot of bright and capable young people out there who receive too little support and encouragement. In order to reach their potential to become good citizens and productive members of their community, these young men and women just need a helping hand. 
   Tom and Nancy started TeamMates in 1991, and the success they saw in that first year inspired them to continue. They started out with 25 matches, and of the students in those matches, 20 graduated from high 
   school and 18 pursued postsecondary education. 
   The response to TeamMates has been highly encouraging. Principals and administrators have commented on the positive attitude change they see in students in just the first year of their relationship with a mentor. And 99% of the mentors choose to continue their relationship with their students after the first year. 
   Right now there are 475 TeamMate matches throughout Nebraska. And they hope to have a total of 900 a year from now. 
   We have another terrific mentoring program in Omaha called All Our Kids, which began in 1989 at McMillan Junior High School. At present, nearly 80 mentors are providing guidance to at-risk junior and senior high school students.  
   And All Our Kids enjoys a strong relationship with the Omaha Public Schools System. OPS staff work closely with All Our Kids staff to identify students who need the services provided by its long-term mentoring and scholarship program. 
   With our help, TeamMates, All Our Kids, and other promising mentoring programs throughout the nation will be able to expand the horizons of more young people by providing them with caring adults to show them the way. 
   I also want to thank the managers for accepting my Sense of the Senate urging the President of the United States to allow each Federal employee to take one hour a week to serve as a mentor to a young person in need. 
   Recently, Jim Otto, Nebraska State Director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, called me and said, ``I read what you said about the importance of youth mentoring, and I want to let you know that I'm a mentor in the TeamMates mentoring program in Lincoln. I want you to know it's been a great experience.'' 
   Jim said he was fortunate that his employer allowed him to take one hour a week of administrative leave to spend time with his student. But he also said that some of his colleagues in other Federal agencies and departments were not so fortunate. Many employees would like to become mentors, but they just can't take time away from work. 
   Now, we have a lot of dedicated individuals throughout the nation who serve as mentors. Several members of my own staff participate in the Everybody Wins program in the D.C. Public Schools. And, as I mentioned earlier, we have great mentoring programs in Nebraska. But we need more adults to say, ``I want to make a difference.'' 
   The purpose of this legislation is to enable more adults to take the time to contribute to the well-being of their communities. It's just one hour a week, but in a child's life it can make a world of difference. 
   Mr. President, whether it's helping a student take an interest in schoolwork, helping build a young person's self-esteem, or helping a young man or woman communicate more effectively with parents, friends, and teachers, a mentor can be that invaluable safety net that keeps a child from falling into despair. 
   Now, there are many steps we can take to try to prevent violent acts once an individual reaches that point of desperation, but it is better for all of us if we intervene before that point--and it is also less costly. 
   With additional support for good mentoring programs we will be able to reach more young people before they become lost to substance abuse, isolation, or any other destructive behavior that leads them to commit acts of violence against themselves or others. In helping these programs continue their good work, we raise the hopes of more of our children. And when our children's hopes are high, we all benefit.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, first, I thank the distinguished Senator from Texas and the Senator from Maryland. There are a number of provisions in this legislation for which I thank them. 
   One of the things all of us have to do when looking at this piece of legislation is ask the question whether or not we are going to be able to maintain the safety and soundness of the banking system. It is a pretty dramatic change allowing companies that previously had been prohibited in certain lines of business to engage in those lines of business. 
   I want to make it clear, I reached the conclusion that we do have the regulatory capacity to maintain safety and soundness, whichever piece of legislation emerges here. I appreciate very much the work of the Senator from Texas on this, as well as the work of the Senator from Maryland. 
   I will point out a couple of things, as well, that I am very much grateful for, and one of them has to do with modernizing the Federal Home Loan Bank System that allows rural banks and other banks to have access to credit. I think it is a very important provision. Senator HAGEL offered it, and I commend him for his leadership on it. 
   I also want to make it clear on the CRA, at some point it is going to get to conference. I do support what Senator GRAMM is doing to provide exemptions to banks under $100 million. Under urgings, I had conversations with my larger banks who do not find themselves with the kind of difficulties of being coerced into making payments, as he noted exists in other parts of the country. While I support under 100, I do not support the other changes that are being proposed. 
   As to this amendment, the takings issue, Congress does this all the time. In fact, my guess is there could be people who make a claim that because the bill itself is passing, they are going to suffer a loss of value in their business. 
   Gosh, we debate the ethanol provision and we debate tax credits for the oil industry all the time. Sometimes you get it, sometimes you do not get it, but you do not file a claim against the Government as a consequence of that action. 
   People could file a takings action against this bill based upon what the Senator from Texas just argued. The Winstar case does not open up the door. Indeed, the Winstar case is being appealed itself. The Winstar case does not open up the door to prevent Congress from passing legislation in trying to modernize our banking system.

   Mr. KERREY. I quite agree. Not only is it a contract case, but the decision by the D.C. Court of Claims is on appeal. We do not know what the outcome is going to be. It was a specific contract that was signed between the Government and these businesses. They have a legitimate case that they are making that a contract was broken. 
   If the takings argument is going to provoke a fear every single time Congress proposes a change in the law, it is going to make it awfully difficult for Congress to do the very thing that the Senator from Texas, the Senator from Maryland, and the Banking Committee is proposing to us, which is that we ought to modernize our banking system. 
   There will be losers as a consequence. 
   Can you imagine coming to the floor and saying, we cannot pass fast track? There are losers when we have free trade. So if I vote for fast track, and we give the President normal trade negotiating authority, and somebody  loses, can they file a claim as a consequence and say I have taken their property? No. 
   So I appreciate very much some of the other arguments the Senator from Texas is making, but I think the takings argument would cause this Congress a great deal of difficulty. In fact, we should withdraw the bill altogether if takings is the concern that we have, because there will be losers. There will be economic losers as a consequence of this piece of legislation who could, if they chose to, file a takings action based upon the argument that was made earlier. 
   This is a fairly simple amendment. I urge colleagues to look at it. The concern that the Senator from Texas is raising may be a legitimate concern. Some of the details he was talking about may need to be modified. But we are saying that, ``Notwithstanding paragraph (3), no company may directly or indirectly, including through any merger, consolidation, or other type of business combination, acquire control of a savings association after May.......unless the company is engaged, directly or indirectly (including through a subsidiary other than a savings association).......'' 
   It is an attempt to say, yes, we needed to do what the Senator from Texas described earlier in order to be able to clean up the savings and loan problem. 
   We make no judgment here that the unitary thrifts are not safe or sound. We have an outstanding one in the State of Nebraska that is doing a tremendous amount of business, and they are a very safe operation, very sound operation. We make no judgment about that at all. But we are just saying the Banking Committee already has spoken on the issue by eliminating the commercial market basket. 
   What we are doing with this is to prevent further kinds of transactions precisely because we are ending the restrictions that were under Glass-Steagall for 60 years. We are eliminating those. We are going to get all kinds of new transactions going on in that environment anyway. We are concerned about whether or not we are going to maintain safety and soundness. 
   I believe we can. I believe we can in the new regulatory environment. I am willing to do that. But this just adds considerable new risk to the transaction, considerable new risk. I believe the Office of Thrift Supervision is down to about 1,200 employees. I am not sure they have the capacity to regulate. It provokes a whole new concern about this legislation, as to whether or not we are going to be able to maintain the safety and soundness that the people of the United States of America expect. 
   To be clear, I have not had a single citizen in Nebraska come to me and say, ``I need financial services modernization''--that is, borrowers and depositors. Indeed, I have only a few banks in Nebraska altogether that are interested in this. The people who are interested in this are people who are much larger operators. They have come to me and asked my support for this legislation, and I have given it to them. I do not believe there is any more reason for us to maintain these barriers between these various industries. But we need to be very careful.

   Mr. KERREY. I believe we need to be very careful not to increase, in an unnecessary fashion, that risk. And this amendment will reduce that risk. It will not increase takings claims against the Government. It will not increase litigation as a consequence of saying that we are not going to allow continued and new unitary thrift acquisition and new commercial interests to come in and purchase savings and loans. 
   Mr. President, I appreciate the fine work the Senator from Texas has done and the Senator from Maryland has done. I hope we can get this legislation in a form that I can support, because I believe financial services modernization is something that has long been needed and is long overdue.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today to state my strong opposition to the McCain-Biden resolution currently pending before the Senate. I intend to vote to table this resolution. 
   I continue to have concerns about both the failure of diplomacy that led to the use of force in Kosovo and the current military strategy being employed. But now that U.S. Armed Forces are engaged, we should send a strong message of unity and determination to see the mission through. President Milosevic should know both the U.S. Senate and the American people remain committed to achieving our objectives. 
   I will vote to table S.J. Res. 20 for three reasons. First, the language contained in the resolution is too broad. I respect what Senators MCCAIN and BIDEN are trying to accomplish with this resolution; they are trying to increase the chance of success of our military operation. However, I do not support giving the President of the United States the authority to ``use all necessary force'' to accomplish our goals in Kosovo. I find it disturbing that the United States Senate is considering a resolution that would give the President more authority to exercise military force than he has requested. Passage of this resolution would be the equivalent of giving the President a blank check to operate militarily in Yugoslavia. 
   Secondly, passage of the resolution would abrogate Congressional responsibility for the conduct of this war. The Constitution provides the Congress with a clear role in the use of military force. While the President has consistently stated his belief that ground forces will not be used in a non-permissive environment, passage of this resolution would allow the President to reverse his position without prior Congressional authorization. To be clear, Mr. President, if this resolution were to pass, the President would be able to commit the full might of the U.S. military in Kosovo without first coming to the Congress and explaining the mission, without explaining the military objectives, without explaining the exit strategy, and without explaining how such a deployment would affect our military commitments around the world. Mr. President, the American people should expect more from their elected representatives; Congress should not surrender its Constitutional responsibilities in this matter. 
   Finally, I oppose the McCain-Biden resolution because it is the wrong legislative statement at the wrong time. While I recognize S.J. Res. 20 is before the Senate due to the parliamentary intricacies of the War Powers Act, it does not provide an appropriate starting point for a Senate debate. The truth is, the Senate is long-overdue in conducting a real debate over our role in Kosovo. What are our objectives? What are our long-term strategic interests in the Balkans? How do our military actions Kosovo affect our commitments to peace and stability throughout the world? These are the sort of fundamental questions we should be debating on the floor today. Rather than providing a starting point for discussing our policy options, the McCain-Biden resolution merely provides the final answer: the President knows best. This is not the statement I want to provide to the people of Nebraska. 
   I remain hopeful that the current air campaign will bring about a return to diplomacy. President Milosevic must realize that NATO's objectives--to stop the humanitarian tragedy in Kosovo, return the Kosovar people to their homes, and re-establish Kosovar autonomy--will be achieved. The only hope for the Serbian people is a negotiated settlement. In the mean time, the United States and our NATO allies should continue to apply pressure on the Serbian government while working with nations like Russia to establish the basis for a settlement. In the long-run, the United States and Europe are going to have to address the issues of peace and stability in the Balkans in a larger context of economic development and ethnic security. 
   Mr. President, Congress does have a role to play, both in the short-term discussion of our current military actions and in the long-term discussion of our broader policy in the Balkans. We must begin to talk about these issues in a serious manner or continue to face the prospect of having our decisions made for us as events pass us by. Mr. President, let's table the McCain-Biden resolution and begin a real debate on Kosovo and our national security interests.

   Mr. KERREY. I am pleased to join the Senator from Idaho. This amendment would apply the same budgetary restrictions to mandatory programs that we have on discretionary programs. Mandatory programs are growing faster than the discretionary programs. We are converting our budget from one that used to be almost entirely discretionary, endowing our future, into a budget that is largely mandated by law. 
   This simply says if we are going to add a new mandatory program, you do as you would with the discretionary program: You need to have 60 votes to get the job done. It doesn't mean you can't; it just raises the bar as high as it is on discretionary programs. 
   I hope my colleagues see the wisdom of this and will support it.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President I rise today to talk about the great progress we have made reducing our federal deficits. I am proud to have participated in and voted for three budget acts--in 1990, 1993, and 1997--which have radically altered the fiscal condition of the Federal government and the debate about how the public's hard-earned tax dollars should be spent.  
   When I arrived in the Senate 10 years ago, we had a deficit of $205.2 billion. We were awash in a sea of red ink. Budgeteers were predicting deficits as far as the eye could see. In fact, since 1989, our publicly-held debt has increased from $2 trillion to $3.7 trillion. Hundreds of billions of dollars of borrowing was needed every year to fund the Federal budget. This borrowing had two effects: it kept interest rates for all public borrowing higher than necessary and it caused the net interest costs of the U.S. government to rise as a share of total Federal spending. 
   After the enactment of these three budget acts--particularly the 1993 and 1997 budget acts--and on account of impressive gains in private sector productivity and growth, we were able to reverse the deficit trend. Deficits have continued to shrink since 1994--and we were able to celebrate our first unified budget surplus (counting Social Security) of $70 billion last year. I am hopeful that the Congressional Budget Office's August re-estimate will allow this Congress to celebrate its first real budget surplus since 1960. 
   Deficits are yesterday's problem. Today, budgeteers are telling us to expect budget surpluses as far as the eye can see. I am proud to say that we are able to celebrate the fruits of our fiscal restraint--not because we had to abide by an inflexible constitutional amendment--but because we had the sheer will and political courage to put ourselves on a spending diet. Americans should feel good about that. And my colleagues who took the tough votes on fiscal restraint should also feel good about the budget surpluses we are now enjoying. 
   Through our progress on controlling spending, we have also made some progress on entitlement and net interest expenditures. Back in 1994, I co-chaired the National Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform. In its final report, the Commission predicted that ``without changes to programs or increased taxes, entitlements and interest on the national debt 
   are projected to consume all federal revenues by 2012. In 2030, entitlement spending alone will exceed all Federal receipts.'' The fiscal restraint that we have displayed in the succeeding 5 years has changed the short-term picture of entitlement and interest expenditures dramatically. 
   Today, about 53% of our Federal budget is spent on mandatory programs like Social Security and Medicare; 34% of our budget is dedicated to discretionary spending (like NASA, NIH, roads and bridges, and the armed forces); and 13% of the budget is spent on interest on our national debt. Depending upon whose numbers you look at--the Republican Budget Resolution, the President's budget, or the CBO projections--our fiscal discipline will allow us to pay down our publicly-held debt and reduce our net interest costs. These interest payments will continue to decline as a percentage of our total spending--from about 13% today to somewhere between 3 and 5 percent by 2009. Although discretionary spending will continue to decline as a percentage of total spending--this decline will occur more slowly than previously predicted. Over the next decade, discretionary expenditures will decline from about a third of total expenditures to about a fourth of total expenditures by 2009. And although mandatory spending will continue to rise as a percentage of total expenditures--from 53% today to 70% of spending by 2009--it will grow at a slower rate than we had previously predicted. 
   The strong growth in our economy and the subsequent strong growth in the taxable wage base has increased the solvency of our Medicare HI and Social Security OASDI Trust Funds. That same report from the Bipartisan Commission on Tax and Entitlement Reform predicted back in 1994 that with no changes, the HI Fund would be insolvent in 2001. But the latest statistics show that the HI Fund will be solvent until somewhere in the year 2010. Our 1994 report also noted that the Social Security would become solvent in 2029. In 1998, the Trustees of the Social Security Trust Funds announced that our strong growth would extend the solvency of the OASDI Trust Funds to 2032--and I have reason to believe that the short-term solvency of the Trust Funds will be extended even further after the Trustees release their 1999 report next week. 
   While we should pat ourselves on the back for our tough votes in 1990, 1993, and 1997, we must remember that our agenda remains unfinished. Today, I want to challenge the Senate to start tackling the last piece of unfinished business. I am, of 
   course, referring to the biggest political problem facing our generation of legislators: how do we work together in a bipartisan manner to modernize, reform, and improve the Medicare and Social Security programs for our children and grandchildren? Our demonstrated fiscal responsibility has bought us some time--and some breathing room--to think about how we want to reform our safety net programs, restore solvency to our entitlement Trust Funds, and reduce the out-year proportions of the budget which finance our entitlement programs. 
   Although we've slowed the growth in our entitlement programs, it must not go unnoticed that this year we will spend $20 billion more in Medicare and Social Security benefits than last year--and next year we will spend $30 billion more than this year. That $30 billion increase in Medicare and Social Security benefits is more than our total combined expenditures on the State, Justice, and Commerce Departments during 1999. The additional money we will spend each year on Social Security and Medicare benefits will only begin to increase as the first Baby Boomers start retiring during the next decade. 
   The President's own budget outlines for us the troubling long-run budget projections for the Social Security and Medicare programs. Right now, we spend the equivalent of 4.5% of GDP on Social Security benefits and about 3.6% of GDP on Medicare and Medicaid. By the year 2050, we will be spending about 7.2% of GDP on Social Security benefits and 9.7% of GDP on Medicare and Medicaid benefits. This is a dramatic increase in entitlement expenditures--a doubling from 8.1% of GDP today to 16.9% of GDP in 2050. My Nebraska constituents need to know that the more we spend on entitlements, the fewer tax dollars will be available for the education and training of our children, or the research and development of new medicinal drugs, or space exploration. The analytical tables in the President's budget show that discretionary expenditures will continue to decline from about 7.6% of GDP today, to about 3.6% of GDP in 2075. 
   I want to challenge my colleagues to seize upon the opportunity to modernize, reform, and improve Medicare and Social Security during this era of budget surpluses. We need to think about helping people become less dependent on the government for their retirement security. For example, I support the idea of allowing individuals to have a payroll tax cut of 2 percentage points, which they could invest in individual accounts. But these individual accounts are not the end in itself--but the means to 
   an end. The means to a more independent retirement--a retirement that involves the ownership of wealth and the creation of an asset that can be passed on to heirs. We need to decrease the demand of future retirees on the government by making changes to Social Security that reduce costs--but also provide retirement security. 
   Efforts to reduce the costs of the program are made harder by changes to the Social Security program enacted back in 1983. Some of my colleagues--particularly Senator MOYNIHAN--may remember that back in 1983, Congress agreed to ``pre-fund'' the Social Security benefits of the Baby Boom generation by allowing the program to take in more income than it needed to pay the benefits of current beneficiaries. This excess payroll tax money was supposed to flow into a Social Security Trust Fund. As we all know, this money was borrowed from the Trust Fund throughout most of the Reagan, Bush and Clinton years to finance the general operations of government. When Treasury starts paying back the money it borrowed from the Trust Fund in 2013, it will pay these IOUs with general revenues--meaning individual and corporate income tax dollars. 
   Most of my constituents are probably not aware that these changes in 1983 will give beneficiaries from the Baby Boom generation a claim on $6.85 trillion of income tax revenues--in addition to the payroll tax claim they already have on tomorrow's workers. The  President is proposing to increase the Baby Boomers' claim on income tax dollars to over $30 trillion. I do not support this change--I believe that we have an obligation to make structural reforms to the program within the current payroll tax structure. I applaud many of my Democratic colleagues who have taken a courageous step in opposing this misguided effort to ``save'' Social Security through additional income tax dollars. But I want to remind my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that simply setting aside the surplus for Social Security or Medicare reform is not a reform plan--it is a debt reduction plan. 
   I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to have an honest and open debate about the way we want to finance and reform the Social Security program. I believe that Congress and the President can and should work together to achieve real structural reforms in the program--and do so in a way that helps low-income Americans and that shares costs across all generations. 
   In addition, I would argue that we need to modernize the Medicare program to expand choice, increase competition, and include prescription drugs. As those of us who served on the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare know through painful experience, Medicare poses an even more difficult problem than Social Security reform. By providing health care coverage, it provides a second essential element of retirement security for older Americans, as well as serving as an important safety net for disabled Americans who can no longer work. Medicare spending is unpredictable and, to a certain extent, uncontrollable--spending growth is largely driven by the amount of health services that beneficiaries use, technological developments in medicine, and--particularly in the future--enrollment growth. 
   And to complicate matters further, the public is not yet ready to undertake a significant change to the Medicare program. They know how valuable the current program is to themselves, their parents and grandparents. They want to be sure that they have the same coverage, or better, when they retire. And they don't see the need to make hard decisions about spending and benefits. 
   We need to look at these difficult dynamics and make the difficult choices that are necessary to keep the Medicare program solvent while ensuring that we have the flexibility we need within the Federal budget to address other national priorities. Last week, I voted with nine other Commissioners to adopt a more competitively-based model for financing and administering the Medicare program. I think this type of reform will move us in the right direction by helping us control costs, and ultimately helping us improve benefits. We can't simply pour new general revenues into an un-reformed Medicare program, and wait to deal with the larger problems at a later date. 
   The surpluses that have appeared, in part due to our fiscal discipline, provide us with a unique opportunity to reform our growing entitlements burden. The choices involved in achieving Medicare or Social Security reform are tough--and may even require some tax increases or benefit cuts. The pain of tax increases or benefit cuts will be made much less harsh if we use these budget surpluses to help reform our Social Security and Medicare programs. I do not believe we should use the on-budget surpluses for a debt swap or for a large tax cut that will primarily go to high income individuals. We must avoid the instant gratification of a large tax cut at the expense of the delayed gratification that comes with reforming our entitlement programs and reducing the tax burden on future workers. 
   I look forward to working with the House, the Senate, and the President to complete this unfinished agenda.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the crisis in Kosovo. President Clinton and our NATO allies are at the point of having no other option except to conduct air attacks against Yugoslav forces operating in and near the Yugoslav province of Kosovo. I regret we are at this point, but that doesn't change the facts. At this crucial moment, Congress should not tie the President's hands or give Mr. Milosevic the slightest reason to believe the  United States will not join with its allies in airstrikes against the Yugoslav units that are burning and shooting their way through Kosovo as I speak. For this reason I will vote for the resolution. 
   A requirement to use military force often follows a failure of diplomacy. That is not the case in Kosovo; this Administration and our major European allies have worked hard to bring about a just and peaceful outcome in this Albanian-majority province which also has such powerful historic and emotional significance for Serbs. A just and peaceful outcome would have been possible, but for the unwillingness of the Milosevic regime to govern Kosovo on any basis other than force and fear. Common sense and appeals to higher motives did no good, and now force will meet overwhelming force in what can only be a tragic outcome for many Yugoslav soldiers. 
   The President is out of options, and we must support him and the aircrews who will carry out his orders. But I am under no illusions that airstrikes will fix the Kosovo problem. The best I hope for is that the airstrikes will bring Milosevic back to the table to accept a NATO-brokered agreement for a peaceful transition in Kosovo. Such an outcome would at least stop the killing and would accustom all in the region to the idea of an autonomous Kosovo. Even if we succeed to this extent--and it is by no means certain we will--the underlying instability in the region will persist. 
   The Kosovo problem is really the problem of a minority ethnic group, the Albanians of Serbia, who have not been fully accommodated. The Albanian minority in Macedonia has the same problem. Within Albania proper there is an ethnic Greek minority, and concern for that minority has created tension in the past between Greece and Albania. My point is not to induce despair about the complexities and complexes of this one small corner of the Balkans, but rather to encourage Congress and the Administration to see the region as a unity and work simultaneously in all the affected countries to promote solutions. Just fixing Kosovo won't do it, and I'm not confident we can do even that. 
   If airstrikes can begin a transition to a Kosovo settlement, the next step will be the insertion of a ground force to keep the transition peaceful. The Administration has proposed this force include about 4,000 American soldiers or Marines, and has promised to deploy this force only in a ``permissive'' environment--meaning a Kosovo in which at least the leaders of the various factions agree to the presence of our troops. Mr. President, the resolution before us does not deal with the question of ground troops. When that question does arise, I will oppose any deployment of U.S. personnel on the ground in Kosovo. The stability of the entire planet depends on the readiness and availability of the U.S. Armed Forces. We should not fritter them away in peacekeeping missions in countries which do not rise to the level of vital American interests. We should keep them ready for the contingencies that are truly in our league: Iraq and the Persian Gulf, the Koreas, Russian nuclear forces. Europe contains wealthy countries with the militaries that could take on local European missions like Kosovo. It is their problem, and they should step up to it. 
   Mr. President, several other reasons are raised to justify U.S. deployments to Kosovo. Some assert a ``domino effect'' from Kosovo will plunge Europe into war. After all, they say, World War I started in the Balkans. But the alliance systems, rival empires, and hair trigger mobilization plans of 1914 are nowhere apparent in today's Europe, so there is no need to fear a return of World War I. We are then told the instability could eventually cause war between Greece and Turkey. But Greece and Turkey could have fought over many things over the last forty years, most recently the Ocalan affair, and they did not. There are rational leaders in Athens and Ankara who know their own interests. Kosovo will not set them off. 
   As I said, the Administration should be praised for working for years on the thankless task of trying to bring peace to Kosovo. At this point, airstrikes are the last option available. The people of Kosovo, as well the Serbian people and all the people of the region, deserve a dignified, secure peace. Diplomacy, supported by U.S. and other NATO airpower and, when appropriate, European ground troops, should aim to bring this peace about. The United States should concentrate on the bigger problems which truly threaten us. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the financing of the Social Security program. The President's plan to reserve the surpluses for Social Security has presented us with an opportunity to have a discussion about the way Social Security is currently financed--and to have a debate about how we want to finance the Social Security system in the future. 
   I want to say at the outset that some of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have closely examined the President's proposal to infuse the Social Security system with general revenues--and decided not to support a financing reform mechanism that does not lead to structural reforms. For my colleagues on the Democratic side who have decided not to support general revenue transfers to Social Security, this is a politically difficult position to support--but a commendable one. 
   With his plan to reserve the surpluses for Social Security, the President has helped me to understand for the first time that the Social Security program is facing a serious funding problem in the year 2013. I now realize that in 2013, the payroll 
   tax dollars flowing into the Social Security program will no longer be large enough to fund the current level of benefits. As a result, the Social Security Administration will start cashing in its trust fund assets--those special-issue Treasury bonds--to pay for Social Security benefits. 
   The Treasury has to make good on these bonds by giving Social Security a portion of general revenues. This means that starting in 2013, Social Security beneficiaries have a claim on not only the payroll tax dollars, but also the income tax dollars of working Americans. Let me say that again, Mr. President. Starting in 2013, Social Security beneficiaries have a claim on both the payroll tax dollars and the income tax dollars of working Americans. So as not to mislead, let me say that these beneficiaries will also have a claim on other general revenues, such as corporate income tax dollars. Furthermore, in order for the Treasury to make good on these obligations without cutting discretionary spending, it is likely Congress will either have to raise income taxes or return to deficit spending. 
   Now under current law, this infusion of general revenues into Social Security is scheduled to end in 2032--at which point a future Congress will have to decide whether to raise payroll taxes or cut benefits. The President's proposal allows this Congress to pass the responsibility for enacting reform off to the Congress convening in 2055. Furthermore, what the President proposes to do is to fund a substantially larger portion of the program with income tax dollars. In fact, he is turning a funding problem into a funding virtue by guaranteeing that future income tax dollars will continue to fund Social Security benefits until 2055. This means that the baby boomers will have an even larger claim on future tax dollars. 
   On how many future income tax dollars do the boomers have a claim? Well, in fact, the Social Security actuaries have quantified for us exactly how many more general revenues will be given to the Social Security program as a result of the President's plan. According to the actuaries, Social Security beneficiaries already have a claim on general revenues worth $6.45 trillion in nominal dollars. President Clinton will commit an additional $24.765 trillion in general revenues to the Social Security program between the years of 2015 and 2055--for a total of $31.215 trillion in general revenues. 
   You heard me correctly, the President's plan commits an additional $24.765 trillion of general revenues--$4.85 trillion in 
   constant 1999 dollars--to pay for Social Security benefits--above and beyond the 12.4 percent payroll tax that is levied on all workers. This chart demonstrates that in any given year we will be committing up to $2 trillion of general revenues for Social Security benefits. If you look at this in terms of constant 1999 dollars, we are talking about $200 to $300 billion  of general revenues that will be committed to Social Security each year in the 2030s, 2040s, and 2050s. If you look at it in terms of a percentage of GDP, the Clinton plan will divert general revenues worth 1.5 percent of GDP to Social Security for each year from 2032 through 2055. That is a general revenue transfer each year nearly as large as the entire defense budget. 
   Now it may come as a surprise to my constituents watching this at home to hear that the President is committing massive amounts of future general revenues to Social Security. And the reason they aren't aware of this fact is because he has made no effort to inform them. He has cleverly hidden his proposal behind the rhetoric of ``saving the surplus for Social Security.'' If the President wants to openly make the case for funding more Social Security benefits through income tax dollars, let me be the first to encourage an open and honest debate on that very subject. In fact, it is a very Democratic argument to fund Social Security through the more progressive income tax rather than the regressive payroll tax. But I encourage him to enter this debate candidly and to explain to the American public the tradeoffs of infusing general revenues into the Social Security program. 
   I have heard the group of us who are working on substantive Social Security reforms--Senators MOYNIHAN, BREAUX, GREGG, and SANTORUM--referred to as the ``Pain Caucus'' because we advocate structural reforms to the system through benefit changes or future payroll tax adjustments. Well, we believe less in pain that in truth in advertising. The President also has a great deal of pain in his plan--a hidden pain in the form of income tax increases that will be borne by future generations of Americans. I strongly disapprove of a plan that provides a false sense of complacency that Social Security has been saved by this nebulous and vague idea of ``saving the surplus''--while failing to disclose the real pain that will be imposed on future generations. 
   Let me talk for a moment about the history of the Social Security program and its financing. The idea of a Social Security program was first discussed by Frances Perkins as a 
   means for providing the widows of coal miners a financial safety net. Today, the Social Security program provides an intergenerational financial safety net to retirees and the disabled, and their spouses, survivors, and dependents. Social Security has always been financed by a tax on payroll. When the program began, the total payroll tax was 1 percent of the first $3,000 of earnings--paid for by both the employer and employee. Today, all covered employees pay a Social Security payroll tax that is equal to 6.2 percent of the first $72,600 of their annual wages. In addition, the employer must pay an additional 6.2 percent payroll tax on the first $72,600 of each employee's wages. 
   The excess Social Security payroll tax income has always resided in a trust fund. Through the 1970s, this trust fund generally had only enough assets to pay for about one year's worth of benefits. The 1977 Social Security amendments marked the first time that the trust funds were allowed to accrue substantial assets--though this accrual was not necessarily deliberate. 
   During the 1983 reforms, Congress made this implicit accrual of assets explicit--and declared its goal to be the prefunding of the baby boom generation's Social Security benefits. Congress tried to pre-fund the baby boom generation by accelerating the payroll tax rate schedule increases that were agreed to in the 1977 amendments, by covering all federal government and non-profit employees, and by raising the payroll tax rate on the self-employed. 
   Not surprisingly, several Presidential administrations took advantage of the overflowing Social Security coffers--and used an overlevy of the payroll tax to fund both the general operations of government and expensive income tax cuts. Many of the payroll tax dollars that flowed into the trust funds were immediately borrowed to pay for tanks, roads, and schools. Many of these payroll tax dollars were also used to offset major income tax breaks. Is it any surprise that Reagan was able to afford a reduction in the top marginal tax rate from 70 to 50 percent in 1981 and from 50 to 28 percent in 1986 in the wake of the payroll tax hikes of 1977 and 1983? 
   The irony is that the story has now come full circle. While former Presidents financed income tax cuts with payroll tax hikes, Mr. Clinton now wants to maintain a lower-than-necessary payroll tax rate by increasing future income tax revenues. 
   Mr. President, one of my goals today is to make clear my desire that this Congress and this President have an honest debate about how to finance Social Security. But one of my other goals today is to talk about the need to reform the program to improve the lives of our Nation's minimum wage workers. As many of my 206,278 Nebraska constituents collecting old-age Social Security benefits can attest--Social Security is not a generous program. In fact, the average old-age benefit in Nebraska is under $750 a month. When you factor in rent, food, prescription drug benefits, and part B premiums, $750 is not a generous benefit. 
   As many of my colleagues may know, the size of a retiree's Social Security check depends on a number of important factors--how much you worked, how much you earned, and at what age you retire. In order to determine your monthly benefit, the Social Security Administration takes all of this information and applies a complicated benefit formula designed to replace a portion of the monthly income to which you have become accustomed over the course of your life. This replacement formula is not very generous for low-wage, low-skill workers or for workers who have been in and out of the workforce sporadically. The way it works is that Social Security will replace 90 percent of the first $505 of average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) over your lifetime; plus 32 percent of the next $2,538 of earnings; and 15 percent of any earnings over $3,043 per month. 
   Complicated? Yes. But what this means is that a worker who has been consistently in the workforce and has had lifetime annual earnings of $10,000 per year will receive a Social Security benefit check of about $564. This is not substantial--and barely livable. What I propose to do is change the benefit formula to replace a larger portion of the income of these low-income, low-skilled workers who play a very important role in our service economy. And I propose doing this in a cost neutral way. By simply changing the replacement formula, we can boost that workers' monthly income by 22 percent. 
   What I have tried to show this morning is that we need to have an honest and open debate about the way we want to finance the Social Security program. We also need to have a candid and constructive discussion about Social Security reforms that will improve the retirement security of all working Americans--including those working Americans who are toiling away at low-paying service sector jobs. I believe that Congress and the President can and should work together to achieve real structural reforms in the program--and do so in a way that helps low-income Americans and that shares costs across all generations. 
   Mr. President, Harry Truman had a sign on his desk which read: ``The buck stops here.'' Unfortunately, what this President's plan is saying is that the buck stops there--in 2055. 
   Our generation has a historic opportunity to make some sacrifices now, so that our children and grandchildren may benefit from our having served this nation. The sacrifices we make may not be as dramatic as those of the generation that lived during Harry Truman's Presidency, but they will have a significant impact on the future of our Nation. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. I want to thank Senator EDWARDS, Senator HAGEL, Senator DASCHLE, Senator BOXER, Senator DURBIN, and all the others who have spoken. I appreciate very much and am very moved by these words and more moved by the friendships in this body. 
   Thirty years ago is a long time. I am reminded of a slogan at the beginning of any exercise to remember what happened, especially in combat 30 years ago, and I will give you the watered-down version of that slogan. The only difference between a fairy tale and a war story is, the fairy tale always begins, ``Once upon a time,'' and the war story always starts off, ``No kidding, this is true; I was there.'' 
   We don't necessarily have perfect memories when it comes to bringing back that moment and I, for one, have always been very uncomfortable--and BOB BENNETT earlier said he wanted to make me uncomfortable by saying some nice things about me. I have been uncomfortable for almost 30 years to be introduced as a hero, and it made me somewhat uncomfortable in part because I did do something that was simply my duty; I didn't feel that evening that I had done anything necessarily out of the ordinary. 
   Indeed, JOHN MCCAIN's father upgraded my award from a Navy Cross to a Medal of Honor. Otherwise, this event might not be happening at all. There are many men, Senator INOUYE will tell you, who received nothing, whose actions weren't seen or were seen by somebody who didn't like them, or were seen by somebody who liked them but couldn't write very well, or something else happened to their award along the way. So I am aware that there are many people who have done heroic things that were not so recognized. 
   As a consequence of being introduced all the time and being given many opportunities to think what it means to be a hero--and I again appreciate very much all this recognition--my heroes are those who sustained an effort. In my case, it was the effort of a single night. Who knows; in the daytime, I may have performed differently. I may have, under different circumstances, done things differently. 
   The heroes who are impressive to me are those who sustained the efforts, whose bravery, whose courage, is called upon every single day. I think of my mother; I think of my father. I think of millions of men and women who, as mothers and fathers, sustained the bravery and the courage needed to be a good parent. I think of all those volunteers who came out not just to my hospital--I watched Bob Dole on television in 1988 in Russell, KS, break 
   down at the start of his Presidential campaign as he remembered what it was like to come home to Russell, KS, and be welcomed into the arms of people who took up a collection so he could travel to see his father. 
   The heroes in my life are the people in Lincoln, NE, who welcomed me home and who gave me far more than I thought I had a right to deserve. One of the people in my life who has been very important--I have never met him, but I read his work; indeed, he was killed shortly before I went to Vietnam. Although he was a great opponent of the war, he came back in an airplane, along with other men who had been killed in that war--is a man by the name of Thomas Merton. Merton wrote,  
   Human nature has a way of making very specious arguments to suit its own cowardice and its lack of generosity.  
   I find myself falling victim to that understandable human part of myself. I do sometimes exhibit cowardice. I do sometimes exhibit a lack of generosity. All of us, I suspect, have those moments. 
   It is the ever-present need to sustain the bravery to do the right thing that impresses me the most. Those whose brave acts are done, knowing there will be no recognition, knowing there will be no moment when they will be recognized and stand before their colleagues, trembling and wondering what to say in response--it is those brave acts that are done anonymously that are most important of all. 
   I have received a gift in many ways as a consequence not just of the award and considering what heroes are but also as a consequence of my injury. I don't know if Senator INOUYE feels the same way. 
   I remember a night almost 30 years ago to the day, in 1969, when a nurse came into my room very late at night. It was a difficult night for me. 
   And among other things, she said to me that I was lucky to be alive and that I would get through this, I would survive it, I would get through this valley of pain that I was in at the moment. Well, I remember not believing that. I believed that I was not necessarily lucky to be alive at all at that particular moment of my suffering. 
   Today I recognize that she was absolutely right, that I was lucky to experience suffering and know that you do not have to feel pain for pain to exist, that it is out there as I speak, as we hear these words. That suffering is universal is a lesson I was given in 1969, and perhaps of all the lessons I was given, it was the most important of all. 
   I was also given a gift in discovering that the world is much bigger. It is not just us white men from Lincoln, NE, who grew up in a middle class home and had a great deal of abundance as a result of two rather extraordinary and loving people. It is a world composed of many colors, many creeds. It is a world composed of over 6 billion people, not just the 270 million who live in the United States of America. 
   I have been taught and had the chance to learn that you do not really heal until you have the willingness, courage and bravery to forgive people who you believe have done you wrong. I would not be back in public service, I do not think, were it not for Walter Capps, who invited me to come to Santa Barbara to teach a class on Vietnam, where in studying the history of that war I was able to forgive a man I hated--Richard Nixon. I doubt that former President Nixon felt any relief in that moment when I forgave him, understanding as I did then how easy it is to make mistakes when you are given power. But I was the one who was healed. I was the one who was liberated. I was the one who was able then to live a different life as a consequence of my having the courage in that moment to forgive. 
   I have discovered, through my own healing, that the most powerful thing that we can give, the most valuable thing we can give another human being costs us nothing. It is merely kindness. It is merely laying a hand on someone and saying to them, as that nurse said to me, that it will be all right; you are not alone here tonight; you are not alone with this suffering that you are feeling. 
   I also learned through service in the Senate. Oddly enough, at a time when people think that the only reason that we are given to vote a certain way is because there are financial contributions hanging in the balance, I have learned in this Senate that a nation can be heroic. I discovered on the Appropriations Committee, of all things, that that hospital in Philadelphia was not there by accident. It was there because a law passed this Congress--a law that was signed by Richard Nixon--authorizing that hospital to be operated, authorizing those nurses, those doctors  and all the rest of those wonderful people to be there to save my life. A law made that possible. I made no financial contributions in 1969. There wasn't a politician in America who I liked. Yet, this great Nation allowed its Congress to pass a law that gave me a chance to put my life back together. 
   In 1990 and 1991, as a Senator, I went back to Southeast Asia, with the Bush administration, trying to find a way to bring peace to Cambodia. We succeeded in 1992. But in going back, especially to Vietnam in 1991, and especially in the South, I discovered again something rather remarkable about the people of this great country--that though I still believed the war was a tragic mistake and that we made lots of errors along the way, the people of South Vietnam repeatedly said to me, ``We know you came here to fight and put your life on the line for strangers, and that you were willing to die for us will not be forgotten.'' 
   I sat, along with my colleagues, and listened to Kim Dae-jung of South Korea say the very same thing in even more personal ways. Our Nation can be heroic by recognizing that we might write laws that give all of us a chance at the American dream, and by recognizing that as a great nation there will come a time when we must risk it all, not for the freedom of people that we know but for the freedom of strangers. 
   I did, as JOHN KERRY said earlier, come back to the United States of America an angry and bitter person. I did not have my patriotism intact. I had gone to the war patriotic because it was a duty, and I stand here today before you honored by your words, moved by your sentiment, and to tell you that I love the United States of America because it not only has given me more than I have given it, but time and time again it has stood for the right thing, not just at home but abroad. 
   I appreciate just the chance to be able to come to this floor and offer my views on what our laws ought to be. I appreciate very much more than I can say to all of you--Senator EDWARDS, Senator DASCHLE, Senator HAGEL, and the others who have spoken--your sentiment, your words and, most of all, your friendship. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for S. 257, the National Missile Defense Act currently pending before the Senate. I do so with the firm belief that passage of this legislation will help keep the American people safe. Given the seriousness of the threat posed by ballistic missiles, it is our duty to act to confront this threat through the development of a national missile defense system. 
   I believe some of the controversy surrounding this piece of legislation comes from the misperception of what national missile defense really is. Mr. President, we are not proposing to build a star wars-style system. We are not proposing to build a system designed to counter a massive nuclear attack from the Soviet Union. That plan was unworkable in the 1980s and is unnecessary today. Instead, the missile defense system we are talking about today is a limited system, designed to protect the United States from rogue-state ballistic missile launches and accidental launches--precisely the kind of threats that will not be countered by our traditional reliance on deterrence. 
   The truth is, Mr. President, we do not currently possess the ability to protect the American people from these threats. But we should. The legislation we are debating today would take the first step toward protecting the United States by declaring it to be the official policy of the United States to deploy a national missile defense system. The bill before us does not identify a particular system for deployment It does not authorize or appropriate a single dollar. These are decisions that will be left up to this and future Congresses. Instead, the National Missile Defense Act simply states that the United States should deploy a missile defense system to protect the American people. 
   Mr. President, perhaps the only situation worse than not having an adequate missile defense system to protect the American people, is deploying a system that has not been proven feasible. I am pleased with the recent announcement by the Clinton administration that they plan to increase spending on missile defense research by $6 billion over the next five years. I applaud the administration's decision to fund missile defense in the fiscal year 2000 Defense budget so that a decision to deploy a missile defense in 2005 could be made as early as June of next year. We should all take note of the outstanding scientific and engineering efforts which have been ongoing for years in the Defense Department to get us to this point. This administration deserves credit for vigorously attacking the very daunting set of scientific and engineering challenges by which a bullet can strike another bullet. At the same time, development of a system will only come through further research and development and a rigorous testing regime. 
   Many opponents of this legislation have asked why should we take this step now? It's true, the threat of ballistic missiles is not a new one. The American people have lived for decades under this threat. In fact, during the cold war, the Soviet Union had thousands of nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles pointed, ready to shoot at American cities. What has changed is the source of the ballistic missile threat. During the cold war, and even today, we used the power of deterrence to protect ourselves. Nations like Russia and China know that an attack on America would be met with an immediate and overwhelming response by United States forces. They were and still are deterred by a calculation of their own self-interest. However, the underlying assumption of deterrence is rational behavior by the other side. None of the  emerging threats--whether they be terrorist states 
   or rouge or desperate individuals--can be counted on to respond rationally to the threat of retaliation. 
   In the past, I have voted against cloture on the motion to proceed to this bill. However, two distinct events over the last few months have highlighted the changed nature of the threat and have led me to support this legislation. First, the release of the Rumsfeld Commission Report last July stated that the newer ballistic missile threats are developing from countries like Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. The report went on to state that these nations could be able to acquire the capability to inflict major destruction on the United States within about 5 years of a decision to acquire ballistic missiles. Furthermore, the Rumsfeld Report warmed that these emerging threats had more mature capabilities than previous assessments has thought possible. 
   Then, almost on cue, North Korea tested the Taepo Dong I missile on August 31, 1998. The details of this test have been widely reported in the media. But the real lesson of this missile test was that our intelligence community was surprised by the North Koreans' ability to launch a three-stage missile. We saw that North Korea may have the ability to hit parts of the United States with a missile with a small payload. We also know that the North Koreans continue to work on the Taepo Dong II; an intercontinental missile with the capability of reaching the United States mainland. In addition, North Korea's nuclear capability and nuclear ambitions turn these missile developments into a clear strategic warning. 
   Mr. President, aside from demonstrating the validity of the conclusions of the Rumsfeld Report, the North Korean missile test put a face on the emerging ballistic missile threat. There may not be a more unpredictable regime on earth than that of Kim Jong II. A government which continues to pour resources into weapons of mass destruction while its people undergo a famine is beyond our understanding. But I have no doubt of North Korea's willingness to use ballistic missiles--in an all-out desperate act of terror--against United States cities. Traditional threats of massive retaliation are unlikely to deter a man as unstable as Kim Jong II. They will not likely deter the Iranian or Libyan governments or other future rogue states. Instead, we must protect our nation through a limited missile defense. Time remains for us to counter this threat. But we must act now. 
   Mr. President, opponents of this legislation have valid concerns about how national missile defense will affect our relationship with Russia. I share these concerns. Our long-term global interests are best secured by maintaining a cooperative relationship with Russia. While a wide variety of Russian political leaders have expressed their opposition to United States national missile defense, I do not believe Russian opposition is insurmountable. 
   Just as our allies like Britain and France realize United States national missile defense is not directed against them, the Russians can be convinced the threats we seek to counter through missile defense come from unauthorized and rouge-nation launches. Furthermore, these are threats--given their proximity to countries like Iraq, Iran, and North Kora--Russia must also confront. Although Russia has deployed an ABM system around Moscow, there is nothing particular about Russia that will make it impervious to these threats. Mr. President, in their vulnerability I see a chance to engage Russia; to work cooperatively to confront the mutual threat of ballistic missile proliferation. By jointly developing national missile defense with Russia, we will make our citizens safer and improve our bilateral relationship. Similarly, the problems presented by the ABM Treaty 
   may in fact present opportunities. There is no reason why we can't work with Russia to adapt the ABM Treaty to reflect the changes that have occurred in the world since the treaty was signed in 1972. At that time, we could not anticipate the proliferation of ballistic missile technology we face today. By changing the treaty to allow each side to develop a limited missile defense system to protect from unauthorized or rogue launches, we can address the threat, maintain the treaty, and not upset the strategic balance ABM sought to create. 
   Mr. President, I see further opportunity to reduce the threat of ballistic missiles and make significant strides in our relationship with Russia. In the past, and again today, I call on the President to seize this opportunity to make a bold gesture to reduce the danger posed by United States and Russian strategic nuclear weapons. More than 6 years after the end of the cold war, both the United States and Russia maintain thousands of nuclear weapons on hair-trigger alert. My fear, Mr. President, is our maintenance of more weapons than we need to defend our interests is prompting Russia to keep more weapons than she is able to control. 
   I have proposed that the President, acting in his capacity as Commander in Chief, order the immediate elimination of U.S. strategic nuclear forces in excess of proposed START III levels. Such a bold gesture would give the Russians the security to act reciprocally. Russia not only wants to follow our lead in such reductions, it must. Russia's own Defense Minister recently said, publicly, that Russia is thinking of its long-term nuclear arsenal in terms of hundreds, not thousands. To help Russia accomplish these reductions, Congress must be prepared to provide funding through the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. We should spend whatever is necessary to help Russia dismantle and secure its nuclear arsenal. The best form of missile defense is helping Russia destroy its missiles. 
   Mr. President, my support for the bill before you comes from my belief that its passage will make Americans safer. The time to prepare for the emerging threat of ballistic missiles is today. The legislation before us sets us on the path to confront these threats in a real and manageable way. I strongly encourage my colleagues support for this legislation and I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I voted today in support of the Gramm amendment which supports my belief that the FDIC's ``Know Your Customer'' regulation should be withdrawn. This vote mirrors my earlier action where I had written to FDIC Chairwoman Tanoue asking her to withdrawal the regulation. 
   While I commend FDIC's effort to identify and crack down on illegal activity, I am deeply concerned the ``Know Your Customer'' regulation will threaten the financial privacy of Nebraska customers. 
   When federal regulators consider any regulation like ``Know Your Customer,'' the private relationship between customers and their financial institutions should be given the utmost consideration. I believe ``Know Your Own Customer'' would severely strain this relationship. Customers should feel confident that their financial transactions are done in confidence and not subject to uninvited searches. Bankers in Nebraska already report large cash transactions, violations of federal law and potential money laundering activity without invading the privacy of their customers. ``Know Your Customer'' would require financial officers to infringe on their customers' privacy, damaging public perception of the banking industry. 
   On behalf of the many Nebraskans, customers and bankers, who have relayed similar concerns with me, I am pleased the United States Senate has taken this action. In the meantime, I will remain committed to see that FDIC withdraws the ``Know Your Customer'' regulation.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, earlier this morning, Senator GRASSLEY of Iowa introduced a bill that I am a cosponsor of called the International Child Welfare Protection Act. I would like to talk about that piece of legislation and the objective of that legislation. 
   I first became aware of this problem through the efforts of the junior Senator from Iowa, TOM HARKIN, who came before the Finance Committee earlier this year to describe the need to put in our trade authority language that would have the negotiators negotiating for the purpose of reducing the use of child labor worldwide. I support that. I believe the Finance Committee should, when we mark up the normal trade authority, put that language in. My hope is that this piece of legislation will provide a stimulus to do that. 
   This legislation Senator GRASSLEY and I are introducing says that economic growth is not just about the bottom line; it is about improving human lives. 
   I believe this piece of legislation can help do that, Mr. President, by taking an incentive-based approach to encourage developing countries to do the right thing on child labor. Instead of threatening them with access to U.S. markets, this bill says we are going to hold out an incentive and offer them U.S. markets at a price they currently can't access. 
   Now, the action we ask them to take in exchange is to sign the International Labor Organization's Convention on Child Labor. That convention states that the minimum age for admission to employment shall not be less than the age of completion of compulsory schooling: either 14, 15, or 16 years of age. For that agreement, we will provide preferential access to the world's largest consumer market for additional products. 
   As I said, I believe this is a good move for the United States to make. I think it does provide incentives, for developing nations especially, to change their own policies toward child labor. But I also think it is important to try to get into our negotiating authority language that directs our negotiators to keep child labor in mind and try to negotiate for the purpose of reducing the use of child labor in nations with which we trade. There should be a connection between trade and growing the middle-class worldwide. 
   Unfortunately, all too often, trade is measured only in terms of the dollars that we export and the dollars we import. For me, it is far better and more likely that we will have public support for good, open trade policies, if we use trade as a means to an objective, not just to produce a better bottom line, not just to produce higher trade numbers, but to increase the standard of living of people in the United States and to increase the standard of living of people throughout the world. 
   The single best way for us to assure access for U.S. goods overseas is for us to help the middle class grow in other countries. The only way to do that is for people to produce and sell goods that other countries want to buy and their own people can afford. It is a very difficult process for developing nations. We went through it in the United States of America. But for those developing nations to lift their middle class, they have to open up their markets and subject their businesses to competition. Otherwise, their standard of living will constantly be depressed as a result of simply saying that we are only going to complete up to the standard of our domestic 
   marketplace. 
   When I talk about international trade issues, Mr. President, that is the fundamental truth with which I began. Free trade--reducing tariffs both here and abroad--will help the middle class to grow. And a prosperous and growing middle class has a positive effect on the issues we face in trade policy today. Indeed, I argue that it is one of the reasons we have struggled to get normal trade authority from the President. As least as I see it in Nebraska, there is growing skepticism that there is a connection between the standard of living of the people who are in the workforce today and the trade policies. 
   Many of my citizens have reached a conclusion that there is a negative connection, and that free trade policies have depressed their standard of living and made it more difficult for them to earn the wages they feel they deserve as a consequence of the work they are doing every day. We have many problem in trade policies that make it difficult for us to convince the American people that free trade is unquestionably a good thing. The legislation Senator GRASSLEY and I have introduced today says we want to make progress on these issues. 
   The International Labor Organization estimates that more than 250 million children worldwide between the ages of 5 and 14 are obliged to work either full-time or part-time in developing countries alone. Many work under condition that are debilitating for their physical, moral, or emotional well-being. 
   Far too many are employed in the fields, rug factories, and electronic factories that hope to export products to the United States of America. What this bill does is go directly to that desire. 
   This bill would immediately cause other countries to say, desire. 
   This bill would immediately cause other countries to say, ``We can sell products to the U.S. consumers that we could not sell before. All we have to do is agree to an internationally recognized standard on child labor.'' 
   If they sign that agreement today, they gain access to American markets and American dollars tomorrow. It is an approach that has worked for the Europeans. It is an incentive-based, rather than a punitive, approach; it is a trade policy that is increasingly recognized as a better way to proceed on some of these very difficult issues.  
   We want children to be the beneficiaries of economic growth, not the engines of it. To us, it is evident that it is self-defeating for economic growth to come at the expense of our children. 
   This bill is a step in the right direction, and I hope it represents to the people I serve that I am willing, in fact, I look forward to coming to the table on these very difficult and sticky trade issues that have divided us in the past. 
   I hope it is seen, as well, as an important first step--but a first step only--in reducing the terrible consequences of allowing these young children to be used for labor in these developing countries. It is a very important issue that Senator Harkin has worked on for years. He brought it to the attention of the Finance Committee. I believe the committee is responding in a first-step fashion, and I hope they will follow this action with further changes in the negotiating language that will say to our negotiators: we want you to put child labor at the top of your concerns when you are negotiating trade agreement.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I think there is something that is going to happen at 5:00. I am going to talk for a while and wait and see if the leaders can resolve the little stalemate we have going on on the floor right now. 
   Title I is a very important program in Nebraska. It serves somewhere between 37,000 and 38,000 students, but costs us about $800 per student per year. We have about 80 schools that have schoolwide Title I programs and about 350 that are in the targeted program. 
   One of the concerns I have in general with education is, we typically are fighting with peanuts. I do not mean to say that $8 billion is peanuts, but relative to the cost of some of our larger programs we rarely debate around here, Title I is still a relatively low-cost program. 
   By that I mean, one of my issues since I have come here to the U.S. Senate has been to try to alert both the people of Nebraska, as well as the people in the Senate, that we have a tremendous problem with our growing mandatory programs: Social Security, Medicare, the long-term portion of Medicaid. I must say I am not very pleased with the progress of that debate this year. We are fighting ourselves with a significant amount of constraint in discretionary spending. There is a big debate going on right now whether we ought to lift the budget caps that are currently imposed to $574 billion for this year for budget outlays. One of the reasons there is pressure on that is these mandatory programs continue to take a larger and larger share of the total budget. 
   For all the talk about Medicare in the last few years, you would have thought we cut it. During the 1997 balanced budget agreement, I know many people were concerned that we were cutting Medicare. Medicare continues to go up about $20 billion per year over the next 10 years. We have to decide, it seems to me, if we are going to maintain laws that place a minimal amount of restriction on business, that keep kind of an entrepreneurial spirit alive and well in the United States of America. I am in favor of cutting some of the regulations we have on business today. We do not impose a great deal of restriction on what people are required to do with their employees. 
   We have minimum wage laws, but, beyond that, we do not require health insurance and we do not require pensions like many other nations do. If we are going to do that, it seems to me we are going to have to reexamine the fundamental laws we have governing our so-called safety net. That is going to lead us, it seems to me, both to change the structure of our Social Security system as well as to change the structure of our health care system. 
   Unfortunately, what happens is, we get terrified about the time an election shows up, and we get concerned about whether or not changing eligibility age or some other adjustments in the cost of these programs will enable us to survive an election. As a consequence, we rarely take any action. 
   Indeed, I must say the President's budget, though it is attractive in many ways, has a couple of significant flaws that make this problem even worse, in my view at least. The biggest flaw is that the President requires us to take the surplus and exchange publicly held debt and transfer it over to, in one place, the Medicare trust fund, the other, the Social Security trust fund--nearly 65 percent I believe the total number is. What this is going to do is give people who are eligible either for an old-age benefit or health care benefit out in the future a larger and larger claim than they have even now on our taxes. 
   I say that preliminarily, because I examined the Title I program considerably in my State and I see it is doing a great deal of good. It is not just being used for low-income people, although free and reduced-price lunch guidelines mean schools that have incomes of $31,000 for a family of four would qualify. Mr. President, $31,000 is typically Mom and Dad--at least in my community--both out there working like mad, trying to make ends meet. It is not what people would think of when they think of traditional ``poor'' folks. In this case, we have more poverty on a percentage basis in rural Nebraska than we do in urban Nebraska, and, as a consequence, these Title I funds are enormously important. They are like a lifeline. There are 37,000 students being served by it. That is about 17,000 short of the total who are eligible. We have another 17,000 schoolchildren out there who are eligible, by Federal guidelines, to be assisted. 
   As you examine what is being done by these schools, how they are using these basic grants and the concentration grants, you can begin to get an idea not only of the problems that are being faced but the need that is there and the good that gets done if we are able to provide these Title I funds. 
   Under the Ed-Flex bill, which I like a lot, we are granting the States some additional flexibility which will be enormously helpful in my State, especially in the rural areas. I have been using this piece of legislation as an opportunity to work with the Department of Education to get them to help Nebraska--in fact, get a waiver to help us develop our Title I plan, using the standards and assessment of the local districts. The State would approve those local plans, but it is not quite a State plan. 
   We have been having difficulty getting that waiver, and I thank the Department of Education for helping us accomplish this goal. Secretary Riley has been enormously helpful in that regard. It gives us another window into the problems we are facing right now of children of lower-income working families. 
   Understand that the world has changed considerably. I graduated from high school in 1961, just shortly before the ice started to recede back up into the North. In 1961, three-fourths of my graduating class went right into the workforce. There were good jobs available in 1961 that supported a family at the Havelock shops for Burlington Northern, at Goodyear, at Western Electric, the new AT&T plant that just opened up in Omaha. They were good jobs. The rule was, you went out and got a job. That job supported your family. You did a little time in the service. You came back from the service. The job was there, and you worked at it for the rest of your life. 
   Mr. President, a third of our high school graduates who are going straight into the workforce today find a much different 
   situation. I support free trade. I want our laws to provide us with free trade opportunities. But that puts a tremendous amount of pressure on these young people to compete in a global economy in a way that I was not required to do when I graduated in 1961. 
   I would like to keep the restrictions on business to a minimum so that we can grow our economy and allow entrepreneurs and the energy of the entrepreneur community to create new jobs and wealth in America. But if we are going to have both of those things, it seems to me what we have to do is be very diligent in the first place about being willing to tackle these mandatory programs where a larger and larger share of our budget is going, but we are also going to have to be willing to invest in these young people and give this lifeline to the State and local educators who are trying to make Title I a program that does, in fact, give our young people the reading skills, the math skills, and the other skills they are going to need when they graduate from high school. 
   I am very much troubled about that one-third of the class who are now going right from high school into the workforce with the kind of skills that they have, given what the marketplace is asking them to have in order to get the kind of job they are going to need to support their families.  
   Title I is one of the bills that has been mentioned repeatedly here on the floor of the Senate, especially by people who are concerned about the impact of this Ed-Flex bill--I believe Ed-Flex is going to enable us to make Title I an even better program than it is right now. Now Title I is one of those programs that has a name on it, a number on it--I know when I talk to educators, I sometimes have to get a translator to tell me what exactly they are talking about--but it also has people behind it. 
   When you see the impact of Title I, at least in my communities, it is a program that not only deserves to be supported, Mr. President, but, in my judgment, when we reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we need to find a way to put more money into Title I. 
   We made significant reform in 1994 requiring standards to be developed, requiring assessments to be developed. We made it a much better program. But in my State there are 17,000 eligible kids whom we cannot serve simply because we don't have enough money to get the job done. 
   There are few programs right now in education--in fact, there is none in education-- that I believe does more in my State to help our children acquire the skills they are going to need when they graduate and go into the workforce to earn the kind of living they will need to support a family and to achieve the American dream. 
   I see the distinguished chairman has walked back on the floor. I am prepared to yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with Senator ROBERTS the Crop Insurance for the 21st Century Act. 
   This bill will make crop insurance more affordable, more flexible, and more responsive to the changing needs of farmers. 
   That has been our goal from the start, when we asked for help from farmers in Nebraska, in Kansas, and from the many farm, commodity, banking and crop insurance interests that work with producers. They responded with a multitude of ideas, and those ideas form the basis for this bill. 
   The basic structure of the crop insurance program was set out in 1980, and much of that structure remains in place today. 
   Congress last reformed the crop insurance program in 1994, when we created new opportunities for private sector delivery of policies and risk sharing. And our success has been great--more than 181 million acres are enrolled in the program today, up almost 100 million acres since 1993. 
   But we are now seeing participation on the decline. That is cause for concern. 
   And last year, we discovered more cause for concern. Farmers in the northern plains who had been reliable buyers of crop insurance found that it was no longer offering much protection, after repeated years of weather-related disasters. 
   Other farmers across the country made the seemingly improbable decision not to buy a 100 percent subsidized catastrophic policy because they found it worthless--so worthless they wouldn't spend even $50 for the administrative fee. And they then chose not to purchase a buy-up policy, either. 
   And of greatest concern was the inevitable ad hoc disaster program, which Congress had theoretically eliminated in 1994. We spent an additional $6 billion on disaster aid last year in part to make up for these problems. And there are no substantive changes in the program to ward off another disaster bill this year. 
   We will spend at least $18 billion this fiscal year to support agriculture. And the crisis is only deepening.  
   Will this bill fix that crisis? No. Crop insurance 
   does not and can not provide income. If you're getting a check from your insurance company--for your car, or your house, or your farm--you've lost money. 
   But the program today no longer provides even enough support to keep most farmers in business after a couple of loss years. How can it, when most of them have a 35 percent deductible? For a farm operation with $500,000 worth of production, that means the farmer absorbs the first $175,000 of loss. 
   Let me give you an example of how the economics of crop insurance work today. Doug Schmale of Lodgepole, NE, grows about 1,500 acres of wheat on his farm. He's a believer in crop insurance and buys it every year. And now he buys CRC, because he understands that covering revenue is an improvement over just covering yields. 
   Doug says the reason he only buys 65 percent coverage is because, ``That's where it makes the most sense, because that's where the government puts the money. But it's still not adequate.'' 
   Doug is insuring 26 bushels of wheat per acre, which he admits is nowhere close to what he can live on. And since 1987 he's only collected on his insurance policy twice. And he pays about $8,000 a year to buy it, every year. 
   What Doug wants is to buy a 75 percent CRC policy. But if he does that today, his costs will more than double. He'll go from $4.72 an acre to $9.75. And that's not even an option when wheat is only worth $3.00. 
   Doug says that this bill will finally make coverage affordable for him. He'll get enough coverage--at a price he can afford--to stay in business if he has two bad years in a row. 
   There's been a lot of talk about ``safety nets'' over the past few years. And we all know that we wouldn't insure our houses with a 35 percent deductible. But the economics of agriculture say to farmers, ``Underinsure,'' especially now, when every dollar per acre makes an enormous difference. 
   Congress must help change that message. Our message to farmers must be, ``We want you to insure your farm operation for enough coverage that your policy has some value. We want you to be able to take into account crop rotation, new crops and new land. If you have an unbelievable run of bad luck with the weather, we want crop insurance to 
   help you stay in business. 
   ``And we will help you do it.'' 
   Additionally, this bill recognizes that many farmers are trying new crops and in fact other government policies have encouraged them to do so. The crop insurance program offers little option but to underinsure or go without coverage. This bill would required changes in the program to take that into account. 
   And just as importantly, this bill takes a big step toward restructuring the agency that oversees the program. Unbelievably, the statute now makes the board of directors responsible for reporting to the government agency, instead of having the agency report to the Board. We'll put the board of directors at the top of the hierarchy where they belong. 
   By making changes in the administration of the program, we'll come closer to the flexible and responsive risk management program that farmers expect. That may be the most important thing we accomplish. 
   Senator ROBERTS and I have worked together on crop insurance in the past, and we are happy to take the lead again. And I reiterate: this is not the panacea to the financial crisis in rural America, but it is a worthwhile first step. 
   I look forward to a renewed spirit of bipartisanship on ag issues, and we are starting here today. 
   Mr. President, quite simply, this piece of legislation will make crop insurance more affordable, more flexible and more responsive to the changing needs of farmers. That has been our goal from the start, for farmers in Nebraska, farmers in Kansas and farmers throughout the country. 
   The basic structure of the Crop Insurance Program was set in place in 1980. Much of that structure remains in place today. The last time Congress changed the law was in 1994, and at that time we created new opportunities for private sector delivery of policies and risk sharing. It is a model, in my judgment, Mr. President, that has worked. 
   The taxpayers take half the risk; the private sector takes half the risk. They are the ones out selling the product and, as a consequence, there is far less taxpayer exposure than there would be otherwise. Senator ROBERTS just alluded to it. In fact, I think he did more than just allude to it. He said it directly. 
   The ad hoc disaster program we believed we were ending in 1994, when we passed the crop insurance bill, well, it came back last year with a vengeance for $6 billion. It is not a very efficient way of helping businesspeople, family-operated farms that suffer losses. It is a very inefficient way. Typically it costs us a great deal more money and typically it does not benefit the people who need it the most. 
   What crop insurance gives the farmer is a management tool that they can use to manage risk. It is not a replacement for other programs. It is not a replacement for income. It is a tool that they can use to manage the considerable risk of manufacturing a product outside. 
   In 1994, after we created the program, we met with considerable success. We had 181 million acres that were enrolled in the program--that is up from 100 million acres enrolled in 1993--but we are seeing participation rates decline. Last year we discovered more cause for concern when farmers in the northern plains who had been reliable buyers of crop insurance found that it was no longer offering much protection. They were unwilling to buy a 100-percent subsidized catastrophic policy because they found it was worthless. It is only 50 bucks, but they are telling us that it is worthless. 
   Other concerns were expressed by farmers, to both Senator ROBERTS and I, and many other Members of Congress, about how to make this Crop Insurance Program work. We have tried, with this piece of legislation, to do that, by inverting the subsidies, by equalizing the subsidies for revenue insurance, by allowing revenue insurance to be offered for price as well as for yields, by changing the APH for multiyear losses, as well as making changes for farmers that are coming on line for the first time, by allowing livestock to be covered for the first time, a permissive piece, and, most importantly for me, by restructuring the Risk Management Agency itself, making the Risk Management Agency director responsive to the board and bringing on a new private sector entity to evaluate reinsurance and evaluate what, indeed, the market itself wanted to do. 
   Mr. President, I would like to talk specifically about one individual, a man by the name of Doug Schmale from Lodgepole, NE. He grows about 1,500 acres of wheat on his farm. He likes crop insurance. He buys it every year and has bought it since 1987. He has collected but twice. 
   I talked to him about the details. Listen to his details. It is the same thing we are hearing from farmers throughout the country. He buys 65 percent coverage, he said, because ``that's where it makes the most sense, because that's where the Government puts the money. But it's not adequate.'' 
   It doesn't provide him with the protection he needs. That means he will be insuring about 26 bushels an acre, which he admits is nowhere close to what he can produce, nowhere near the kind of losses he would expect if he were to suffer a loss on that crop. 
   What he would like to do is buy a 75 percent crop recovery policy. If he does that, the premiums are so high that, given the price of wheat, he cannot afford to buy it. 
   Again, Mr. President, we are not talking about throwing a bunch of money out here. We are talking about allowing these subsidies to change so the private sector can sell the product easier. I must emphasize this over and over, that what crop insurance represents for the taxpayer is a terrific way to put a product out there to manage risk, because the private sector assumes half the loss. The private sector will suffer a significant loss if there are losses. So they are not going to be out there underwriting policies for things that they consider to be too risky, because they are on the line for half the loss. 
   This piece of legislation represents a substantial step forward. We have pilot projects in there for beginning farmers.  We have pilot projects in there, as well, for many of our southern friends who are concerned that cotton, because it is a lower-cost product, has not been able to get good underwriting. We have tried to accommodate concerns for many other crops as well. 
   We believe that if we can get this legislation passed this year, it will be a giant step forward from what we had in 1994 and will continue us in the direction of saying that we are not going to have ad hoc disaster programs. We are going to allow the farmer himself to have a product that enables him to manage that risk and reduce the risk associated with a rather risky endeavor of production agriculture. 
   I don't know if the Senator from Kansas has anymore enlightened, humorous remarks to make. I wonder if the Senator from Kansas will agree that what we saw after we passed the law in 1994 was a substantial increase in the number of acres that are covered, and the program is working, but we have kind of hit a wall. We reformed it considerably. We are moving more toward the market, but we have hit a wall. 
   The market is basically saying, ``We have products that we can sell; our farmers will buy the products.'' But here are changes we need to make in this law and if you make these changes, we think you will find more acreage is underwritten, more satisfied customers and less need for ad hoc disaster, as a consequence.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I appreciate that growing list of cosponsors. I hope this is a piece of legislation which we can persuade our friends on the Budget Committee to make room for. It will save us money in the long term. It will save us and prevent us from spending multibillions of dollars a year on ad hoc disaster assistance in some kind of a supplemental appropriation. I hope very much that we are able to get some additional room. 
   I was disappointed we did not see it in the President's budget. He has a lot of new spending priorities. I think if we put this a bit ahead of some of the spending priorities, we ought to make room for it. 
   I promise my colleagues, if we do that, if we change the law in this way, you will find we will be saving money in the long term trying to make certain that family-based agriculture, one of the most important parts of our economy, still producing this year at least $20 billion worth of surplus in trade--it is going to be down a it in 1999, but it is still an enormously important part of our economy--I assure my colleagues if we get room in our budget to include the cost of this expansion of crop insurance that it will save us money in the long term.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Ed-Flex bill introduced by Senators FRIST and WYDEN. I believe it is a responsible way to help our nation's educators meet the challenges that we face in preparing our nation's young people for the 21st century. 
   Ed-Flex gives states the authority to grant waivers of certain Federal requirements to local school districts if such a waiver will help that school district better meet the needs of its students. But in exchange for this flexibility, the local school district must show results. If the district does not show results, the waiver is revoked. Ed-Flex gives school districts flexibility, but it also demands accountability--and we should discuss how to make the accountability measures even stronger. 
   In addition, under Ed-Flex states are limited in the kinds of requirements they are authorized to waive. They cannot waive health and safety requirements or civil rights requirements. And they cannot deny districts the funds they would ordinarily receive under these Federal programs. Furthermore, districts must prove that the waiver they receive truly helps them accomplish the goal it is designed to meet: helping more students learn better. 
   In Nebraska we have 604 public school districts. They range in size from the small rural districts such as Tryon--which has just over 100 students, kindergarten through 12th grade--and Omaha, which has approximately 45,000 students. 
   A couple of weeks ago I was visited by Bob Ridenour, principal of North Ward and West Ward Elementary Schools in McCook, Nebraska. In response to the question, What do you need to do a better job of educating your kids?'' his answer was simple: More money and the flexibility to help the kids at the lowest end of the economic scale in the best way possible. 
   But Ed-Flex is not just about flexibility. It's also about better coordination. It allows for better coordination between the variety of local, state, and Federal education programs available to schools. 
   All of the principals in Nebraska would agree that the Federal education dollars they receive are vital to well-being and success of the school children within that district. But different districts have different needs. And in some instances, different districts may need to take slightly different paths to reach the common goal that all districts share: Making sure that all students have the reading, math, and social skills to succeed once they leave the schoolhouse door. 
   Right now, 12 States have Ed-Flex. And the feedback we have shows that they are using it responsibly and that it is showing good results. Texas has implemented Ed-Flex more extensively than any other state in the nation. Achievement scores in Texas reveal that districts with waivers outperformed districts without waivers in both reading and math. And the gains for African American students were even greater. 
   And Ed-Flex has allowed States like Massachusetts to assure continuity of service to schools that were eligible for title I funding one year, ineligible the next year, but expect to be eligible in the following year. In the grand scheme of things, this is a minor waiver. But to a child in that school, the assistance provided through title I dollars makes a major difference. 
   Now let me be clear. Ed-Flex is a sound way to give local districts the flexibility they need to do a good job of educating students. But it's only one part of a complex puzzle. 
   Schools also need resources. They need to have the funds to hire and train qualified teachers. They need to have the ability to reduce class sizes in the lower grades. They need to be able to provide students with real classrooms in well-equipped buildings. 
   And schools need to be able to provide challenging afterschool programs  so that students can work on their math, science, reading, and technology skills between the hours of 3:00 and 6:00 in the afternoon. 
   Last summer we helped US West form a partnership with Project Banneker, a program that is helping raise the math and science achievement levels in Omaha Public Schools. Not only did students and teachers benefit from the hands-on technology skills training, but US West benefited because they played a role in training prospective employees. We are looking forward to another productive summer with US West as we work to expand the partnership. 
   The Federal government can't do it all--and the Federal government should not do it all. But we should be a helpful partner in the effort to improve our nation's schools. The Federal contribution to K-12 education is relatively small--less than 10 percent. That is why it's important that we make sure our investments in education are wise ones, that they complement efforts at the state and local levels, and that the investments yield results. 
   We need to make sure that the most disadvantaged students have the assistance and resources that they need to succeed in school. We need to continue to invest in title I, and also figure out how to make it stronger. Nebraska received $31 million year in title I funds last year. School districts use those funds in a variety of ways. We need to give districts the flexibility to educate those students using the best methods available, but we also must demand accountability. 
   I believe that the most important way in which the Federal Government can be a helpful partner is by making sure that when a young person finishes twelfth grade he or she has the skills to get a decent job. It may take a couple of years at a community college to fine-tune those skills, but the point is that only 60% of high school graduates nationwide go on to college, and by the time they are 25 years old, only about 25% have a college degree. 
   Now we need to do more to make higher education more affordable, and we just passed a Higher Education Act that makes significant steps toward that goal. But we also have to make sure that those who do not pursue a postsecondary degree have the skills to make a good living. 
   That's why I believe strongly in the value of vocational education. Two weeks ago I visited the vocational education program at Grand Island High School, in Grand Island, Nebraska. In the vocational education program at Grand Island High, students are receiving hands-on education that will translate into real jobs. Grand Island has formed a partnership with area manufacturers, and the manufacturers know that it's a good deal for them. They have said to Grand Island, You train the students, and there will be a job waiting for them when they get out of school.'' 
   In one particular class students work together all year long to build an actual house. Every part of the house, with the exception of the foundation, is built by the students. Then, at the end of the year, they actually sell the house, taking pride in the fact that they have created a product that has tangible value to their community. 
   Mr. President, I believe we need to increase opportunities for these students. I support the Ed-Flex bill because I believe that if it is used wisely it can help schools accomplish important goals in educating students. But I want to make clear that it's just the tip of the iceberg. We also need to increase our investment in these students so that all students have a shot at the American Dream. 
   Mr. President, just briefly, I thank both the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from Massachusetts for their leadership on this as well. I want to try to briefly declare why I like this bill and what I think needs to be done in addition to it. 
   I had a recent conversation with one of the 604 school superintendents in Nebraska. Those schools are as small as 100 students, ranging all the way up to 46,000 students, with a lot of variation in between. I talked to a superintendent in one of the rural school districts--in my State there is more poverty in the rural areas than is in the urban areas among children--and asked what he wanted. He said, immediately, ``I need, in some cases, more flexibility to implement programs. I do not want any waivers from civil rights requirements, no waivers from health or safety. But sometimes with a Federal program, the State won't allow me to do what would reasonably accomplish the objective of what the Feds want.'' This bill allows it. He said, ``In fact, I would like to be held to even higher standards of accountability. I want you all to hold me accountable to make certain that we are getting the job done.'' This bill does that. It provides both flexibility and measures for increased accountability, which is precisely what we need. 
   I want to point out as well, Mr. President, that he went on to say that the greatest challenge is not only flexibility, but increased resources for those children of lower income working families in both rural and urban environments. He said, ``If you are insistent upon making certain that we have trade policies that are open, and if you want to keep the restrictions on business to a minimum so entrepreneurs can grow, what we are going to have to do is aggressively increase the skills of people that leave high school and go right into the workforce.'' The only way to get that done is to start very early. And I hope that in this bill, Mr. President, that we will have an opportunity to put some amendments on it that will give us some increased funding for lowering class size, that will allow us to do some afterschool programs. 
   I know the Senator from Connecticut has a bill dealing with child care. To me, child care and education are almost interchangeable. It is difficult to tell one from the other. A full third of my high school students in Nebraska go immediately from high school into the workforce, and there is an increasing amount of concern at the rural level and at the community level for the skills of these young people. If you do not start it early, it is impossible for us to close that skills gap. In my judgment, with the pace of our economy and the speed with which things are changing, there is a real urgency to get out there with flexibility, which this bill does. I hope we will have the opportunity to provide some additional resources so we can make sure that, with confidence, we are saying we are doing all we can to make sure that our young people, when they graduate from high school, are prepared and have the skills that they are going to need in a very competitive world economy. 
   Mr. President, I thank the manager of the bill, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning S. 314. I am pleased that the Senate took a step forward today to help small businesses prepare for the Year 2000 Problem. I am very concerned about Y2K's potential affect on small businesses and rural communities, particularly in my home state of Nebraska where technology is increasingly playing a vital role in all aspects of commerce. In addition to the many small businesses that use technology in everyday transactions, Nebraska is home to a growing high-technology industry that could be derailed if we fail to take additional steps to solve the Year 2000 problem. 
   High-technology companies account for a significant portion of Nebraska's economic output. According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, forty-four of every one-thousand private sector workers in Nebraska are employed by high-tech firms at an average salary of $37,000. Astonishingly, that's nearly $15,000 more than the average private sector wage. 
   This rapidly growing sector of Nebraska's economy is a testament to the ingenuity and work ethic that characterize the citizens of our state. From the data processing industry in Omaha to the telecommunications and technology interests in Lincoln to electronic retail commerce and agribusiness interests in the panhandle, Nebraskans are using and developing unique technologies to improve their lives. It's clear that the information age has arrived on the plains as nearly one-fourth of Nebraska's exports come through high-tech trade. 
   Currently, Nebraska ranks 32nd in high-tech employment and 38th in high-tech average wage. The hard work of community leaders across the state has encouraged new technology companies to put down roots in Nebraska. One of my top priorities is fostering the continued development of advanced communications networks and providing Nebraska's kids with the math, science and technology skills they need to become productive members of this industry. Telemedicine, distance learning and other telecommunications services offer exciting new possibilities for our businesses, schools and labor force. I mention these successes, to underscore how important technology has become not only to Nebraska's economy but to the nation's economy.

    Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, now that the Senate has passed the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999, I would like to take a few moments to express my appreciation for a group of dedicated Nebraskans who have chosen to serve their country in the Nebraska Army National Guard. 
   Most of the fifty-nine members of the Nebraska Army National Guard's 24th Medical Company left Lincoln on February 21st, for Fort Benning, Georgia. This week, having completed some additional training, these soldiers from the Nebraska Guard are traveling, along with five of the unit's UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters, to participate in Operation Joint Forge in Bosnia, where they are scheduled to serve up to 270 days overseas. The 24th Medical Company will be only the second air medical evacuation unit deployed to Bosnia, where their mission will be to care for casualties as they are flown from the front lines to hospitals. 
   Earlier this month, I visited with members of the medical unit in their hangar in Lincoln, Nebraska. Mr. President, I am very impressed by the dedication and training of these fine individuals. We are increasingly calling upon our nation's Reserve units to provide support for missions such as Bosnia, as part of America's down-sized military. Unlike the active duty forces, the citizen soldier puts a uniform on, serves his or her country, takes the uniform off, and goes back to work. We Americans should not take this dedication for granted. This current deployment may last for nine months, and that is nine months of time away from their families, their jobs, their education, and their lives. They realize the importance of their mission, and they are willing to make the sacrifices such a mission entails. 
   Mr. President, I am encouraged by last week's vote in this chamber to increase base pay and benefits for our military forces. The men and women who dedicate their lives to keeping our nation safe need and deserve a pay raise. The decision to join the military is extraordinary, and those who do so need to be properly compensated. However, money has never been and never will be the motivating factor for people who wish to join the Armed Services. We must ensure that the soldiers in our military are not driven away from service by a poor quality-of-life standard. We can accomplish this by making sure that our military have adequate housing, a good, responsive medical care system, proper training and equipment, and support for their families. Even more importantly, we who are not actively involved in military service must continue to hold up individuals such as the 24th Company as exemplars of service and sacrifice in our country. Theirs are the stories that need to be told. 
   In closing, I would like to give a personal ``Thank you'' to each and every one of the fifty-nine members of the Nebraska Army National Guard's 24th Medical Company. I wish you success in your journey and look forward to your return from what is the noblest mission in the Army, the mission to save lives.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to join Chairman SHELBY in recommending to the Senate that Mr. James M. Simon be confirmed as the new Assistant Director of Central Intelligence for Administration. Mr. Simon has demonstrated the essential qualities required for this position, and I believe the Director of Central Intelligence has acted wisely in proposing to the President Mr. Simon's nomination. 
   I am glad the Director of Central Intelligence is fulfilling one of the obligations imposed by the Fiscal Year 1997 Intelligence Authorization Act. In that Act, Congress--after extended discussions among the relevant committees--created a new management structure for the Office of the DCI. That structure included the new positions of Assistant Directors of Central Intelligence--one for intelligence collection, one for intelligence analysis, and one for community administration. The nomination to be considered by the Senate, the Assistant Director for Administration, will help to play an important role in ensuring the Intelligence Community is effectively managed. 
   To date, the DCI has taken the interim steps of appointing acting Assistant Directors for collection and for analysis. I expect Presidential nominations for these positions will be forthcoming soon. I must say, the Senate's wisdom in the Fiscal Year 1997 Intelligence Authorization Act has been confirmed by the DCI's interim appointments. Prior to the appointments of Mr. Charles Allen and Mr. John Gannon, Congress and the American people looked to the DCI to manage both the collection of intelligence information and the analysis of that information. Without any assistance in these areas, it was literally his personal responsibility. When the intelligence community fails to collect adequate information to prevent policy-makers from being surprised, Congress and the American people blame the DCI. Further, when the intelligence community fails to marshal its resources to analyze tough intelligence targets, Congress and the American people again blame the DCI. The blame was clear, for example, in last year's Indian nuclear test incident. Affixing the responsibility on the DCI was warranted, but he did not have the management structure in place to help him fulfill his responsibilities. The Fiscal Year 1997 Intelligence Authorization Act created a structure to help the DCI discharge his responsibilities and, following the Indian nuclear tests, the DCI began filling the new structure. So far, the results of Mr. Allen's and Mr. Gannon's work demonstrate that community-wide coordination is appropriate and sorely needed. 
   Mr. Simon is eminently qualified. He is a career intelligence officer. He has demonstrated throughout his career the ability to make tough calls and to be held accountable for those calls. In his most recent assignment as the head of the CIA's Requirements Evaluation Staff, he has taken on a task to fix something that has long been broken. He is working on a way to place a value on the different kinds of intelligence we collect. To the uninitiated this may sound fairly unimportant and, perhaps, even easy. But is not. It is hard because it directly challenges the directors of the heads of the agencies within the Intelligence Community. For example, it forces the head of signals intelligence to justify the quality of his efforts relative to the efforts of another agency that controls human intelligence. It has a similar effect on judging the value of satellite collection relative to the other ways we obtain  our intelligence information. No agency director likes this evaluation because it forces questions to be answered on such fundamental issues as to whether or not community-wide budget and personnel resources are being directed in the right areas. Directors naturally resist a comparison of the value of their agency's work versus the value of the work of other agencies. Nonetheless, Mr. Simon chose to take on the agency heads in the Intelligence Community because it was the right thing to do. 
   The DCI has made an excellent choice in recommending Mr. Simon to the President. Mr. Simon should be confirmed by the Senate. I believe his services as the Assistant Director of Central Intelligence for Administration will have a significant and lasting impact on the Intelligence Community. I urge my colleagues to support this nomination.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, on the heels of passing a much-needed pay and benefits increase for the men and women who give up their freedom to serve us in our armed services, I want to direct my colleagues' attention to one longstanding military mission these men and women have been assigned. That is the mission of containing the threat of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. 
   Mr. President, I do this for a couple of reasons. First is that I have argued for a stronger military operation in Iraq. Indeed, I have argued to change the objective from containment to replacement. And oftentimes people come back and say, well, if we do that, we will risk lives. 
   I would like to describe to my colleagues--in fact, we have a military operation going on today, have had since 1991; and this military operation is costing us dearly both in lives and in money. 
   Mr. President, last Tuesday I had the opportunity to give a speech to the cadets at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs and they asked me to speak on patriotism, for which I was only too anxious to oblige. 
   I talked to them about something that I think is causing the decline in enrollment--in addition to the inadequate pay and retirement benefits--and that is that Americans are less willing to volunteer for service in our Armed Forces as a consequence, in my judgment, of our not doing enough to tell them --especially our younger citizens--the stories of heroism which are being written every single day by the brave men and women who wear the uniform of one of our services. Instead of role models of people who have given themselves to a higher cause, Mr. President, unfortunately our young people are being told an increasing number of stories, especially on television, of self-gratification and indulgency. 
   It is no wonder as a consequence that a patriotic decision to serve seems like a nonmainstream choice. 
   Before I gave my speech at the Academy, the superintendent warned me I needed to remember how young my audience was. ``Half your audience,'' he said, ``wasn't even 10 years of age when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990.'' Mr. President, I must tell you that gave me some pause because that seemed like yesterday that happened, but, in fact, a great deal of time has expired since then. 
   For me, the statement was more than just a reminder to be careful what language I used when talking to these young people, but also a wakeup call not to take for granted the military mission that we have in place in Iraq today. It is a dangerous military operation. It is a military operation that costs us a great deal of money, and I hazard a guess that most of us who have looked at the objective of containing Saddam Hussein would say that the mission is dangerously close to unraveling. 
   This military strategy began in August 1990 when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. In response to this active aggression, the United States, under President Bush's leadership, assembled and led an international coalition of forces against Iraq. It was a costly war, both in terms of our financial commitment but also in terms of the human cost to the more than 540,000 men and women in our military forces deployed to the Persian Gulf. Sixty billion dollars was spent prosecuting the war, but this does not compare to the price paid by 389 American families who lost loved ones in Operation Desert Storm. 
   At the end of the war, most Americans assumed our military commitment to Iraq would come to an end. After all, the war had been fought. We had been victorious. Saddam Hussein had sued for peace. It was time to bring home the troops. But almost from the beginning, Saddam Hussein refused to abide by the terms of the cease-fire agreements his government had signed. From violating the no-fly zones to obstructing the work of weapons inspectors to provoking troop deployments, Iraq's continual challenges and our policy of containment forced us to maintain a very strong military presence in the region. With each crisis generated by the Iraqi regime, the United States and our allies responded to the deployment of more troops and at times with the use of military force. While it is difficult to quantify the monetary cost of the numerous redeployments and military confrontations that have taken place with Iraq over the last 8 years, it is even more difficult to quantify the effect these deployments have had on our troops. How many families have had to be separated for months at a time? What has been the cost in morale for troops deployed to the Desert? 
   We must also examine the broader costs of our military strategy in Iraq. The continual need for large numbers of American troops in Saudi Arabia has created a strong sense of resentment throughout the Arab world, and it has also increased the danger of terrorist acts against Americans. 
   Again, I have urged a different military strategy with a different objective  in the past. The reason I bring this story to the floor, Mr. President, is oftentimes people will say, ``Americans don't want to risk the lives of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines in a military operation.'' In 1996, 19 Americans were killed in the Khobar Towers bombing and they died as a result of the anger directed at the American military presence in the gulf. Indeed, the terrorist bombings of U.S. Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, in which 12 Americans were killed, were directed by Osama bin Laden, a man who had been stripped of his Saudi citizenship for financing Islamic militants in Algeria, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. Today, bin Laden remains at large and remains a significant threat not just to people of the world but especially to American citizens around the world. The reason he is a threat and the reason he has killed not just Americans but Kenyans is we are deploying a military operation in Saudi Arabia. It is our presence that he objects to. It is our presence and our military strategy that is being met with his terrorist activities. 
   Again, I raise these points because I think we have a tendency to forget the price that we paid for our policy in Iraq. We forget the price that we are paying today for our policy in Iraq. This policy has been described as containment. It has been expensive and, in my judgment, it has failed. Recent events may indicate that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. The Iraqi people may be closer to their freedom than at any time in years. America must be prepared for sudden change in that country. 
   The Iraqi people are suffering. The Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein is among the most brutal and repressive in the world. Americans can be proud of the leading role we are playing in confronting this dictatorship. Last fall President Clinton and Congress took a big step towards delegitimizing Saddam by passing and signing the Iraqi Liberation Act. The world was placed on notice that America wanted to see Saddam's dictatorship gone and would work with democratic opposition groups to attain that goal. 
   The administration and our British allies took another big step in December with the Desert Fox airstrikes. By attacking 
   the underpinnings of Saddam's power, the Special Republican Guards and the intelligence services, Operation Desert Fox reduced Saddam's ability to terrorize his people and showed Iraqis we and our allies were truly opposed to Saddam in a way previous air campaigns had not done. 
   Saddam responded to Desert Fox by undertaking regular violations of the northern and southern no-fly zones, trying to entice allied aircraft into air defense missile ambushes. The allied counter has been highly effective. Rather than simply chasing retreating Iraqi aircraft, United States and allied warplanes have been attacking the Iraqi air defense missile and radar and communication sites, which would support such ambushes. Almost every day so far in 1999 we have attacked some Iraqi air defense installation in response to a no-fly zone violation. The effectiveness and readiness of Saddam's air defense forces decline daily. Equally important, the complete impotence of Saddam's military relative to the allies is made plain to all Iraqis. In military terms, the Iraqi regime has never looked weaker. 
   Last weekend, the world saw signs of a political rally to match the decline of Iraq's military. The Grand Ayatollah of the Shiites, the spiritual leader of 65 percent of Iraqis who are Shiite Muslims, was murdered Thursday night with two of his sons. According to press reports, the Grand Ayatollah had reportedly opposed the regime's directive to all Muslims that they pray at home rather than at Friday services in mosques. Opposition sources said the Grand Ayatollah had preached against the regime and had blamed it for the misery of Iraqis. Perhaps for these reasons, Shiite Muslim Iraqis suspected the government of the crime and took to the streets in Baghdad and in several southern cities. 
   The Iraqi opposition groups claim scores, perhaps hundreds, of Iraqis were killed in the government's harsh response. Two other Shiite leaders of international reputation have also been mysteriously murdered in southern Iraq within the last year. The murder of the Grand Ayatollah, coming on these earlier murders and in the background of longstanding Shiite resistance to Saddam's regime, sparked demonstrations and violent government responses in Baghdad and several other cities, according to opposition reports. By Sunday night, the regime had apparently quelled the demonstrations. The human cost and the extent of continuing Shiite hostility to Saddam's regime are simply not known to us, but the episode demonstrates the Iraqi government's lack of legitimacy in the eyes of its people, as well as the extent to which Saddam would go to suppress any opposition. The episode reveals a weakening Iraqi regime lashing out in an increasingly desperate effort to maintain power. When dictatorships act this way, it may signal that their end is near. 
   But when the end comes, it may come quickly. The question will be, Is America prepared for the end? If we have done our homework on the various Iraqi opposition groups and actively supported the groups which qualify under the criteria set forth in the Iraq Liberation Act, we will be well positioned to help Iraq make the transition to democracy. However, if we delay full implementation of the act and take a wait-and-see posture toward the opposition, we should not be surprised if our influence on events in post-Saddam Iraq is slight. Similarly, if we do not have humanitarian supplies ready to be forwarded to Iraq as soon as Saddam falls, and if we do not have international consensus for forgiving the debts of a post-Saddam Iraq, we should not be surprised to see him replaced by another hostile dictator. 
   Mr. President, we have a vital national interest in Iraq's future. The lives of young Americans are invested there--our honored dead from the gulf war, as well as from the terrorist attack on Khobar Towers. The valor of our young warriors--now being demonstrated daily in the skies over Iraq--is invested there. 
   Tens of thousands of soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines have spent months of their lives on deployments to the Persian Gulf and to Turkey in support of the U.S. policy to contain Iraq. We have invested billions of dollars supporting this policy: $1.36 billion on deployments in fiscal year 1998 alone, and $800 million so far in fiscal year 1999. 
   The American people have made this heavy investment and they have the right to a good return--a democratic Iraq at peace with its neighbors and with its people, so we can bring our troops, ships, and planes home for good. To attain this return, we must be ready for an internal crisis in Iraq, which could occur sooner than we expect. 
   Mr. President, on later occasions, I intend to come to the floor to describe why I believe a policy other than containment is necessary. I understand there are people who are very suspicious and very guarded in their assessments of our success. But I ask them merely to look at previous examples of where the United States of America has been successful in the face of considerable skepticism about our ability to get that done. 
   In addition, Mr. President, we have, as I have tried to outline here, a considerable military investment and a risky operation going on today that puts every single one of these men and women, their health, safety, and well-being at risk, and we should not and dare not take that for granted. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I welcome a discussion in the Senate about military pay and retirement benefits. Review of these and other quality of life issues in today's military is long overdue. The defense debate in recent years has centered on equipment procurement, readiness issues, and the wisdom of our nation's troop deployments and foreign policy. This year we should turn to consider the men and women who dedicate their lives to keeping our nation safe. 
   Military service requires valor and sacrifice. It attracts a certain type of individual, a person with the character to lead, the resolve to complete a task however difficult and demanding, and the willingness to sacrifice his or her life for fellow soldiers and country. For those reasons, the decision to join the military has always been unlike the decision to join any other profession. 
   The unparalleled strength of our economy in recent years, and the growth of new technologies and industries, further complicate the decision to serve in the military. Just as our society has entered a new age of technological change, the United States Military has also entered a new era of digital warfare, where the machinery of battle is more reliant upon silicon chips than hard steel. To keep these processors and equipment running, our military needs to attract and retain highly skilled, intelligent men and women. 
   Today, our Defense Department must also compete for recruits with Microsoft and Price Waterhouse Coopers as well as companies in more traditional industries. The Defense Department cannot do that by offering a second-tier pay scale which lags significantly behind the private sector. If we want the best and the brightest, we have to be willing to pay them accordingly. 
   I welcome the Administration's decisions to increase military pay by 4.4% and to renew the retirement program that offers benefits of fifty percent military pay for twenty years service. These policies seek to restore equity in compensation for military personnel, and properly reward those who have committed twenty years of their lives to protect our nation. Yet, I do not believe the Administration's military pay proposal goes far enough to resolve the inequity. Therefore, I support S. 4, the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999, because this legislation does more to provide financial security to our uniformed men and women. 
   My colleagues understand that the nature of pay and benefits in the United States military is unlike pay considerations within our private sector and compensation practices in other nations' militaries. Within our private sector, the issue of compensation is the primary focus for the vast majority of Americans when deciding between competing job offers. In other nations that lack strong democratic principles and a tradition of rule of law, foreign leaders use relatively high pay for soldiers to assure military support for their government. 
   But in the United States, pay is not the primary reason people join the military. Some join for the experience of military service, for the mental and physical challenges that our Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines place upon young men and women, and the sense of accomplishment that comes from meeting those challenges. Some join as a means to an education, to partake of the G.I. Bill and other post-service education benefits. Yet, while not always the primary motivating factor, the men and women who serve our country always do so out of a sense of patriotism. They choose to commit the time and effort of their youth, join organizations with unique cultures distinct from contemporary institutions, forego at least temporarily the chance for greater wealth, and risk physical harm and possibly death, to repay our nation for the freedoms and opportunities they as citizens enjoy. 
   Money never has been and never will be the primary deciding factor for people seeking to join, or deciding whether to stay, in the U.S. military. But, on the margin--the always important margin--the size of a military paycheck does make a difference. S. 4 may not fully correct the deficiency in military pay, but it is at least a significant step along the way. 
   I understand the concerns raised by many of my colleagues about the budgetary ramifications of this bill. S. 4 provides a rise in pay of 4.8% for fiscal year 2000, a substantial increase from the Administration's proposed 4.4% pay raise. Either of these increases will have ramifications on military procurement, on research and development, on operations and maintenance accounts that support readiness, and other areas of the defense budget as well. Similarly, S. 4 provides a pay raise for fiscal year 2001 and beyond of one percent above the level of the Employment Cost Index. This is a statutory commitment whose cost we cannot today determine with any suitable degree of accuracy. While we may decide to accept these increases, the consequences of these policies need to be reviewed and resolved within the context of the entire defense budget. 
   Also, there are currently three studies underway examining military pay and pension issues, conducted by the Congressional Budget Office, the General Accounting Office, and the Department of Defense. These studies are examining how factors other than pay such as high operations tempo, lack of essential material and equipment, declining state of readiness, concern over military health care services, job dissatisfaction, and a booming civilian economy may affect the decision to join and remain in the military. Once we receive the conclusions and recommendations of these studies, we should again revisit the issues surrounding military retention and recruitment. 
   Already, as a consequence of amendments which have been attached to this bill, the Senate has accepted an unfunded liability of approximately $16.5 billion. Currently, there are no offsets in the legislation to address this liability. It is my sincere desire that this issue is addressed and offsets are determined when the bill goes into conference with the House. If these costs remain outstanding when the bill returns to the Senate, I will have strong reservations about voting for unfunded liabilities a second time. The tight caps and fiscal discipline I have supported throughout this decade do not start creating real on-budget surpluses until FY2001. This year's surplus is created entirely by excess payroll taxes and interest on the Social Security Trust Funds. So I am concerned that the Senate is considering legislation that may bust the cap so early in the legislative season. I encourage my colleagues to maintain our recent tradition of fiscal discipline and seek ways to pay for this bill within the current budget caps.  
   Nevertheless, our military is only as secure as the people that operate the guns, ships, planes, and terminals that help keep our nation safe. The men and women in our Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines are the strength of our military, not the equipment which they utilize. If providing some level of monetary security to our military personnel means we must forsake some weapons or postpone some research, I believe this tradeoff will actually enhance our national security far more than the alternative.

    Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, last year, Senator GORTON and I introduced a bill that addressed a growing problem faced by local governments in the new era of state electric utility restructuring. That bill had the bipartisan co-sponsorship of almost a dozen Senators. 
   On February 6, we reintroduced this legislation as the Bond Fairness and Protection Act. This bill will ensure Nebraskans continue to benefit from the publicly-owned power they currently receive. Nebraska has 154 not-for-profit community-based public power systems. It is the only state which relies entirely on public power for electricity. This system has served my state well as Nebraskans enjoy some of the lowest rates in the nation. 
   Approximately 18 states have already moved toward permitting new competition in the electric industry. However, the federal tax rules governing municipal bond financing did not anticipate the new era of electric utility restructuring when they were crafted more than a decade ago. If Congress does not act, public power systems that open their transmission lines to privately owned utilities can jeopardize the status of their outstanding tax-exempt bonds. The legislation my colleagues and I introduced is an equitable solution to the problem. 
   Under this legislation, local governments determine how their future municipal power debt will be treated. According to the US Department of Energy, my own state had over $2.2 billion in outstanding municipal power bond debt in 1996. Our bill protects local governments that issued public power bond debt in the past, yet gives them the flexibility to issue new, but fully taxable debt if they choose to build any new power generation facilities in the future. 
   Specifically, our legislation provides them with an option: they may either choose to operate under current, so called ``private use'' rules in our tax code. Or if they prefer, they can choose to make a one-time irrevocable election that will allow them to build new power generation facilities if they want, but only using fully taxable bonds instead of tax-exempt financing. 
   It is important we recognize and respect local governments may face unique situations in public power financing issues as the electricity market changes, and we give them reasonable and fair choices. 
   Congress may or may not choose to move forward this year on the larger and more complex issues involved in restructuring the electricity marketplace. But I feel we must act to solve this special problem this year. Our local governments should not face unfair retroactive bond taxation triggered by old federal tax rules in conflict with the new state-mandated laws or regulations. 
   This legislation weighs the interests of local governments, bondholders, consumers, and public and private utilities. It will enable Nebraska public power systems to make decisions in the best interests of their consumers and protect the reliable, affordable electric service that Nebraska currently enjoys.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, in the impeachment case of President Clinton I have read the depositions, reviewed the massive volume of evidence and carefully followed the detailed presentations of both the House managers and the President's counsel. The instructions for my decision come from two places: the oath I took to do impartial justice and the Constitution of the United States. 
   Nebraskans, including me, are angry about the President's behavior. We find it deplorable on every level. It has permanently and deservedly marred his place in history. But impeachment is not about punishing an individual; it is about protecting the country. We punish a President who behaves immorally, lies and otherwise lacks the character we demand in public office with our votes. Presidents are also subject to criminal prosecution when they leave office.  
   Impeachment must be reserved for extreme situations involving crimes against the state. Why? Because the founders of our country and the framers of our Constitution correctly placed stability of the republic as their paramount concern. They did not want Congress to be able to easily remove a popularly elected President. They made clear they intended a decision to impeach to be used to protect the nation against only the highest of crimes. 
   On December 19, 1998, the House of Representatives, on an almost straight party-line vote, approved and delivered to the Senate two articles of impeachment. The Constitution permits me to judge and decide upon only these articles, not to wander through all of the President's conduct looking for any reason for removal. 
   Some Nebraskans have told me the President should be removed from office by the Congress because he is no longer trusted, has lost the respect of many, and has displayed reprehensible behavior. As strong as those feelings are, the Constitution does not provide for overturning an election even if all of these things are true. 
   Three recent letters to the editor in the Omaha World-Herald help make the point. The first, from a man in Kearney, says that by voting to dismiss the trial, I ``voted to support sexual harassment,'' among other things. A second, from Honey Creek, Iowa, raises allegations regarding the President and China, says he is ``dangerous'' and urges Senator HAGEL and I to ``oust him now.'' The third, from Omaha, reminds readers of an often quoted comment I once made about the President's credibility and asks how, in light of that, I could vote to leave him in office. 
   However, the House did not charge the President with these offenses. Impeachment is not a judgment of a President's character, all his actions, or even his general fitness for office. We make those decisions every four years at the ballot box. Our job in contemplating the extraordinary step of overturning an election is to judge only those charges the House actually brought. 
   Because the premium on Constitutional stability is so high, I decided to judge the case against the strictest possible standard: proof beyond a reasonable doubt. In other words, the President can be convicted only if there is no reasonable interpretation of the facts other than an intent to commit perjury and obstruction of justice. The following is a summary of my analysis of this case: 
   Article One accuses the President of perjury in his August 17, 1998, testimony to a Federal grand jury, during which he waived his rights against self incrimination. Most important in determining guilt or innocence is the rule of law governing perjury, which makes it clear that a person has not committed perjury just because they misled or even lied. Perjury occurs when a false statement is made under oath with willful intent to mislead in a material matter. Lying is immoral; perjury is illegal. I should not accuse the President of ignoring the rule of law and then ignore it myself in making a judgment. 
   After reading and watching the President's grand jury testimony, listening to the arguments of the House managers and the President's lawyers, discussing this case with prosecutors and reviewing the impeachment trial of U.S. District Judge ALCEE HASTINGS, I have concluded the President did not commit the crime of perjury beyond a reasonable doubt. I frequently found the President's testimony maddening and misleading, but I did not find it material to a criminal act. 
   Article Two accuses the President of obstructing justice in seven instances. The House managers relied on circumstantial evidence, saying that common sense provides only one conclusion about why the President acted the way he did. However, the direct evidence, including the testimony of Monica Lewinsky herself, rebutted the circumstantial evidence. Second, while the House managers were correct in saying that common sense could lead to a conclusion that the President intended to obstruct justice, common sense could also lead to other reasonable conclusions about the reasons for his actions. Third, with respect to the allegations of obstructing justice in the civil case, Paula Jones' lawsuit was thrown out, then eventually settled. In the end, justice was done. 
   As reprehensible as I find the President's behavior to be, I do not believe that high crimes and misdemeanors as defined by the Framers have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I will vote to acquit on both Articles. My vote to acquit is not a vote to exonerate. While there is plenty of blame to go around in this case, the person most responsible for it going this far is the President of the United States. He behaved immorally, recklessly and reprehensibly. These were his choices. In the final analysis, they do not merit removal, but they do merit condemnation. 
   While I am confident this vote is the right one--not just for this case, but as a precedent for future Congresses and Presidents too--I understand that reasonable people could reach the opposite conclusion. The bitterness in America on both sides of this debate has saddened me. I hope and pray that with this vote behind us the people's Congress can return without rancor to the important work of our country.

    Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this proposal to provide critical support to teaching programs at free-standing children's hospitals. I am also honored to be joined by Senators BOND, KENNEDY, DURBIN, DEWINE, MOYNIHAN, GRAHAM, GORTON, INOUYE, MACK, and MURRAY as original cosponsors. And I am gratified to note that the President's budget submission for FY 2000 also includes funding for teaching programs at these hospitals. 
   Children's hospitals play an important role in our nation's health care system. They combine high-quality clinical care, a vibrant teaching mission and leading pediatric biomedical research within their walls. They provide specialized regional services, including complex care to chronically ill children, and serve as safety-net providers to low-income children. 
   Teaching is an inherent component of these hospitals' day-to-day operations. These hospitals train twenty-nine percent of the nation's pediatricians, and the majority of America's pediatric specialists. Pediatric residents develop the skills they need to care for our nation's children at these institutions. 
   In addition, these hospitals effectively combine the joint missions of teaching and research. Scientific discovery depends on the strong academic focus of teaching hospitals. The teaching environment attracts academics devoted to research. It attracts the volume and spectrum of complex cases needed for clinical research. And the teaching mission creates the intellectual environment necessary to test the conventional wisdom of day-to-day health care and foster the questioning that leads to breakthroughs in research. Because these hospitals combine research and teaching in a clinical setting, these breakthroughs can be rapidly translated into patient care. 
   Children's hospitals have contributed to advances in virtually every aspect of pediatric medicine. Thanks to research efforts at these hospitals, children can survive once-fatal diseases such as polio, grow and thrive with disabilities such as cerebral palsy, and overcome juvenile diabetes to become self-supporting adults. 
   Through patient care, teaching and research, these hospitals contribute to our communities in many ways. However, their training programs--and their ability to fulfill their critical role in America's health care system--are being gradually undermined by dwindling financial support. Maintaining a vibrant teaching and research program is more expensive than simply providing patient care. The nation's teaching hospitals have historically relied on additional support--support beyond the cost of clinical care itself--in order to finance their teaching programs. Today, competitive market pressures provide little incentive for private payers to contribute towards teaching costs. At the same time, the increased use of managed care plans within the Medicaid program has decreased the availability of teaching dollars through Medicaid. Therefore, Medicare's support for graduate medical education is more important than ever. 
   Independent children's hospitals, however, serve an extremely small number of Medicare patients. Therefore, they do not receive Medicare graduate medical education payments to support their teaching activities. The most significant source of graduate medical education financing is, in large part, not available to these hospitals. 
   This proposal will address, for the short-term, this unintended consequence of current public policy. It will provide time-limited support to help children's hospitals train tomorrow's pediatricians, investigate new treatments and pursue pediatric biomedical research. It will establish a four-year fund, which will provide children's hospitals with Federal teaching payments that are based on their per resident costs and the complexity of their patient population. Total spending over four years will be less than a billion dollars. 
   This proposal does not solve the fundamental dilemma of how to cover the cost of training our nation's doctors. Congress has charged the Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare with developing recommendations on this important question--and Congress has directed the Commission to examine teaching support for children's hospitals within these recommendations. I believe the Commission's recommendation will recognize the need to include children's hospitals within the framework of graduate medical education. But in the meantime, this proposal provides the support these hospitals need until these broader questions are answered and addressed. 
   All American families have great dreams for their children. These hopes include healthy, active, happy childhoods, so they seek the best possible health care for their children. And when these dreams are threatened by a critical illness, they seek the expertise of highly-trained pediatricians and pediatric specialists, and rely on the research discoveries fostered by children's hospitals. All families deserve a chance at the American dream. Through this legislation, we will help children's hospitals--hospitals such as Children's Hospital in Omaha, Boys' Town, St. Louis Children's Hospital, Children's Hospital in Boston, Children's Hospital in Seattle+ and others--train the doctors and do the research necessary to fulfill this dream. Through this legislation, Congress will be doing its part to help American families work towards a successful future.

   Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, it is with pleasure that I join Senators MOYNIHAN, ROTH, KENNEDY and JEFFORDS on their significant initiative to expand work opportunities for Americans with disabilities. As Americans, we value the opportunity to support ourselves and our families to the best of our abilities. In fact, we refer to this right and this responsibility as the American dream. But today, millions of Americans who want to work remain on various forms of public assistance, because they can't access the supports they need to begin and continue working. 
   People with disabilities face unique barriers to self-sufficiency. Many of them need certain types of health services, such as home health care and personal care services, in order to work--yet these services are rarely available under employer-sponsored health insurance. Many of them find private health insurance unavailable or unaffordable. Some need vocational rehabilitation services and help finding employment. Others need assistive technology in order to do their job. 
   Currently, health care coverage and other services are linked to two cash programs--Social Security Disability (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income. So people with disabilities must choose whether they want to reach self-sufficiency and risk losing their health coverage and other supportive services, or retain their health insurance but remain dependent on these safety-net programs. At the same time, without personal attendants or other supportive services, they may not be able to work in the first place, or no longer be able to work if their health status is threatened by the loss of the services they can access through health coverage. 
   I do not believe that people who wish to work and support themselves should face this kind of agonizing choice and take these types of risks. However, we can change this Catch-22. The Work Incentives Improvement Act will make several important changes. Most significantly, it will provide new options for Medicaid and Medicare coverage for disabled individuals who enter the workforce, and expand access to employment services for disabled individuals who are building their employment skills. 
   By enabling workers with disabilities to buy-in to the Medicaid program, this legislation will permit Americans with disabilities to enter the workforce without worrying about losing the prescription drug coverage, personal care services, and other health care services they need to work in the first place. It also allows States to establish sliding-scale premiums for workers with higher incomes, therefore ensuring that as workers' income increases, they maintain their health coverage but are less financially dependent on public programs. This proposal will also allow States to continue covering people whose health condition has improved through treatment made possible through Medicaid coverage. Finally, through a ten-year demonstration, the Work Incentives Improvement Act will determine whether permitting SSDI beneficiaries to continue their Medicare coverage is a cost-effective strategy for providing health insurance to individuals who lose SSDI when they return to work. 
   This legislation will also reduce barriers to employment for Americans with disabilities by providing new mechanisms for these individuals to receive the vocational rehabilitation and employment services they need from the providers they choose. In addition, it will encourage SSDI and SSI beneficiaries to develop their skills and venture into the workplace by providing a new assurance that their cash benefits will remain available, if necessary. These individuals may still lose their cash benefits, depending on their working income, but they can be assured that their SSDI and SSI eligibility application would be expedited if their work experience ultimately proves unsuccessful. 
   As we look towards the next century, we know that America's economic strength and sense of national community are dependent on the contributions of each and every American. We need to take the necessary steps to ensure that all Americans will have a chance to enjoy the American dream. Americans with disabilities have the same dreams as the rest of us--including a productive and rewarding working life that enables them to support their families and achieve economic self-sufficiency. We should do our best to help make these dreams a reality.

    Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, while the nation's eyes are turned toward Washington and the Senate impeachment trial, I would like to briefly turn the nation's eyes away from Washington and toward the economic catastrophe that is devastating our family farmers. 
   Prices are falling at alarming rates, and family farms are perishing, as rural America faces its worst crisis since the Great Depression. And to some, it may appear as though Nero is fiddling while Rome burns. 
   So I want to assure my constituents--and indeed all family farmers across our great nation--that while Congress spends it time deciding the fate of the President, some members have not lost sight of their daily struggle to make ends meet, and their fate. 
   On Tuesday, along with Minority Leader Daschle and several other farm state Democratic Senators, we introduced the Agricultural Safety Net and Market Competitiveness Act of 1999. With this legislation we intend to restore an economic safety net to producers and rural communities so that they can remain vital during these times of economic hardship. As well, we proposed ways in which we can revitalize markets--both domestic and abroad--so that all American producers have a fair shot to compete in the marketplace. We also introduced a bill, S. 30, to offset extreme losses to our producers resulting from severe economic and weather-related events. 
   I want my constituents and all family farmers to know that I will welcome the day when we can turn our attentions toward doing the business of the American people, and more specifically American farmers. 
   In the January 18, 1999 edition of the Lincoln Journal Star, farm journalist Alan Guebert wrote a thought provoking piece describing 10 ways in which the average American and American farmer can help regain the power they have lost and continue to lose during this economic catastrophe.
